"Funding details                                                                                                              We often assume that our eyes deliver a detailed image of the world around us, but this is a mistake. Instead, as soon as we want to know the detail in a part of the scene, our eyes flick towards it and the detail is revealed. In this example, perception depends on the world, the motor system and an internal representation that enables the world to act as a 'store' of information that is always retrievable when required. Philosophical theories of 'embodied cognition' emphasise this link between the mind and the motor system. What this analysis lacks, however, is a firm neural and computational grounding specifying the proposed implementation. By looking in detail at a specific version of embodiment that has arisen within the neuroscience community and by exposing it to the critical tools of philosophers, we aim to assess the scope and limits of one particular proposal, and also to draw broader lessons for how neuroscience, robotics and philosophy ought to interact, with respect to these general questions about the nature of cognition.   The network will be inherently multidisciplinary, based on the involvement of mathematicians, engineers, roboticists, psychologists, neuroscientists and philosophers, each with different, complementary inputs. The project is based in Philosophy in Reading, led by a philosopher and already includes key international experts in philosophy of mind and embodied cognition. International experts in neuroscience and robotics have also agreed to take part in the discussion and we will extend the group progressively. The interactions between members of the network will take place through (i) discussion on a wiki page, with new sets of pages being introduced as the debate develops; (ii) joint video conference meetings focused on specific, contentious areas and (iii) a two day conference towards the end of the 12 month period involving international experts in neuroscience, philosophy of mind and cognitive robotics. We will disseminate the results of the network primarily through a Brain and Behavioral Sciences article. This is a forum with high impact in both the philosophical and neuroscience communities. We will also publish more specialist articles in journals for neuroscience, engineering and philosophy.  By the end of the year, we will develop a more public-facing portal to the wiki and encourage engagement with a broader audience outside academia. At this point we will use facilities such as ResearchGate to reach a wider group of researchers and social media such as Twitter to advertise the discussion within and beyond the academic community.","The most immediate planned impacts of the work will be in applied fields such as robotics and the guidance of autonomous vehicles. Currently, the predominant type of representation is based on a 3D, world-centred frame. There are good reasons to believe that this explicit reconstruction is rather different from the way that humans or other animals represent their environment and the robotics community has a strong interest in developing workable alternatives. For example, we collaborate with Paul Newman who heads the Mobile Robotics Group in Oxford and there is a keen interest within the MRG for developing novel, view-based approaches to navigation and mapping, of the kind our network will investigate. The pathways to impact document expands on the pathways by which the network can influence the development of this type of representation. In computer vision, there may also be impact in the medium term. Here, we collaborate with researchers at Microsoft Research who are interested in object representation and scene representation using image-based techniques that avoid 3D reconstruction. The development of this type of approach is likely to be informed by biological models and human experiments of the sort that are central to the topic discussed in the network. The proposal about brain-function which our network will discuss is partly inspired by problems and developments in computer vision, and this is a topic where theoretical and practical developments provide crucial feedback for one another. Again, the pathways to impact document provides more detail on the way that these links with industry will be developed. Of course, the long term consequences of discovering a coherent description of brain function including perception, action and thought will be far reaching, with a profound impact on many areas of health, education and industry. The research network will also contribute to this wider long term goal.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN006011%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The goal of the project is to provide a description of some of the major differences between the dialects of Kurdish. The only comparative work on the dialects of the area was conducted by MacKenzie and published in 1961, based on eight major locations. Kurdish autonomy in northern Iraq and the rise in the importance of communications in Kurdish in Iraq and lately also in neighbouring Turkey (along with the ongoing intensification of Kurdish cultural activities in northern Syria) make this a timely investigation. Using a questionnaire and samples of free speech, we will interview emigrant Kurds in England and France and, relying on the assistance of students and colleagues at the universities of Mardin (Turkey), Soran and Suleimani (Iraq), also in the Kurdish regions. We aim to cover major structural variants representing up to 50 origin locations. The results will be made freely accessible on an online database, in the form of transcriptions of words and phrases, sound files, and maps representing the location of each variant. The tool will help raise awareness of Kurdish and may support educational and language planning efforts. The project draws on a successful pilot project funded by a Small Grant from the British Academy, during which a data collection method was developed and tested, a database prototype was developed, initial samples were collected and entered into that database, and links have been establishment with three Kurdish-language departments at the universities named above, on which we shall be able to draw for fieldwork. The pilot project also established close links with immigrant Kurdish communities in England and France, on which we will rely for much of the fieldwork. Initial results of the pilot project will be visible online from February 2012 on http://kurdish.humanities.manchester.ac.uk. The project will be led by a PI (Matras) who is one of very few specialists in Kurdish linguistics, and a co-PI (Koontz-Garboden) who is a leading specialist in the study of verb semantics and verb derivational morphology and morpho-syntax. The project will thus be in a position to make a major contribution toward the application of theoretical-linguistic insights to Kurdish and to draw on Kurdish as a case study to help illuminate issues that are of interest to the general linguistic discussion in these fields. The project team will cooperate closely with Dr Salih Akin, a Kurdish linguist at Rouen University (France), who will support the project's strategy to access Kurdish communities, train fieldworkers, and interpret some of the data. The project team has also received expressions of support and assurances of cooperation in regard to the project's outreach strategy from the Kurdish Regional Government, the Kurdish Institute in Paris, and the Kurdish Library in Stockholm. The project will therefore be in the best possible position to deliver a novel and innovative contribution to the study of Kurdish, to the enrichment of linguistic-typological discussions through examples from Kurdish, and to raising general awareness of the Kurdish language and its dialect continuum.","A major non-academic beneficiary of the online resource that the project will develop will be the population of Kurds residing both in the Middle East and in western Europe and their cultural associations. Among many Kurdish communities, especially those from Turkey, knowledge of Kurdish has been in decline due to a variety of social and political factors, among them emigration and lack of educational resources in the language. The database resource and the website that hosts it will help raise awareness of the Kurdish language and will provide a practical tool for Kurds wishing to familiarise themselves with the structures and forms of other dialects of the language, as well as with constructions of the language in general. This impact has already been registered through reactions of the Kurdish communities in Manchester and in Paris. In addition, prominent Kurdish cultural organisations such as the Institut Kurde de Paris and the Kurdish Library in Stockholm, Kurdish Regional Government representatives in London and Paris, and Kurdish language departments at a number of universities in Turkey and in Iraq have taken a direct interest in the pilot project funded by the British Academy (2011-2012). The potential impact on the community is also confirmed from the experience of the applicant's projects on Romani, where a similar resource has been accessed online by well over 200,000 people from over 40 countries during just a six-year period. The online resource and the resulting publications on geographical variation in Kurdish will also assist forensic linguists engaged in Language Analyses for the Determination of Origin (LADO). The database and its mapping tool will provide a way of verifying the mapping of linguistic variables onto geographical locations and will thus be able to support individuals in their cases for asylum and immigration status. The online resource will be freely accessible and so practitioners will be able to make use of it. It will also serve as a teaching and learning tool for students of linguistics especially in the Kurdish areas, and as an opportunity to provide much needed training in Kurdish linguistics for the benefit of the newly emerging degree courses in Kurdish language in Iraq and in Turkey. The project will further extend its outreach to policymakers and, following in the footsteps of Matras' report on Romani to the Council of Europe's Language Policy Division (October 2005), the PI will draft a report on dialect diversity and codification in Kurdish, to be shared with the Expert Committee for the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Kurdish Regional Government, Kurdish cultural associations in Europe, and Kurdish language departments in the Middle East.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007084%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              2022 marks the conclusion of the AHRC-funded pilot project Two Centuries of Indian Print (2CIP) and the 75th anniversary of Indian independence, as well as other important national events across South Asia. We propose to showcase 2CIP's cataloguing, digitisation and research outputs and celebrate India's print, film and literary history with a dedicated events programme that aims to maximise the impact of such programmes and demonstrate their role in documenting collections and making them available, as well as engaging with new users and diversifying British Library audiences. 2CIP was largely focused on East India and East Indian languages such as Bengali, Assamese and Sylheti. As a result, 2CIP events, such as the October 2021 Bangladesh 50 at the British Library, were often oriented towards British Bangladeshi visitors. Through arranging events aimed at multiple British South Asian communities, the proposed India 75 Events project will be able to sustain existing relationships with the British Bangladeshi community as well as form new connections with other British Asian communities. Therefore, this project's programme of events will have a wide appeal to both general and academic audiences, as well as multiple British South Asian communities through celebrating the region's diversity of languages and cultures. Proposed events include Community Show and Tells, Workshops, Seminars and Film Screenings for interested audiences in the UK and India. These events would also contribute to laying the foundation for wider plans being developed that seek to broaden the regional and linguistic focus of future South Asian collections conservation, digitisation and research projects. The impact of this programme of events will benefit British Asian community groups and non-academic audiences who will become more familiar with the Library's South Asia holdings and feel more confident accessing the collection items for their own interest and research, for example, research into their particular cultural and regional heritage. The Library in turn will foster stronger relationships by proactively engaging with South Asian communities both in London and beyond.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX000516%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              'The History of Financial Advice' provides the first thorough study of a genre of writing that has amassed a huge readership, and had major social and economic effects, but which has remained largely neglected by cultural and economic historians and by literary critics. As Lendol Calder writes in the recent Oxford Handbook of the History of Consumption (2012), 'the print culture that helped people make sense of money through financial advice', still 'awaits its historian', despite the fact that 'concerns about money - how to get it, how to save it, how to invest, multiply and spend it - have likely sold more books in the last two hundred years than any other subject after religion'. The project charts the history of personal financial advice literature as it has developed in Britain and the United States, ranging from the private letters and domestic advice manuals of the eighteenth century to the emergence of financial journalism and investment advice in the nineteenth century to the proliferation of popular financial novels, lifestyle guides and blogs in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Drawing on approaches to the study of rhetoric and narrative central to literary and cultural studies, the project investigates how works of financial advice have succeeded in appealing to the desires and fantasies of their readers, despite a lack of evidence for the efficacy of the investment strategies such works propound. Making use of the strand of social science known as 'Cultural Economy', the project also considers how financial advice has shaped public perceptions of, and activities in, financial markets, such that the genre has actively made and remade the very markets about which it advises. The project team will make a major contribution to the scholarship on popular interactions with finance by researching and writing the first comprehensive study of the history of financial advice in Britain and the United States, beginning in the Financial Revolution of the early eighteenth century and moving through to the present. Members of the team will share this research with fellow researchers at prominent international conferences in the fields of cultural, economic and business history. The project team will also build on established relationships with representatives of the financial services industry, as well as financial regulators, educators, charities and policy makers, to share ideas in workshops, provide training sessions and collaborate in the development of initiatives in financial literacy, regulatory policy and professional practice. As part of the project, the team will collect, catalogue and annotate an archive of financial advice literature. Acquisition of the archive will be funded by the UK's first dedicated library of financial writing, run by Didasko the financial education charity, which will also provide a permanent home for the collection, where it will be available for consultation by students, academics, industry trainees and the general public, aided by a purpose-written guide produced by the project team. The key findings of the research will also be made readily and widely accessible to the public through the production of a short film to the made available online, with the working title 'What Three Centuries of Financial Advice Can Teach You'. 'The History of Financial Advice' will both mark a landmark in scholarship and achieve a major impact on the ways in which financial 'insiders' and 'outsiders' alike think about and participate in markets.","What the cultural commentator Randy Martin calls 'the financialization of daily life' means that increasing numbers of citizens have little choice but to act as personal portfolio managers. They are now responsible for assessing risks and seeking optimal strategies across an array of asset classes and liabilities, from investments, property and pensions to credit cards, mortgages and student debt, as the traditional structures of the welfare state (in the UK) and corporate welfare (in the US) are being eroded and privatised. Understandably, many such individuals turn to forms of popular financial advice in navigating their complex personal finances. In the absence of resources that would provide them with a clear understanding of the history of financial advice, its rhetorical forms and modes of address, and its social and economic effects, however, members of the public are likely to be ill-equipped adequately to assess and interpret the advice they consume. By the same token, financial professionals, policy makers, regulators, educators and journalists lack the detailed historical research into the changing social, economic and cultural functioning of financial advice that would help them to contextualize and evaluate their own practices and recommendations. In the wake of the global financial crisis, calls for the financial services industry and those concerned with it to attend to the 'culture' of finance have grown progressively louder; financial advice is an aspect of that culture that demands, especially urgently, to be more systematically researched and better understood, and 'The History of Financial Advice' meets this demand. The project will benefit members of the general public by improving their understanding of the historical and present-day forms and functions of financial advice, enabling them to be more astute, knowledgeable and discerning consumers of such advice. The quality of public debate about financial advice will be significantly enriched by the establishment of an archive of financial advice literature - available for public consultation and fully annotated - at the UK's only dedicated library of financial writing, the Library of Mistakes in Edinburgh; through the production of a short online-distributed film, with the working title 'What Three Centuries of Financial Advice Can Teach You'; and by means of social media, a project blog and other online outlets and regional and national press, television and radio. Through a workshop organised by the Finance Foundation, the project will benefit financial policy makers, regulators and practitioners by assisting them to better grasp how financial advice has shaped popular perceptions of, and activities in, financial markets, and the social and economic consequences that have stemmed from such non-professional or 'vernacular' engagement. Finally, the project will work with the UK's leading financial education and enterprise charity Young Enterprise to improve financial literary education (now a compulsory part of the National Curriculum), by developing new teaching materials drawn from the project's research findings.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003241%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Violence Security Peace (VSP) Network represents an interdisciplinary, cross-sector initiative with representatives from 21 institutions and organizations in 13 different countries throughout 4 regions of the world. It brings together academics and practitioners to address the issue of trust in societies trying to find their way out of war and other forms of organized violence and insecurity. The following questions guide Network activities: what can these geographically dispersed groups teach each other about peacebuilding? And, what do the differences between the comparative contexts teach us about the possibilities and limits of trust-building after war more generally?  Network members have theoretical and applied methodological training from world leading academic institutions; they also deliver a wealth of experience in the practical application of institutional strengthening, measurement, and accountability. The collaborative work produced by the VSP Network supports UN SDG 16 goals by working in service of a demonstrable impact on reducing all forms of violence, the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict, and strengthening the rule of law. The PI and CO-I draw from applied experience and professional training in leadership and collaborative team building to guide this initiative's design. The PI's own research focuses on interpersonal trust-building in the aftermath of war factors, and guides the theoretical framing - i.e., the assertion that this is the primordial factor for building sustainable peace. The collaborations within the VSP Network will take on the two tensions inherent to the relationship between trust and peacebuilding. First, the betrayals experienced within the context of war and war-like violence corrode trust at all levels of society. Second, armed conflict will inevitably endure and re-emerge without solving the problems of trust. War and violence fuels distrust and distrust fuels war and violence. The Network will mobilize the wealth of expertise of its members and result in collaborations that will involve and impact practitioners and program designers in this field. It employs a participatory decision-making framework, modelling through action the kinds of practices it intends to foster in the host countries of its members. A touchstone of this inclusive approach involves including former non-state armed actors and military combat veterans who have transitioned from conflict and now mentor others through organizations dedicated to supporting these social transformations. We examine experiences in the context of peacebuilding classed under 're': reintegration, reinsertion, return, rehabilitation, and reconciliation. In addition to the initial VSP Network membership, the PI and CO-I will draw from the wealth of available institutional resources. The Network will operate in dialogue with LSE IDEAS, which is planning with the UN Trust Fund for Human Security to implement a partnership with UN agencies and businesses. We will also coordinate with the UKRI GCRF Gender, Justice and Security Hub and the LSE Conflict, Justice and Peace Platform to promote knowledge exchange through online events with Global South researchers and increase the impact and reach of our findings. The CO-I will engage with the institutional supports made available by the Interdisciplinary Centre for the Study of Development (CIDER) at the Universidad de los Andes Management School.  The VPS Network will develop the experiential and empirical base to make significant contributions to theory and practice in a variety of disciplines in the humanities (ethics, moral philosophy, arts-based methodologies of engagement) and beyond (e.g., anthropology and public policy). It will result in near- and long-term impact for those working everyday to facilitate trust-building and sustainable peace initiatives across a wide range of comparative contexts.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW009935%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will examine the relationship between judges, judgment and visual media. The judge is an important figure in our society, epitomizing key values and virtues associated with good decision making, fairness, justice and legitimate authority. The media and visual media in particular play a crucial role shaping and communicating representations of judges and judging. Studying their content, production, management and consumption provides new opportunities to examine popular and official representations of good judgment, fairness, and legitimate authority. To do this we will bring together a variety of scholars, practitioners and users to open up new debate about how images of judges and judging are managed, made and consumed.   The topic is multi-dimensional. One element is the long but largely neglected history of judicial image making. This ranges from 14th century funeral monuments, to painted portraits, etchings, photographs and most recently screen images. The architecture and theatre of the courtroom central to the staging and performance of judicial authority and judgment are other elements.   24 hour multichannel TV and view on demand facilities now make watching and scrutinizing judges and judgment an intimate, enduring and ever present possibility in the comfort of the home. Some representations are fictional: domestic and imported courtroom drama. Some are factual, the live streaming and YouTube summary judgments of the UK Supreme Court , TV broadcasts of sentencing decisions currently limited to Scotland and footage of real trials mainly from the US. Others, such as reality TV judges, be it 'Judge Judy' or the judges on Strictly Come Dancing, blur fact and fiction. New technologies (mobile phones, tablets, internet platforms) also create potential for new producers of images, such as 'citizen journalists' to enter the field and new ways of viewing.   Television's apparent preoccupation with judges and judgment potentially creates new levels of 'legal knowledge', new confusions and expectations both realistic and unrealistic about the nature and qualities of good judging. Initiatives to improve the quality of representations, redesigning courtrooms, new court communication initiatives, reforms to allow cameras in courts and debates on the media's role in promoting and undermining confidence in courts are all the subject of intense debate.   The time is ripe for a new multidisciplinary engagement with the nature of judicial images, their production, management, and their effect, particularly their capacity to enhance 'openness', achieve greater 'transparency' or promote 'accountability'. Our aim is to explore the how and why of the production and use of such images. The project will involve three themed symposia; image making, image management, image consumption. One key objective is to use these events to build an international network of leading and early career academics from different disciplines such as law, art history, semiotics, media and communications studies to discuss the current state of knowledge and identify methodological innovations for future research. Another is to bring to the network practitioners in the field such as judges, court communications staff, architects, artists, curators and filmmakers from across jurisdictions, organisations and practices to explore the lived experience of production and consumption. We also seek to break away from traditional academic papers to include site visits and active use of visual media to enhance the work of the symposia. Key practical benefits of this project will include raising stakeholder awareness of the historical and contemporary nature and significance of visual imagery in the communication of ideas about judges, judging and justice. It will contribute to citizen awareness and education. Finally it seeks to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public communications relating to the judiciary and confidence in the judiciary.","A primary goal is to generate widespread stakeholder discussion of the relationship between the justice system and visual media and to prompt changes in the ways stakeholders engage with this interface. In pursuit of its Impact Strategy this project will connect with five groups of actors (a) those who produce images of the judiciary; (b) those whose images are being produced; (c) communications managers and policy makers; (d) the general public and (e) the next generation of lawyers. The impact strategy will aim to challenge the way that lawyers, artists and the public think about, and utilise, legal images. It is anticipated that this project will enhance the quality of, and debate about, visual languages as they relate to legal subjects within two years of the project start.  1. The Workshops Judges, commercial visual image makers (film and video, photography, artists, architects), journalists and court communications staff will feature prominently in this project. Practitioners will be central to the setting of agendas for the three planned workshops. Each of the workshops will be designed to facilitate discussion between practitioners and academics and will deliberately seek to explore the interface between their various perspectives and present novel ideas about representation strategies. Visual materials from the seminars will be made available for download on our dedicated website. It is anticipated that these workshop will generate new ideas and ways of thinking about the production of images of the judiciary. 2. Website The first most enduring output from this project will be a website which will be aimed at all of our target audiences. Materials from the workshops including podcasts, interviews with participants, images and films used by speakers will made accessible through the site. Drawing on their own research the applicants will add to these materials by designing a virtual exhibition of images relating to a variety of different contemporary and historical representations of the judiciary. Visitors to the site will be encouraged to comment on their reaction to the images, make suggestions for additions and to post their own published work there.  Engagement with the exhibition and other materials will be encouraged through two sorts of partnerships. The first will involve collaboration with a group of at least five UK law schools. This will allow the applicants to engage with the next generation of lawyers. The second will involve a partnership with a small group of teachers involved in designing and delivering citizen programmes. It is anticipated that the site and exhibition will provide a valuable resource for teachers and students by providing resources for classes which might focus on issues around legitimacy and authority. To encourage feedback and input into the project Facebook and Twitter facilities will also be linked to the website and the mailing lists of subject associations used to publicise it. Feedback will be monitored and feed into the issues discussed in the final workshop and public lecture. It is hoped that in time the resources provided on the website can be developed with other groups such as the Judicial College.  3. A Public lecture One of the most important functions of the workshops will be the setting of agendas for future research and dialogue with policy makers. In order to publicise the outcomes of debate the applicants will organise a public lecture which will be held after the workshops. An expert panel comprised of leading members of the judiciary, press, a filmmaker and policy maker will be asked to lead a public debate on an issue which has emerged in the course of the workshops and is likely to capture the public imagination. The LSE events division has considerable experience of hosting events aimed at the public audiences and maximising publicity from them.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL007290%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project develops the impact of the open access digital edition The Collected Letters of Robert Southey: 1791-1815. Loved and loathed by his contemporaries, Southey (1774-1843) was a highly controversial Romantic Poet Laureate, essayist and historian. He lived for 40 years in the north Lake District market town of Keswick and his grave is in one of the town's churchyards. The Keswick Museum holds a unique, substantial and underused collection of manuscripts, books, portraits and other items by and associated with Southey, his family and his friends. This archive was a key resource for The Collected Letters.  Keswick Museum is the major local heritage organisation. In 2017-8 it welcomed 19,419 visitors and provided on-site educational sessions to c.5600 schoolchildren from the immediate surrounding area. This project will collaborate with Keswick Museum to help it transform the way it is able to present the significance of Southey and his circle to its visitors and to key stage 2 school teachers and pupils in the region.  The project's objectives are: to increase Keswick Museum's ability to present Southey and his circle as a visitor attraction.  to develop Keswick Museum's on-site, sustainable expertise in its Southey collections.  to collaborate with Keswick Museum to create a resource encouraging visitors to explore 'Southey's Keswick' and to discover and enjoy a key part of the town's cultural heritage.  to extend the reach and range of Keswick Museum's KS2 education programme, particularly in literacy, and embed Southey and his circle in it for the first time.  to develop awareness and knowledge of Southey and his relationship to Keswick as part of the region's wider Cultural Tourism strategy.  The project team will achieve these by working with Keswick Museum to develop new attractions that draw on its Southey collection. These will include a display of the Museum's Southey holdings, a guidebook, a leaflet taking visitors on a walking tour of 'Southey's Keswick', and educational materials for use by Key Stage 2 teachers and pupils working on literacy. The latter will include a 'touring box' that can be used by those local schools who are unable to visit the Museum. The project will further enrich visitors' experiences by training Keswick Museum's volunteers to interpret the new Southey display for visitors and to give guided walking tours. A publicity release for Lakes Culture will further promote 'Southey's Keswick'. This work is important and timely because it engages with two areas of well-defined local need: the tourist economy and education. The Lake District is exceptionally dependent on tourism to sustain its economy and attracts 41m. visits every year. Keswick is still recovering from the severe floods of 2016, and wishes to develop and grow all aspects of its ability to attract visitors. The literary heritage of Keswick and the north Lakes is rich, but comparatively under-developed. It has no sites that can compare with the visitor numbers attracted to sites in the south Lakes associated with Beatrix Potter (250k visitors p.a.) and William Wordsworth (50k visitors p.a.). This will use a key local resource (the Southey collection at Keswick Museum) to raise the visibility and attraction both of a key local celebrity (Southey) and of local cultural heritage. It thus offers a significant opportunity to enhance the value of a potentially important cultural destination in the north Lakes area. By collaborating with Keswick Museum to enhance and extend its work with schools, the project will also contribute to local educational agendas. It will allow teachers and pupils from the region to use and benefit from new learning resources that draw on their local literary heritage and their local history. For the first time, the provision of a 'touring box' will make Keswick Museum's educational offer available to those schools that are further afield and unable to visit the Museum in person.","This project provides an opportunity to create both value and benefits arising from the original AHRC-funded research on The Collected Letters of Robert Southey both for non-academic collaborators, primarily Keswick Museum (KM), and for the wider public of local residents and businesses in Keswick and the north Lakes and visitors to this area. The project seeks to build a range of interactions and engagements which will allow KM to make much better use of its Southey collection and to use these holdings to enhance and enrich the experience of local people, including schoolchildren, and visitors to Keswick.  KM will benefit in three key ways: 1. KM will be able for the first time to take intellectual control of its Southey holdings, one of its greatest assets, by creating an extensive and engaging display of Southey material, supported by appropriate labelling and information and by an interpretative guidebook.  2. KM will be enabled to greatly enhance its educational outreach activities and outreach constituency by producing learning materials related to its Southey holdings that can be used to develop literacy in KS2 pupils and that can be easily delivered both on-site and in those schools where economic constraints prevent teachers and pupils visiting KM in person. 3. KM's Southey holdings will be used to encourage KM's visitors to explore Southey-related sites in Keswick and the surrounding area, through guided tours by trained volunteers, a leaflet and the creation of a publicity release and a draft cultural itinerary for Lakes Culture.  The project therefore will better equip KM to fulfil its mission to bring key people, events, objects and places from Keswick's past alive in ways that are meaningful for its twenty-first century audiences, both those interested in cultural heritage and local KS2 teachers and pupils. By so doing the project hopes to increase footfall in KM and also to Keswick and the north Lakes, and to increase KM's ability to reach more schools with its KS2 literacy work.  Moreover, this project will also enrich the experience of those interacting with the Southey collection at KM. The permanent display and guidebook will make accessible a much wider range of Southey material and allow its significance to be interpreted more fully by local people and visitors. The volunteer guides will be trained to link KM's Southey-related exhibits to Keswick and the surrounding area and enhance the appreciation of users of these sites, allowing them to put them in a deeper cultural context. The KS2 learning materials will provide a new and engaging way of teaching literacy to schoolchildren through material related to KM's holdings and to their local environment. The educational 'touring box' will also allow KM to engage with a larger constituency of schools thus enabling a broader range of children to engage with and benefit from a fresh understanding of their local cultural heritage and history. The publicity release for Lakes Culture will advertise the project widely and the draft cultural itinerary has the potential to support businesses and organisations seeking to grow their appeal to cultural tourists. The project will therefore reach out to a wide audience of both local people and visitors (7m. p.a. to Keswick), ensuring the widest possible impact on its beneficiaries.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT001925%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Impressions of seal matrices in disks of wax, deliberately preserved with their parent documents as part of the legal and administrative process of authentication, survive in great numbers in British archives. Since, by the later thirteenth century, seals came to be used by almost all levels of society, the imagery and wording on seals, along with sealing practices and techniques, offer great potential for historical research. In the last few years, and in particular as a consequence of the AHRC-funded Seals in Medieval Wales (SiMeW) and British Academy Seals in a Local Context (SiLC) projects, this potential is increasingly being realised. Importantly, the back of the wax on which seal impressions are found often retains the image of unique hand prints (finger, thumb or palm) but although sometimes commented upon these have, until now, been neglected as a source of information. They do, however, provide direct evidence of those involved in the act of sealing. But whose prints are they?  Imprint, which offers a genuine and mutually beneficial collaboration between History and forensic science, will use a range of methods for hand mark identification, including cutting-edge practice in digital imaging and the analysis of marks using both manual and Automated Fingerprint Identification System techniques. Images of c.1,200-1,500 medieval seals which are still associated with their parent documents will be taken to specifications which satisfy both the needs of historical research and forensic analysis. From an historical perspective, the results will enable an innovative investigation of the practice of sealing in a documentary context, and will allow the project team to consider what the identification of these prints can tell us about how sealing practices may have evolved concurrently with administrative and legal practices. More generally, the project will shed new light on social networks, rituals associated with exchange, and the bureaucracies and protocols of authentication and security in medieval England and Wales.  On the forensics side, the study will provide data which is pertinent to on-going areas of research in Identity Science, providing a significant quantity of material from a period long before existing banks of fingerprint data, and contribute to discussions about the uniqueness of fingerprints and their evidential validity. This research is timely in promoting links between the Humanities and Forensic science, as urged in the UK government Silverman Report on Research and Development in Forensic Science (2011) which notes the value of interdisciplinary research using forensic science, to create project Impact as well as scholarly results. It is also a natural progression from the recent work of SiMeW and SiLC, upon whose expertise we are drawing.  A pilot for the project, using seals from Hereford Cathedral Archive, has demonstrated that the methodology is sound: we recovered usable prints from 37% of the material surveyed, and traditional print recognition techniques revealed that particular individuals do recur.","Imprint will benefit professionals with curatorial responsibility for medieval documents. The five archive repositories directly involved in the project will gain digital images of sealed instruments and associated detailed information about the seals that can be incorporated into the host repositories' catalogues. The RAs will also be able to provide useful information about the condition of the collections investigated, for example identifying any items in need of conservation or re-housing. The findings may also provide valuable and potentially high-profile insights into items in the collections, for example were matches to be found between prints on the supposed 'Anglo-Saxon' charters and genuine 12th century documents at Westminster Abbey (medieval forgery 'case solved'!) Repositories with substantial medieval collections but not directly involved will also be able to benefit from dissemination of the methodology and information about how their material could be enhanced by such projects, for example in terms of making medieval documents seem less remote for general audiences by revealing insights into the circumstances in which these items were created. In addition, the co-investigators are currently writing an article based upon the pilot project for submission to the journal Archives, and as part of Imprint we would hold workshops specifically aimed at archival professionals, based in areas near the archives we will be using in our research. These workshops, and specialist classes for archive students, would provide cutting-edge skills and knowledge for current curators and the next generation of those caring for sealed documents. More broadly, through its website, and by working alongside partner repositories to produce online exhibitions and workshops, the project will allow the general public a vivid insight into medieval life through the investigation of very tangible objects, and by demonstrating the synergies to be found in collaborations between the humanities and science. We envisage that the project would therefore have widespread media appeal, and in addition to a TV documentary, for which the project team is already in informal talks with BBC4 through the University of Lincoln's director for public engagement, the project team will also write an article for consideration by a 'popular' history publication (target publications: BBC History Magazine, History Today, Archaeology Today).  From a scientific perspective, Imprint will contribute important information to current debates in forensics and allow the testing of theories concerning the identification of finger and hand prints, as well as informing a number of international projects and current Home Office initiatives. For example, through data from the finger and palm prints on wax seals, statistical information can be gleaned concerning the uniqueness of finger and hand marks through comparison of medieval marks (different demographic at a different time) and thus those of the present day using existing AFIS systems within the UK and potentially in other countries, previously unknown statistical data can be derived to add evidence concerning the uniqueness of fingerprints; a matter of international concern in the forensic world, and will address a number of the recommendations made in Sir Anthony Campbell's 2011 Scottish Inquiry Report into the mis-identification of Shirley McKie. This information can be built into data regarding the likelihood ratios associated with finger and palm mark identification and advance finger mark identification as a science. Imprint's forensic advisers will present the data gathered at conferences, Home Office Workshops & Training Courses and after the project's end will print seek to publish its final conclusions in academic journals in their field such as Forensic Science International.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM010813%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Dunham's Data pioneers the use of data analysis in dance history through a project that centres around the case study of Katherine Dunham (1909-2006). The African American choreographer, anthropologist, teacher, curator, and author had a profound influence on dance internationally. As a choreographer and performer, she was involved with Broadway shows, operas, revues, Hollywood films, and modern concert dance. As a cultural operator she worked for and with groups ranging from important African American organizations to the United States Army, and she was also employed by both the writing and theatre arms of the Works Progress Administration. As a scholar, she contributed to the development of participant-observer ethnographic methods, and her work also anticipates the contemporary phenomenon of practice-based research. Her curatorial and administrative work ranges from curating festivals in Dakar, to building multiple cultural institutions, namely the Dunham School in New York and the Katherine Dunham Museum and Children's Workshop in St. Louis. Dunham is an exemplary figure for analysing the ways dance moves across both geographical locations and networks of cultural, artistic, and financial capital. In addition to working across many diverse contexts, she spent over one third of her life on tour. The scale and distribution of datapoints necessary to research the transnational circulation of an artist like Dunham pose a challenge for traditional scholarly approaches. Thus, tracing such global movement requires new scholarly tools. For this project, we construct digital maps that track Dunham's travel undertaken as a touring artist as well as the ways in which her works represented place. We graph the networks Dunham built across people and institutions as she conducted ethnographic research, choreographed dances, created a dance technique, and participated in social justice movements. Using such digital research methods and data visualization in the context of dance history can catalyse a better understanding of how dance movements are shared and circulated among people and continents, and the networks of support and influence that undergird artistic and economic success. In so doing we ultimately ask how dance moves between places, and how the world is imagined in dance. At the same time as we investigate the mobility of this particular historical figure, we also address the scholarly concerns that make collecting, analysing, and visualizing data meaningful for dance historical inquiry. Digital methods have altered the landscape of most humanities and arts disciplines. However, the field of dance studies has not yet realized how it can benefit from these analytic approaches, in particular for historical work, and what it can contribute to interdisciplinary conversations. Therefore, this project is not only devoted to the specific line of research regarding Dunham, but also to the original problems and questions of dance history that can be advanced through an innovative critical mixed methods approach that includes geographical mapping and network analysis.  The project scope is extended through knowledge exchange collaborations with international academic partner projects, as well as through UK industry partnerships with the Victoria & Albert Museum and One Dance UK's Dance of the African Diaspora.","A major impact of this research is to contextualize the life and work of an important African American female figure and make her particular transnational story available for public consumption in the current age of ethnonationalism. The research capitalises on Dunham's existing position as a figure of public interest to present new ways of interpreting and analysing Dunham's mobility as well as other black transdisciplinary histories. Through the public Dunham|Data|Dance website and public events, the project incorporates and shares local and non-academic knowledges in ways that will be accessible and engaging for multiple stakeholders, including user groups beyond the academy. Beneficiaries will include those tied to the legacies of African diasporic cultural production (music, theatre, dance, literature), particularly general publics outside of the US who otherwise have limited physical and intellectual access to these materials. In addition to a general audience, this project will benefit a more specific public, namely the global community that has arisen around Dunham through the legacy of her technique and community engagement, including the Katherine Dunham Centers for the Arts and Humanities which act as an umbrella for many Dunham legacy organizations, including regular technique 'seminars' and symposia. Many of the expert users that we commission will be drawn from Dunham dancers and other artists deeply versed in the Africanist aesthetics and inheritances that this work makes available. This includes members of the One Dance UK's Dance of the African Diaspora, which is a project partner. The digital visualizations will serve as a prompt for recollection, benefitting this community by offering a catalyst and site to archive their own stories. By beta-testing with multiple stakeholders, we will develop collaborative forms of interpretation that benefits this community by increasing their shared knowledge base and ultimately deepening their understanding of Dunham. Another area of impact is archives with holdings on Dunham, including Southern Illinois University Carbondale, the Library of Congress, Missouri Historical Society Library and Research Center, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, and University of Arkansas Libraries at Fayetteville. Sharing detailed metadata for individual archival documents spread across these archives will transform the current generic finding aids by increasing their granularity and searchability and thus increasing their usability. Created in dialogue with the archivists, our development of granular archival metadata will add value to the archives by increasing collections knowledge for the archivists themselves, enabling them to better understand what they hold. Linking and cross-referencing collections will provide a more holistic picture of Dunham and further facilitate collaboration between collections. This will in turn increase access to these materials for researchers outside the US. SIU and the Library of Congress have already made plans to use our datasets. Finally, there is the impact in terms of our industry partners, One Dance UK and the Victoria and Albert Museum. This project benefits the V&A mission to re-access cultural history, as well as One Dance UK's mission for Dance of the African Diaspora to collect and narrate the heritage that informs the work of black dancers in contemporary Britain; through our knowledge exchange, we will draw together these UK stories and place them in international context for the dance and other publics. We will further widen and deepen engagement with greater publics through blog posts for both partners, as well as a workshop on artistic networks at the V&A, through which we will connect our two partners. In addition, informal knowledge exchange with V&A staff during the training workshop and leading up to their 2020 exhibit on dance has the potential to change how they understand and work with their collections.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR012989%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              From its creation to its demise, CABE fronted a national drive for better design in the built environment. It was a unique organisation (worldwide) and a full understanding of its work and impact will be of international significance. This proposal, however, goes much further. It aims to use the experience of CABE as a means to illuminate some fundamental questions about the role, nature and legitimacy of design as a public policy tool and whether, how and to what degree the state should engage in such concerns in the future. Four key lines of enquiry will be traced: o The toolbox - CABE represented an attempt, through 'active government', to address a perceived (although contested) failure of the market to recognise the importance of good design. But, given the absence of any statutory powers, CABE could be seen as the 'David' of design against the 'Goliath' of the property market. Despite this, CABE was able to deploy a range of potentially powerful tools to achieve its desired ends, including: evidence, publicity, information sharing, guidance, improvement tools, assistance, monitoring, persuading, coalition building, education, and evaluation. Each tool encompasses a complex set of endeavours and determining the relative significance, challenges and impact of such tools will provide valuable incites into the effectiveness of design governance processes and to where public policy and investment in this area should be focused in the future. o Shifting governance - CABE's work was situated within a belief that by understanding the processes of design, generic principles might be derived to optimise the performance of players. CABE itself was also embedded within wider political and governance trends, demonstrating how evaluation of design governance needs to be situated within an understanding of this wider context. Today, as this context shifts, an understanding of recent episodes of design governance will throw light on potential future models in an area of public policy to be delivered across lower tiers of government, directly by communities, and with a less direct steer from the centre. o Political context - The contemporary effort to address questions of design through public policy began in the mid-90s. This 'design agenda' prospered throughout the New Labour years, whilst in the run-up to the 2010 election the Conservatives re-committed themselves to the same goals, although not to CABE. Understanding this history, the motivations of those involved and the political consensus surrounding design, as well as it's fit within the evolving urban policy landscape will be critical to understanding the potential and likely trajectory of the design agenda in the future and how, to stay relevant, the practice of design governance will need to evolve with it. o Design problematics - As the role, influence and size of CABE grew, so did criticisms; underlining the challenging nature of public policy in this area, and how design is different from many 'big ticket' policy remits in critical ways. Today, as urban policy moves to a localism agenda, design is likely to come increasingly to the fore, although now without a strong national voice to assist in the process. Evaluating the unique public policy characteristics and problematics of design in the built environment and how they have been addressed (or not) in the recent past will be critical to understanding how design might be addressed in the age of austerity and localism as well as to understanding the wider moral / societal case for such intervention in the future. An inductive research methodology is proposed that journeys from the specifics of practice to a broad theory of design governance. Building on a completed pump-priming phase that safeguarded evidence prior to CABE's demise, a multi-dimensional impact analysis is now proposed in four stages: analytical framework; organisational interrogation; first-hand opinions; and impact & legacy analysis.","Capturing the CABE experience The demise of CABE in 2011 and its replacement by the much smaller and more focussed Design Council CABE provides an important moment for a fundamental look at the design agenda, and an opportunity to use the experience of CABE as a window through which to illuminate the wider subject. The pump-priming project provided an opportunity to safeguard important documentary evidence, start to map programmes, outputs, etc., and to establish systems for retaining contact with key stakeholders to continue a dialogue. A first major impact of the research will simply be to understand the role and legacy of CABE and to safeguard knowledge of the CABE experiment for the future. Without a full and critical evaluation of its work, knowledge of this unique experience will be quickly lost. Understanding design as a public policy tool In tackling the two detailed evaluative questions, the empirical work will offer the opportunity for a dispassionate interrogation of the theoretical and pragmatic case for public sector engagement with the design agenda as represented in the two fundamental research questions. As such, the research will examine and critique a political accord on the importance of good design in the built environment shared by Governments since at least the mid 90s. Yet this has been an agenda that has also been notoriously difficult for policy makers to frame, or through which to reliably measure a tangible impact. An in-depth examination of the diverse programmes of CABE will provide an opportunity to examine the nature of design in public policy and to gauge which types of programmes are most effective at influencing outcomes. The evidence will help shape national, local and international policy in the future. Learning the lessons to better influence design quality  Under Design Council CABE, national work on design review and some aspects of enabling will continue to be funded to the tune of £3 million a year. The devolved administrations also have their own arrangements for delivering on this agenda. Moreover, in spite of cut backs in local government, ongoing processes of design review and enabling will continue to attract many millions in public funding year on year, with all parts of England (except London) covered by a Regional design review panel, and over 50 local authorities having their own panels. Learning the lessons from the most wide-ranging experiment in methods and processes for influencing the quality of the built environment will therefore be critical to understanding the impact of these services and maximising their effectiveness in the future. In the context of the localism agenda which aims to empower community groups to prepare neighbourhood plans, the lessons will be all the more relevant. Extending the knowledge to related fields As well as a direct impact in the field covered by this research, the lessons from CABE have the potential to influence practice in a range of allied areas where similar processes of evidence, publicity, information sharing, guidance, improvement tools, assistance, monitoring, persuading, coalition building, education, and qualitative evaluation are underway. These include the heritage area, regeneration, evaluation of lottery / charity projects, architectural competitions, major infrastructure assessments, and other design-related programmes, such as those elsewhere in the Design Council. Building on the Bishop Review In 2011 the quick-fire Bishop Review was published, launched to efficiently scope the field and establish a strategic direction for Design Council CABE. Its recommendations cover the future potential of Design Council CABE and go far beyond. A compelling case is made, for example, to build a much stronger and longer-term research agenda in this field. The current proposal responds to that recommendation and in a more fundamental manner will continue the investigation that the Bishop Review began.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FJ013706%2F1

While VR brings with it the image of experiencing virtual worlds through 3D headset displays, the actual use of such displays can be physically disorienting and socially isolating. Immersive audiovisual experiences can be created in public space and in performance by the seamless projection of data, graphics, and video on all surfaces of a performance space, and by the use of multichannel surround sound. Immersion can take place in real space and be shared with others as an embodied collective experience. Goldsmiths' Sonics Immersive Media Labs (SIML) is part of an international network of immersive projection venues including rectangular surround video facilities like the RML CineChamber (San Francisco), domes such as the SATosphere (Montreal), or new formats such as the ISM Hexadome (Berlin). Whilst these facilities exist around the world, there has yet to be established a standard working method for the creation of new cultural works for them. Artists find themselves dedicating an inordinate proportion of their creative time understanding how to configure their work to fit an immersive space, often reinventing the wheel. Once a work has premiered, they find it difficult to tour it out of lack of compatibility across these venues, resulting in inadvertently site-specific work.  We are experiencing a teething period in immersive media not dissimilar to the early days of cinema, before a lingua franca of authoring method and technical process was established. The Immersive Pipeline project will partner with these leading cultural sector institutions above, as well as with immersive technology companies Derivative and NSC Creative, to form a partnership to design and develop an artist-facing immersive media production workflow. The project will engage with artists, scientists, presentation venues, and technology companies in participatory design sessions to define best practice for creative immersive media production. We will produce an immersive content authoring pipeline and make it available to artists as a method and process with which to create new works for multiscreen spaces. By partnering with the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, the project will demonstrate the pertinence of artistic immersive visualization and sonification in the health and medical sector.  Finally, we will work with our partner venues to define the specification for, and prototype, a translation and format conversion technology allowing work created for one venue (for example a dome) to be automatically translated for projection in another (a rectangular venue). The results of the project will:  1.) Empower artists to produce works for a range of immersive venues,  2.) Advance the state of the art of projection mapping technology,  3.) Bring together a diverse group of cultural institutions through shared vision and technical interoperability, and  4.) Bootstrap an international consortium for future large research projects.  The results of the Immersive Pipeline project will be showcased in a public performance/screening event.","As a pilot project, the impact of the 6 month project will be preliminary and indicative. As the artist and cultural venue beneficiaries described above gain the knowledge to produce and present work for immersive spaces, the potential for broader impact on industry and culture will become apparent. This includes impact in mainstream cinema, responding to interest expressed by large organisations like the British Film Institute (BFI) and industry companies like IMAX (https://www.wired.com/2017/01/imax-vr-theaters/). This has the potential to trigger a sequence of impact from practitioner and industry bodies leading to influencing policy at the governmental level. This upward arch starts with Immerse UK (www.immerseuk.org), followed by the Creative Industries Federation (https://www.creativeindustriesfederation.com/) to future policy briefs following on from NESTA's 2016 report, ""The Geography of Creativity in the UK"" and fulfillingthe creative economy elements in HM Government's 2017 green paper, ""Building our Industrial Strategy.""  Our work with the EGA Institute for Women's Health's Sonic Womb project will have an impact in society beyond the academic benefits described in the previous section, and point out the potential for immersive audiovisual projection to aid in the public communication of science leading to greater public understanding of health and well being.  A specific process of identifying and fulfilling impact is described in the Pathways to Impact section.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR010145%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The rise of disinformation about politics and public affairs represents an existential threat to democratic governance in many countries. After all, democracy rests on citizens having access to accurate and reliable information sources in order to make judgments about how they should be governed. But over recent years public trust in the news has declined and the legitimacy of journalism has been undermined. In collaboration with leading public service media (BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5) and a commercial news organisation (Sky News), this project will develop the most in-depth UK comparative study to date that analyses disinformation reporting and critically examines how news users respond to it. By working collaboratively with senior editors to identify where TV, online and social media platforms can more effectively counter disinformation and communicate this reporting, the aim of the project will be to enhance journalistic legitimacy in ways that better serve the democratic needs of citizens. From state interference in other countries' election campaigns to the emergent influence of populist political candidates, parties and movements, the infrastructure of today's media and communication environment has opened up new ways of manipulating and disrupting flows of information. As a consequence terms such as 'post-truth politics' or 'fake news' have become synonymous with the changing political environment, the growing supply of dubious disinformation and a crisis in the legitimacy of contemporary journalism. Whether teenage Macedonians inventing 'news' in order to influence the US elections or the Ukrainian government falsely declaring a journalist had been killed by Russian forces, the source of disinformation can range widely from democratic states entering into diplomatic games to private citizens acting duplicitously or for financial gain. While citizens may have been exposed to disinformation online, whether from a story being shared on Facebook or liked on Twitter, most - as research has shown - will be more likely to encounter disinformation from mainstream media organisations, such as the BBC. This is because legacy media remain the most widely consumed and influential information sources, with news produced by public service media often singled out for being the most trusted in representative UK surveys. However, the rise of partisan news and disinformation across online and social media platforms has created echo chambers and filter bubbles that are increasingly undermining the legitimacy of news produced by public service media. In order to ensure public service media are viewed as a credible news source into the 21st century, it is essential that their disinformation reporting addresses the needs of citizens in a fast-changing media ecology. The project will interview senior editorial staff at leading public service media and Sky News in the UK, develop an in-depth content analysis of their news across TV, online and social media, and carry out 18 focus groups with news users. The aim of the study will be to find editorial solutions to countering disinformation in routine reporting, identifying the ways in which the legitimacy of journalism can be enhanced according to news users. From state propaganda to dubious claims made by politicians, our project will assess how such disinformation can be more effectively challenged and communicated in ways that reinforce and promote journalistic legitimacy among citizens. We will work closely with broadcasters to understand their disinformation reporting and discuss whether it is viewed as legitimate journalism by news users. The project's findings will be promoted widely across our university networks and in popular media, and we will engage with relevant stakeholders, such as journalists, regulators, politicians, policy makers and citizens, through public and private meetings and events.","The main impact objective of this proposal is to enhance journalistic legitimacy by working with senior editors and regulators at leading public service and commercial news media to enhance disinformation reporting and, ultimately, raise public knowledge and understanding of public affairs.  Specifically, the project will: - Provide a means for broadcasters and regulators to understand the effectiveness of routine disinformation reporting.  - Support the reflective process that will make disinformation reporting much more effective. In the longer term, the project will help broadcast news retain and enhance its legitimacy according to news users, and more broadly ensure public service media remain an authoritative and trusted source of news in years to come. At present, there is limited collaborative research that directly works with senior editors to counter the growing mistrust of news media. This has potentially huge implications for the health of democracy, since the news media represent the primary source of information most people rely on to understand what is happening in the world. Our project offers a vital way of developing a collaborative relationship with the news industry that can build the necessary evidence base and support a way forward for engendering greater legitimacy in journalism produced by leading UK news organisations. By developing a constructive relationship with news organisations, the research will impact on future editorial judgements about disinformation conventions and practices. The responses among news users in the focus groups, for example, could make editors rethink how their journalism can be rethought in ways that serve news users more effectively. When we discuss the findings with the editorial teams of each media organisation, we will encourage them to critically re-examine their disinformation initiatives, changing their editorial codes, practices and conventions in ways that will enhance public legitimacy in news reporting.  By engaging with Ofcom and the BBC's unitary board, another aim of the project is to raise editorial standards in news reporting and inform policy recommendations about media regulation. So, for example, if our research established that BBC news output had not accurately informed viewers about a particular issue or that many focus groups members were requesting more robust fact checking in flagship programmes this evidence could inform BBC's unitary broad and lead to future editorial changes at a programme level or in the BBC's editorial guidelines. Ofcom, by contrast, has a statuary role in regulating the UK's due impartiality rules so the evidence about how accurate and impartial all broadcasters are will help them form judgements about any complaints and adjudications.  By presenting research at fringe events at the Conservative and Labour party conferences and disseminating findings through other means, we aim to make evidence-based interventions into UK Parliamentary issues and international debates about news standards and media regulation. For example, in an ongoing select committee inquiry into fake news/disinformation, our findings would identify areas where news standards could be improved according to news users, such as more transparently fact checking events or issues.  The project will also aim to raise public understanding and debate about countering disinformation by writing for popular blogs about the latest research, and disseminating ideas about enhancing legitimacy in journalism across online and social media platforms. In doing so, we aim to engage a wider audience about media literacy and use that engagement in our collaborations with editors to ensure it feeds into their future editorial output that will ultimately benefit the many millions of UK users who rely on public service media for accurate and impartial journalism.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS012508%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Teaching and Learning War research network brings together EU and international researchers and stakeholders, from a range of academic disciplines and professional backgrounds, to explore young people's engagement with and receptivity to the cultural memory messages of the two world wars from an international comparative perspective. At the centenary of the First World War in the UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand young people find themselves 'front and centre' of both state-sponsored and community-level commemorations. As the two world wars fade from living memory, young people across the Commonwealth have been singled out as those who will be carrying the memory of the war forward. Early indications suggest similar emphasis will be placed on young people in the 80th and 90th anniversaries of the Second World War.  It is at this juncture, as the commemorative focus in Britain and the Commonwealth shifts from the First to the Second World War, that new questions arise about 1) the ways these cataclysmic events are taught in the 21st century, 2) what cultural memory messages feature in education, and 3) how young people respond to and interpret these messages. While study of memory and war remembrance has intensified in recent years, the way young people engage with the cultural messages about these seminal historical events is largely unexplored. Interrogating the practices of teaching and learning about war remembrance has the potential to illuminate how memories of war are shaped. As Roediger and Wertsch identify, education is one of the 'core disciplines for a new field of memory studies' since 'many of the almost unconscious attitudes that students have about the past' are traceable to elements of 'the educational process'. The two world wars - as crucial moments of crisis where the 'British world' came together as a larger community of common interest - remain significant features of the curriculum, both formal and informal, in Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. At the same time, they raise important questions about the teaching of the history of the British Empire, an area of heated contemporary debate across the Commonwealth. These four case studies share a narrative of white, imperial masculinity and sacrifice for Empire largely compatible with the rise of a sense of national identity, thus allowing for coherent enquiry. However, the distinctiveness (or otherwise) of these case studies needs to be held up against the experiences of indigenous peoples in these white settler colonies as well as the experience of non-white colonies in these conflicts such as Kenya, Jamaica or India. To enable us to develop a larger research project on this theme, networking events will centre on four main questions: 1. How do young people think about the past?  2. How have indigenous and/or ethnic minority histories been integrated into the representation and teaching of the two world wars?  3. What role does empathy play in the teaching of the two world wars?  4. How does youth-centered commemorative activity compare across the British world? This research network is distinctive because of the disciplinary boundaries it seeks to break down, particularly between history, memory studies, education and literary studies; its focus on the memory and representation of the two world wars from a comparative perspective; and because of the ways it will foster international collaboration and the development of strong links with overseas researchers and professional stakeholders, particularly in the education sector. It capitalises on and consolidates informal links between a number of existing networks including AHRC-funded projects; IWM; UCL IoE Centre for Holocaust Education; First World War Centenary Battlefield Tours Programme; British Empire at War Research Group; Centre for Research in Memory, Narrative and Histories; Youth Research Group; and Cultural Exchange in a Time of Global Conflict project.","Direct beneficiaries: a. Teaching professionals in the secondary sector engaged in teaching the two world wars and the British Empire through history, literature or film. b. Museum educators and curators engaged in communicating their holdings on these historical events to young audiences. c. Organisations directly involved in youth-centered commemorative activity of the First World War and those considering the forthcoming Second World War anniversaries.  d. Young people in secondary education studying the two world wars and the British Empire. Indirect beneficiaries: e. Educational policy makers and exam boards. f. Professional organisations developing programmes of CPD. g. Members of the media considering ways to learn from the FWW centenary in anticipation of the major anniversaries of the Second World War. The overarching objective is to open up discussion and dialogue between key academic and non-academic stakeholders around the theme of young people's engagement with and receptivity to the cultural memory messages of the two world wars and the British Empire. Specific impact objectives are: 1. Developing our understanding of working with young people in the co-production of research and heritage projects (Events 1 and 4) 2. Reflecting on the centenary commemorations of the First World War centenary in anticipation of the major anniversaries of the Second World War with specific focus on media and educational outputs (Events 2 and 4) 3. Interrogating the scope and usefulness of using literary texts for children and young adults to enhance learning about war and war remembrance (Event 3) The success of this research network relies on close collaboration with secondary school teaching professionals, professional organisations (English Association, Historical Association and History Teachers' Association Australia), young people in secondary education in Britain and the Commonwealth, official government representatives of commemoration, representatives and community workers from the museum and heritage sectors, and members of the media. Each event has been carefully configured to ensure representatives from all these sectors will have the chance to engage with the project, contribute to discussion, review and discuss findings from these discussions, and recommend changes to teaching policy and commemorative practice on the basis of our findings. Our research network is unique in the way it has specifically carved out space for young people to share their insights and critical reflections on commemoration thus inviting them to question engrained 'truths' and to take an active role in shaping commemoration, rather than just be told what is 'right'. Our close collaboration with the English Association means that our findings will almost immediately inform professional practice through the publication of a special edition of Issues in English. Similarly, our findings will be disseminated directly to history teaching professionals via the Historical Association's magazine, Teaching History. As a result, the research network will have influence on the CPD programmes that both organisations produce and regularly review for professionals in their sector. The podcast (Event 2) and PDF policy report will also act as important freely available springboards for those involved in commemoration and media production reflecting on their practice between the period 2014-18 as they move towards the major anniversaries of the Second World War. Both PI Pennell and Co-I Sheehan have extensive experience of working co-operatively with the non-academic stakeholders involved in this bid from previous externally funded projects and public engagement activity (teachers, professional teaching associations, official government centenary projects, community commemorative projects, and the media) and understand the best ways to facilitate dialogue and meaningful exchange around this shared agenda.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP014518%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Summary The overall aim of the present project is to offer a way for school-children, students and interested members of the public to engage with a number of facets of Britain's medieval past, its language, manuscripts, and the clothing worn by the royal family and nobility. Specifically, the proposal is to offer an attractive and accessible entry point to the resources of the project Lexis of Cloth and Clothing in Britain c. 700-1450: origins, identifications, context and change (LexP). This was a major five-year research project that received funding from the AHRC in 2006 for a trans-disciplinary study with the purpose of collecting together the terms for medieval dress and textiles in use in the British Isles across the Middle Ages in the form of a searchable database, illustrated by images of clothing from manuscript art and statues. A new entry point into the LexP will be provided through a website which will include brief descriptions and summaries of manuscripts of the Royal Wardrobe accounts for the reigns of Edward I, Edward II and Edward III. These are documents which record the textiles bought to make the clothing (manufactured in Britain or imported) and the garments that were made out of them, together with the costs and the payments to tailors, embroiderers, button-makers, etc. The summaries will be accompanied by an index to all words for cloth and clothing in the accounts and information about these words will be provided via links to the LexP database. There will also be links to records of cloth and clothing in Discovery, The National Archives' catalogue. The new project's website will also feature images of the manuscripts held in The National Archives so people can see the handwriting and gain a sense of the look of these medieval documents. In addition, the website will include an artist's impressions of the clothing described in the Royal Wardrobe accounts and images of the royal family, to compare the clothes worn by modern royals for state occasions with those worn in the Middle Ages. A further aim of the project is to produce a guide to the clothing and textiles in the records held at The National Archives. This treasure store of manuscripts is freely available to the public, but again, an entry point is needed to make the information contained in the manuscripts accessible and to instil a sense of ownership in this heritage.","Impact Summary The project aims to offer a way for school-children, students and the general public to engage with various facets of British heritage: its language, the documents of its medieval past, and the history of what the royal family wore for state occasions as well as who made the clothes and where the fabrics came from (manufactured domestically or imported). The project thus offers an accessible entry point to engagement with medieval documents and the original languages in which they were written.  For many pupils, their encounter with the project will be enhanced by visits to their schools by members of the project team who will introduce them to the materials and set projects and activities which will follow up on their encounter with medieval manuscripts and handwriting. It is hoped that this will offer them a new way into the world of history and of books and, it is hoped in some cases, to visits to The National Archives to see the manuscripts for themselves: they may attend the exhibition at The National Archives or go on school outings. There is evident public interest in the clothing and documentation about it that remain to us from Britain's medieval past, and these has proved a source of inspiration for artists, for example, the fashion designer, Juliana Sissons, whose residency at the Victoria and Albert's medieval and renaissance galleries resulted in her 2011 collection of knitted pieces inspired by the armour collection and images depicting armour in tapestries and sculpture. At present, the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library is drawing record numbers - around 800 per day - and the artist Cornelia Parker will unveil a new work inspired by the Magna Carta in May 2015. The summaries of the Royal Wardrobe accounts and the artist's impressions on our project website will spur investigation into the documents and the sources of the words for the garments worn in medieval Britain.   There is a public appetite for information about the history of the English language and its vocabulary. The Lexis of Cloth and Clothing in Britain offers information about these and many other questions about the vocabulary of cloth and clothing in medieval Britain. It is also the first (only?) multilingual dictionary resource and offers its users an insight into the multilingual situation in medieval Britain which is still not part of the story of the history of English told in most standard textbooks on the subject.  Historical Re-Enactment and Living History groups represent a worldwide movement. They include costume-makers who regularly make use of academic resources to ensure that the clothes worn by medieval characters are as accurate as possible. They are frequently hired by film, theatre and television producers as well as museum curators. The project's website will offer an accessible way in to the resources of the LexP which include a gallery of images from medieval manuscripts and art in addition to the database and to those of The National Archives. A further aim of the project is to produce a guide on clothing and textiles in the records held at The National Archives, and The National Archives' Discovery catalogue will also be linked to the new project, and thus to LexP. The National Archives' holdings are free to visit: it is hoped that the project will help to make them seem more accessible and foster a sense of ownership in them in addition to the enhancement to the catalogues. The RA employed on the project will receive training and gain experience of creating and maintaining a website; s/he will write blog posts aimed at the general public and so, under the guidance of the PI, will acquire the skill of turning academic research into accessible and user-friendly, informative prose. Additionally, research on the Royal Wardrobe accounts will undoubtedly form the basis of future research in palaeography, codicology, lexis or cultural history, depending on the interests of the RA.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003357%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Throughout the past two centuries, Britons have experienced personal and collective tragedies involving burns and scalds, which have been connected to British culture and society and rooted in the habits and design of home, workplace, war and play. This project will investigate how burns have shaped identity: individual, urban and group. In 19th-century Britain, the mortality rate for burns injuries was 50%. Between 1900 and 1950, of an annual 100,000 burnt and scalded people, 20-30,000 were admitted to hospital; 2,000 died - over half were children. Today, burns injuries make up 175,000 of all A&E visits. There are 16,000 hospitalisations; 300 (2%) die. On the surface, this is a story of progress, yet in some ways this is just skin deep. Unlike other aspects of public health, there has been little progress in burns prevention. According to burns pioneer Dr Leonard Colebrook in 1950, these statistics reflected peculiarly British practices: tea drinking, open fires in homes, and widespread use of inflammable, raised-nap cottons. Not only is meaning attributed to the causes, but the material culture of burns, from changing fuels to the resultant technologies that shape how we live, is also tied into what being modern meant at key moments in the wider chronology of British history. For emergency services, emerging hazards meant pooling information and devising countermeasures, informing the design and construction of new, safer homes and workplaces - this project will examine how these decisions were reached.  While burns incidents have influenced the professionalisation of ambulance and fire services, little is known about their roles in co-ordinating life-saving and treatment. Moreover, given that many ambulance services evolved out of municipal fire brigades in the early 20th century (including our three cities), both services are ripe for comparative scrutiny to better understand their joint roles as first responders to emergencies. Alongside this, priorities around treatment have shifted from resuscitation and isolation in the 1840s, when the first 'burns unit' was established in Edinburgh (1845), to infection control and shock prevention in the 1890s, and reconstruction in the 1940s, each shift introducing new specialists to burns teams. Gradually, as mortality rates began to fall noticeably after the Second World War, the ultimate goal of burns practitioners also changed from survival to full rehabilitation and psychological recovery. Despite this progress, burns remain a visually distinct, sensually assaulting and emotionally overwhelming injury, with significant effects on mobility, the self and identity. They also have a significant bearing on psychological wellbeing, not only of the injured, but those involved in fire rescue and burns treatment. Burns are felt to be horrific and iconic. Self-immolation in particular jars our collective and emotional response, but might also inspire people. In 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest at police treatment in Tunisia. In doing so, he has been said to be the human spark for the Arab Spring and its darker wake. Indeed, rarely are burns just individual tragedies. They can galvanise collective action, as they did following the 1981 New Cross fire, which claimed 13 young lives and is recognised as having helped create a Black British identity. The 1987 King's Cross fire was the first fatal fire on London underground, and killed 31 people and injured 100. It transformed health and safety regulations in London's transport network and led to the founding of the Healing Foundation (1999), a charity working for people who have sustained burns injuries. The recent establishment of support groups suggests a more collective and consoling experience of burns, yet our cultural image of the 'burns victim' remains that of a solitary, tragic, and mysterious figure - of Miss Haversham and spontaneous human combustion.","The research subject uniquely ensures a humanities project that will benefit groups beyond academia. Through our varied and non-academic outputs, 'Forged by Fire' offers a wide reach, impacting on the work of policy makers, fire services, burns physicians, third-sector groups, former patients and their families, schools and workplaces, and the wider public. The team is uniquely placed to deliver genuine impact for a history of burns project. The PI has made close links with the Burns Collective, a newly-established national burns initiative linking units in Birmingham, Bristol and UCL, funded by the Healing Foundation. The CI will use his connections with the fire and rescue service via service associations, charities and heritage groups. More importantly, these links will enable people in these organisations to create their own histories, through oral histories organised and supported by the project team, which has ties with the Oral History Society. Interviews will be deposited with the British Library and local archives, and offers a resource for professional training. These diverse narratives, evidencing experience, have a place in the recovery process employed by group therapy. Other than in behavioural and mental health circles, this technique is unusual, with patients with burns injuries from the 1940s only the second such grouping organised into collective therapy. Group support and patient narratives continue to be used by patient organisations and evolve; a process which, through our links with Changing Faces, we will develop by offering to share at meetings, relaying historical narratives which capture the diversity of experiences. Free public exhibitions are part of our core impact strategy and rely on RF1's curating experience. An exhibition, based on 1000 photo essays (dated 1940s-80s) of the material culture surrounding individual burns events, will visit Glasgow, Birmingham and London. It is our aim that the exhibition will not only develop links between the academic sector and our planned venues (The Library of Birmingham, London Fire Brigade Museum, and the Mitchell Library, Glasgow), but also contribute to their profile and community importance. Furthermore, select and suitable material from the exhibition, as well as other project material, will be displayed at annual pop-up events organised by our home institutions to connect them with their neighbourhoods. In addition to embedding impact locally in the urban centres that form our case studies, our exhibition strategy will do the same in Leeds. The project can also make a sustained difference to prevention strategies, potentially feeding through to national policy. The research will consider the ways in which burns knowledge evolved historically, through literature, newspapers, court records, and prevention and first-aid activities. Some innovative prevention strategies remain dormant because it is assumed we inhabit similar, modern homes, but given the diversity of housing stock in our three chosen cities; the project offers to inform and develop new prevention initiatives. Through our established and developing associations with local fire services these refreshed strategies will reach schoolchildren and workplaces. Project members will offer talks tailored sensitively to each audience. Fire prevention and basic first aid activities - building on our proven record of medical simulations created by MESH's former public-outreach officer Julia Hyland - will aim to engage such groups with the experience and treatment of burns in their own communities. We will commission Birmingham artist Sarah Silverwood Taylor to produce a graphic novel reconstructing and anonymising 4-6 stories from across the two centuries. The publication, as well as postcards and posters based on its illustrations, will be distributed through our fire service partners, primarily in schools in our three cities, and material will also be made available for digital download.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN00664X%2F1

It will provide a flexible series of networked spaces in which information exchange, experimentation, collaboration, and data delivery and examination is encouraged, in order to further research goals both within the University of Edinburgh and beyond.  Within the University, the CultureLab approach will allow the Library and University Collections Division's Centre for Research Collections (CRC) to develop deeper links with academic partners in the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences wide array of schools, including the Edinburgh College of Art, the School of Language, Literatures and Culture, the School of History, Classics and Archaeology, and the Centre for Data, Culture and Society. Additionally, Edinburgh has positioned itself as the ""Data Capital of Europe"" through data-driven innovation. The University of Edinburgh's unique CultureLab approach to placing our collections at the heart of these conversations will not only allow us to more richly explore our past, but also position us to influence a future where data-driven research finds natural intersections with our shared cultural heritage. Conservation will be at the core of the CultureLab, in order to ensure the preservation, conservation and restoration of those materials maintained for the use of the educational and research community the library serves. The spaces will not only offer enhanced capability to carry out this work but also a range of upgraded equipment that will increase the scope of techniques available. In terms of resources, the Culture Lab will be equipped with resources that will enable material analysis of collections, through the use of Raman spectroscopy and additional mapping for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy to probe the chemical composition of materials, as well as a range of 3D scanning tools, including a robotic arm for large scale items, to enhance documentation, metrology, understanding of construction, and object manipulation and access. Finally, the introduction of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) for multispectral imaging will enable interactive raking light imaging for detailed research and surface modelling of a range of collections materials.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV012339%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Every day, as we use language, we unconsciously select forms of words that feel ""right"" for what we want to say. Occasionally, however, multiple forms may compete for a slot, such as the participle of 'prove' (have proved? have proven?); here, users find both forms adequate, although each of us might only use one of them. Elsewhere, we lack a suitable form where one is expected: we may baulk at forming the past tense of the verb 'troubleshoot', where we have a ""slot"" (past tense of a particular word) but no form that can adequately fill it (troubleshot? troubleshooted?). These examples of ""feast"" (multiple forms) and ""famine"" (no forms) show that selecting the ""right"" word form is not a process of mechanically mapping from function to form; instead, users weigh and select forms from a basket of those available to us, sometimes keeping around more forms than necessary and sometimes failing to find a form that works for us.  Linguists term the first sort of mismatch 'overabundance', and the second sort 'defectivity'. These mismatches cause difficulty for traditional linguistic theories, which assume that each form we use fulfils one function, and that each function can be fulfilled by one form. For the most part, this is true: if adult native speakers need a past tense of the verb 'choose', they head unerringly for 'chose', never *choosed or *chost. This results in an assumption that inflection (form-selection) is automatic, judgement-free, and innate rather than learned. Language handbooks then write this assumption into practice, describing forms and features very differently from how a speaker might actually use them.  Defectivity and overabundance have traditionally been treated as separate phenomena, arising in different circumstances that explain their divergent outcomes. Our project highlights the commonalities in these circumstances - it is the outcomes (multiple forms or none) that mark them as distinct. Using data from morphologically complex languages - Czech, Croatian, Estonian and a further language chosen by the PDRA - we explore a fundamental question: which factors push users and models of use down one or the other path? We converge on an answer by considering multiple perspectives:  - The Czech National Corpus Institute will use CORPUS DATA, particularly from more ""naturalistic"" subtitle corpora, to uncover new methods for identifying competition (overabundance) and gaps (defectivity) in the ""real world"" of texts: their methods (collocation, keymorph analysis, frequency distribution) will be refined, elaborated and tested on project languages via experimental and computational methods.  - Sheffield will use EXPERIMENTAL DATA from adult native speakers to examine language users' reactions to overabundance and defectivity by confronting them in similarly structured tests - which show in what way our reactions are (or are not) measurably different to these two slot types. These data will also help assess aspects of SOCIOLINGUISTIC VARIATION, such as education and reading skills.  - York will test, refine and develop COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY to see how they handle and predict overabundant and defective slots.  - Zagreb and York will collect LANGUAGE ACQUISITION DATA in naturalistic and experimental settings to illuminate how learners make sense of ""messy"" data such as those found in overabundant and defective slots. Overabundance and defectivity will be examined as potentially differing, temporary responses to structures of uncertain predictability.  As an integral part of the project, staff in Zagreb and Prague will translate our findings into GUIDELINES for language users, feeding directly into public-facing language resources such as online dictionaries and handbooks of the target languages. Instead of seeing idealised systems that linguists project for them, as at present, speakers will get information on how their language is used in a clear and user-friendly format.","The Feast and Famine project has a clear path to impact in the real world, using advances in linguistic theory to address issues in ordinary language use. It will bring immediate benefits for authors of language resources, and longer-term benefits for those who use written language in their daily lives. By writing reference works about language, scholars exert pressure on the form of a 'standard' language, shaping it to their descriptions. Ideally, these descriptions are based on actual usage, but in practice, they are often based on an author's gut feelings, combined with material inherited from existing handbooks. Our project deals with the forms of words (morphology), and specifically what happens when we find more than one suitable form (e.g. I have proved/proven my point) or have difficulty finding any (e.g. I have already ?troubleshot/?troubleshooted this problem). Especially in languages with more elaborate verb and noun paradigms than English, at every turn we encounter the question: is there really one ""right"" form? Or should we describe things differently when we write a grammar or dictionary of this language? Feast and Famine addresses this question on several fronts: mapping the extent of these possibilities in four languages; incorporating project outcomes in two major public resources; and developing protocols for expressing and managing this variation in public-facing works in general. With major impact envisaged in two different language settings, it offers an unparalleled chance to learn how the linguistic setting affects these decisions and how to implement them more effectively. Two project partners, the Czech Language Institute (CLI) and the Institute for Croatian Language and Linguistics (ICLL), are the major national bodies in their respective countries that create and maintain public-facing language resources. The project outcomes thus reach an already engaged audience who trust these bodies as authorities in the field. The Czech Internet Language Handbook (ILH) at the CLI contains detailed grammatical information on word forms. It receives over 20,000 hits per day and since its launch in 2009 has been accessed from over a million unique IP addresses (in a country of 10.5 million). Staff responsible for the ILH will target places in it where gaps and competition occur and identify the commonalities, with the goal of creating a uniform, easily understandable way of explaining these places to users. This system will be rolled out to the ILH and disseminated to colleagues in other areas - e.g. those with responsibility for producing the upcoming new dictionary of Czech. The Croatian Morphological Doublets Database, administered by staff at the ICLL and the University of Zagreb, aims to contain a detailed list and description of all such forms. Project work will help complete this database, which will then serve as a resource for an upcoming handbook similar to the Czech ILH and for other reference works. Our work on Croatian child language has significant potential to influence how we assess children's linguistic development. A dissemination workshop will guide potential stakeholders - in publishing houses, education and at the ICLL itself - to access and use our research's practical results. In Estonia, we plan outreach talks and meetings with bodies active in monitoring and codifying the Estonian language. We will engage with the Estonian Language Institute and the Estonian Mother Tongue Society to deliver talks and discuss our research. Similar work is envisaged for the fourth project language. All project countries have ""popular-scholarly"" journals about language (e.g. Estonia: Oma Keel; Czech Republic: Nase rec; Croatia: Hrvatski jezik), where we plan articles for the interested public. This project promises impact on a significant scale, with opportunities to learn and shape how theoretical linguistics and the public face of language interact with and inform each other.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT002859%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The chicken is native to Southeast Asia but over the last 8,000 years it has been transported by people around the world - no other livestock species is so widely established. The chicken's eastward spread from Asia to the Americas has been the subject of many studies; however, its diffusion to the West has received much less attention. There have been a few small-scale surveys documenting the spread of chickens across Europe but there has been no comprehensive review about the rapidity of the spread and its cultural and environmental impacts. No ancient (and little modern) DNA work has been published for European chickens, nor have there been any isotopic studies focussed specifically upon their diets or whether they were bred locally or traded. Given the social and cultural significance of this species (whether as a provider of meat, eggs or feathers, its widespread use in cockfighting or its association with ritual, magic and medicine), a detailed analysis of the natural and cultural history of chickens in Europe is long overdue and this has genuine potential to provide cultural data of the highest quality and relevance for a range of disciplines and audiences. To realise this potential and elucidate the circumstances and meaning of the westward spread of the chicken from the late prehistoric period to modern times our trans-disciplinary team - composed of experts of international renown in European archaeology, anthropology, genetics, zooarchaeology, and other branches of archaeological science - will integrate the evidence from their specialist studies to answer the following questions: 1) When, how and why did domestication and the early husbandry of chicken take place in Europe? 2) How rapidly did chickens spread into different parts of Europe and how was this diffusion linked to population movements, trade or cultural changes? 3) When did poultry and egg production emerge and how intensively were chickens exploited for these products in different regions and periods? 4) When and where did modern chicken breeds develop? 5) How have chickens changed society and culture in antiquity and in modern times? 6) Can evidence from the past be used to transform modern practices of chicken management? Research will be carried out at the Universities of Bournemouth, Nottingham, Roehampton, Durham, Leicester and York to investigate these questions. This work will be supported by an interactive research network ""The Chicken Coop"" (www.chickenco-op.net) that has already been established. In addition to the Chicken Coop members, we will work with colleagues from many parts of the UK and continental Europe, who will supply information and samples for analysis. Our research will directly involve groups drawn from beyond the academic community (including schoolchildren, chicken breeders and artists), with whom we will collaborate to produce physical and virtual art exhibitions. These will complement a series of museum exhibitions 'The Chicken Trail' that, together, will tell the story of the chicken's domestication and spread across Europe.  The research will generate a large number of papers for academic journals and provide other publications and outputs aimed at a wider audience. The project aims to use the study of chickens to demonstrate how studies in the arts, humanities and sciences can be fused together for the benefit of both academic and non-academic communities. Chickens play a major role in modern European societies. This project will greatly increase our knowledge of the history of this exotic species and allow those who keep chickens to appreciate how this knowledge can be used to the benefit of the management of chickens in the present and future.","All team members, from PI to PhD students, will contribute to the Impact programme, ensuring that they not only gain skills and experience in communicating research but also appreciate how the arts and sciences can be fused creatively for social benefit. Our pilot project highlighted four groups with whom we wish to engage; they will not only benefit from the project but will be actively involved in it:  1) General public. Chickens are as much a part of Europe's cultural heritage as the more visible monuments of Stonehenge or the Coliseum but, because they are abundant and widespread, their cultural significance is overlooked. Yet it is their very familiarity that makes chickens an engaging cultural and educational resource. To communicate their importance we will commission a documentary to explain the project's findings in an accessible format. This will be made available on-line with clips incorporated into our exhibitions at institutions including the Natural History Museum (Tring), Museum of London and Fishbourne Roman Palace. These exhibitions will be connected with the art exhibition (above) to establish 'The Chicken Trail' that, together, will explain the natural/cultural history of the chicken. A tourist guide to The Chicken Trail will be available for free download via the Coop website and those of our collaborating institutions. The Chicken Trail will be launched in January 2017 to coincide with the Chinese 'Year of the Rooster'. 2) Schoolchildren. From the start, we will work with educational artist, Ben Frimet, to deliver cross-curricular activities to schools/academies nationwide. Using chickens as the focus, pupils will be taught (art) history, archaeology, environmental ethics and scientific techniques. The project's results will be used as the focus for the pupil's creative writing (re-imagining the life-history of their animals) and artwork. Artistic outputs will be uploaded to the Coop website and will form the foundation of physical art exhibitions installed within the institutions involved in the project but also in public spaces (e.g. butchers' shops and laundrettes) within inner-city London: Frimet has successfully pioneered similar exhibitions. 3) Chicken Breeders/Keepers. Today, chickens are a serious economic, environmental and ethical concern. The impact of their management is hotly debated: at the large-scale, intensive farming has been widely critiqued (e.g. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's 'Chicken Out' campaign) whereas small-scale domestic husbandry has been equally lambasted for spreading disease (The Guardian 23/05/12). Our project will provide both a philosophical review and deep-time empirical evidence to inform on these current debates. Throughout the project we will communicate our results to the world of poultry breeders via our partnership with Practical Poultry (membership 17,000) and through publication in their dedicated magazine. We will work directly with members, briefing them on the significance of chickens and providing information on the origin and genetic diversity of rare breed populations - issues key to the development of effective management strategies. Members will be asked to provide samples for analysis and encouraged to volunteer for anthropological interviews so that they might engage directly in our research. 4) Academic community. We have established Chicken Coop, an international and trans-disciplinary research hub to foster dialogue, increase knowledge transfer and facilitate collaboration between academics worldwide. All of the individuals specified on the website, and many more besides, will benefit directly from this project.

"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will put in place a new network of scholars and policy-makers who will explore innovations in theory and practice that recover the research methods of the Arts and Humanities and encourage their use by Political Scientists, Area Studies scholars and policy-makers in the UK and beyond. The network will investigate examples of blurring genres, or crossing boundaries, between the disciplines in pursuit of insight into making and remaking theory, policy and practice in modern government. It will consider the practicalities of government policy-making in the United Kingdom, and beyond, seeking to apply the insights in, for example, narrative policy analysis. The network will bring together international scholars working on interpretive approaches to Political Science, with experts on Area Studies, to investigate what added value interdisciplinary research teams can bring to traditional research approaches when exploring modern governance. Particularly significant will be the study of the use of narratives and meta-narratives (narratives about narratives) for Historians, Political Scientists, Sociologists, Anthropologists and Philosophers, as well as for policy-makers. The network together will contemplate the kind of stories created, evolved and recounted in the implementation of everyday policy-making in the practice of modern government. The aim of the project will be to recover methodologies from the Arts and Humanities for the use of Political Scientists and interdisciplinary Area (or country) Studies specialists. Furthermore, the Blurring Genres Network will encourage sharing of best practice necessary to inform future policy-making and innovative scholarly work; for example, by developing narrative policy analysis. The new network will encourage interdisciplinary research between scholars in the United States, the UK, China, Australia, Canada, Brazil and elsewhere with an international and comparative approach involving policy-makers. The Blurring Genres Network will organize a research field that, to date, has been unstructured, lacking regional conferences, publications or directly relevant professional associations. It will assist scholars in the United Kingdom to lead the world in this emerging field of international and interdisciplinary research. It will bring together a number of learned societies (UK Council of Area Studies Associations, Political Studies Association UK and the Western Political Science Association USA) internationally with senior UK policy-makers which have not worked together before so creating a new, unique and practical network.","Learning will be used by - Interdisciplinary scholars (senior and junior scholars) from several countries including experts, those new to the field, & post graduate students. Scholars involved will be those with established, or emergent, interests in the research methods of the arts & humanities with particular emphasis upon the importance of narratives and the uses of storytelling. - Government Circles. The management group have well established links with government departments in the UK to facilitate excellent policy focused engagement. All three academics (Hodgett, Rhodes and Bevir) have considerable experience in writing on policy related issues in the UK & beyond. They will use established networks to achieve direct and indirect impact in the public service & further afield for improved public policy. Policy-makers from across central government and devolved institutions will be invited to take part. Participants will benefit from considering how research techniques mined from the Arts and Humanities can better inform the process of modern governance. Case studies will be used from the UK and abroad. - Think Tanks. Policy focused participants (the Institute for Government, the British Academy's Policy Centre, the British Council, What Works Centre for Well Being, Chatham House, Policy Exchange, Demos, Centre for Policy Studies & the Institute for Public Policy Research) will also receive invitations to engage in knowledge exchange on process & practice to some events.  - Commercial Research Organisations McKinsey & Company and Price Waterhouse Coopers will be invited to participate in an event. This audience has potential for outstanding impact. The knowledge created & shared among this influential group will have significance across research on a wide range of public life (public, private and voluntary sectors). This will impact upon individuals, organisations and communities beyond the academy in the social, economic, political & arts domains. Information gleaned through this network should serve to increase the effectiveness of public policy & service provision longer term. It will also have influence across many aspects of national life so contributing to the wider public benefit. We therefore expect that impact might include:- 1. Informing central government departments on academic practice through Civil Service Learning, sharing experience of interpretive approaches to policy development. 2. Informing devolved departments on practice, sharing knowledge of regional & cultural difference, & new developments in policy innovation. 3. Capitalizing on knowledge exchange between the academy & government departments through discussions with those likely to be impacted by policy interventions.  4. Concentrating on mining ideas from the Arts & Humanities in potential research networks between the academy, government & policy related think tanks including, for example, the Institute for Government, the British Academy's Policy Centre, the British Council, What Works Well Being Centre, Chatham House, Policy Exchange, Demos, Centre for Policy Studies & the Institute for Public Policy Research.  5. Reaching out to members of the academy not yet engaged in work on methodology including, for example, the UK Council for Area Studies (representing 23 learned societies http://www.ukcasa.ac.uk/ ) & running an event in conjunction with members. This may provide opportunities to collaborate with the government and media. 6. Engaging with the media to publicize our work including, for example, BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, Thinking Allowed & Sunday. Project leaders already have established connections to the BBC. 7. Senior AHRC, ESRC, RCUK, REF and HEFCE officials will also be invited to take part.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN006712%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Historical musicologists are now paying greater attention to the geographical contexts in which past performances took place. Fuelled by the increasing accessibility of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, they can now also visualize and analyse complicated trends across time and place with greater ease than ever before. Building on work in contemporary music studies and urban sound studies, this network will ask what is at stake in turning to maps as objects and methods in music history and heritage. These questions are not merely methodological but also political. Part of the premise of this network is that cartography has never been innocent or neutral. Given that more and more musicologists are plotting their findings onto two-dimensional representations of the world, it is vital to establish a critical forum for the mapping of the musical practice - past, present and future. The network will take the form of four meetings bringing together participants from across disciplines (musicology, literature, theatre, architecture, geography, heritage, urban studies, digital humanities) and sectors (academic research, archives and museums, arts consultancy and urban planning). Newcastle University will host the first and largest meeting (c. 35 people), which will take stock of current work across the range of disciplines and professions represented in the network. Liverpool University will host the second, smaller meeting (c. 20 people), which will focus on heritage and tourism as contexts for mapping music history. Harvard University will host the third meeting (also c. 20 people), which will focus on music and colonial mapping in the long nineteenth century. The Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London will host the final meeting (again c. 20 people), which will focus on sound and urbanism as contexts for mapping music history.","The research network has four pathways to impact. The first two involve web resources for the general public, the second two involve engagement with professional stakeholders. 1. Developing a new project site to advertise network meetings, record presentations, and disseminate early findings The network will have a website with the domain name research.ncl.ac.uk/mappingmusichistory allowing open access to research activities. This site will be hosted for free by Newcastle University throughout and beyond the duration of the network. The site will provide access to research activities and findings, a hub for communication among network participants, and an archive of past discussions and proposals for future research and impact. 2. Enhancing and promoting musicalgeography.org to provide an accessible and sustainable online hub for digital mapping in music history Founded by Dr Louis Epstein (Co-I) in 2016, and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, musicalgeography.org is a leading international resource for mapping music history. In only two years the site has clocked more than 30,000 page views with each individual map viewed around 100 times. After the US, the UK has the highest number of visitors. Participants in the research network will enhance the content of musicalgeography.org by adding new maps, links, and blog posts. The network will also enhance the visibility and interactivity of musicalgeography.org by promotign the site via academic and social networks. 3. Collaborating with key stakeholders in archives and museums to develop exhibition proposals on mapping and music history The network will support knowledge exchange among academics and curators in order to develop proposals for exhibitions related to mapping and music history. It will do this by involving expert participants (e.g. Map Curator of the National Library of Scotland and Digitisation Officers from the Royal College of Music Museum); arranging hands-on time with collections (e.g. the Harvard Map Collection); and workshopping exhibition ideas. The output from these discussions will be a proposal to Newcastle University's Robinson Library for an exhibition on mapping music history drawing on local archival materials. 4. Collaborating with key stakeholders in arts policy and urban planning to explore the use of historical mapping in music heritage and tourism The network will support knowledge exchange among academics and arts/planning professionals in order to develop the use of mapping in music heritage and tourism. It will do this by involving expert participants (e.g. from the British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM) and music consultancy Sound Diplomacy) and by workshopping ideas and methods for historical mapping in music heritage and tourism. Outputs from these discussions will include a briefing note for heritage organisations highlighting best practice and potential academic partners for future projects.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS006354%2F1

The Pre-Columbian societies that created and used these earthworks for habitation and agriculture left a permanent imprint on the landscape. Their domestication of these landscapes included forest islands and raised fields, and emerged in the context of crop cultivation over several thousand years. This research uses palaeoethnobotany and landscape archaeology to define the history of combined plant and landscape domestication in the Llanos de Mojos. We propose that cultivation and adoption of specific crops, such as manioc and maize, drove the domestication of these landscapes through altered fire regimes, the development of raised field agriculture and clearance of gallery forests. Forest islands were inhabited by both farmers and cultivated plants. Later, raised fields were built to improve conditions for a wide range of plants. It is suggested that raised fields added flexibility to these agricultural systems allowing more plants to be grown in more places throughout the year. Through strategic landscape sampling, a palaeoecologist from Northumbria University and archaeologists from University of Central Florida will use subsurface cores of lakes and wetlands, stratigraphic excavation of both forest island habitations and raised fields, to obtain complementary datasets that will be used to reconstruct and analyse the long-term agricultural history of the Llanos de Mojos.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS00128X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will undertake a re-examination of Irish cultural and political experience during a key period of the country's modern history - between 1879 (the commencement of the Land War) and 1939 (Eire's adoption of neutrality in World War II, and the 'end' of Modernism with the publication of Joyce's 'Finnegans Wake'). Progressing from an acknowledgement of the assumptions that have underpinned conventional models of Irish Modernism, our principal aims are: 1) to reconfigure the existing critical landscape as it is currently contested across disciplines in humanities (e.g. literature and history), the arts (e.g. fine art and music) and social sciences (e.g. sociology and politics); 2) to establish a longer-term, multi-disciplinary analysis of Irish cultural experience since the early twentieth century; 3) to disseminate our findings as widely as possible, and in ways that affect public perception of Irish cultural identity. The project is multidisciplinary in scope, drawing on current debates in a range of fields including English, History, Politics and Cultural Studies.   Contemporary opinion regards Ireland as having a unique relationship with modernity in general, and with cultural Modernism in particular. In this account, the country produced some of the principal voices of Anglophone Modernism (e.g. Yeats, Joyce, Beckett). After seven hundred years of colonisation (the story goes) Ireland was a fractured country, its culture alienated to the point of trauma. Irish society in the nineteenth century was thus already 'Modernist' - already predisposed (through its politically and economically dependent status, as well as through the experience of profoundly traumatic events such as the Great Famine of the 1840s) to the processes of alienation and decentring that would in time come to constitute the cornerstones of the international Modernist movement. This model has largely determined the trajectory of debates on subsequent Irish history. It is as a response to Modernist dislocation and fragmentation that all future developments (independence, emigration, war, scandal, etc.) come into focus. Whilst compelling, this account does not do justice to the richness or the complexity of Irish Modernism during the fervent decades after 1879. Many figures of potential importance (e.g. 'minor' writers such as Alice Milligan) as well as many ideas of potential relevance (e.g. anarchism) are routinely relegated to the margins of debate. By promoting discussion between scholars from different disciplines, Marginal Irish Modernisms will improve our understanding of how a range of ideas, practices, texts and events from a crucial period in Irish history might be considered from the perspective of Modernism, and how such a consideration might in turn enable contemporary scholars to re-interpret Modernism itself. This aim will be accomplished primarily through a series of interdisciplinary networking events involving academics with research interests in Ireland during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Key international figures will feature in each event and the attendance of new researchers and research students will be encouraged and supported. Events will be held in international locations (London, Dublin, Liverpool). It is anticipated that once established, the project will continue into new fora, including a monograph series and a dedicated journal. This major intervention in the academic field will be matched by a determination to create opportunities for wide public dissemination of research. The project will engage a range of stakeholders to advance their understanding of a key period in the formative development of Ireland and Irish identity, and to challenge ideas which have held sway for too long. Such an intervention will in turn contribute to the re-imagination of subsequent Irish history, and to the re-orientation of its current status.","By increasing the visibility of marginalised authors, texts and practices, the Marginal Irish Modernisms Network will benefit a wide range of non-academic stake-holders, especially those with an interest in culture in general, and Irish culture in particular. Potential audiences include the general reading public, library users, reading groups, Irish cultural societies and special interest groups. Through a dedicated website and public activities, these audiences will benefit from raised awareness of previously overlooked or underrated texts and authors, thus increasing their understanding of the general development of cultural / political relations across the Atlantic Archipelago and beyond. This will also help to stimulate a sense of cultural identity for Irish communities in the areas close to each of the network events. This latter point pertains especially to expatriate, multi-generational Irish audiences throughout the UK. Such communities have traditionally been regarded as removed from the well-spring of 'authentic' Irish culture. Insofar as Modernism is characterised by a focus on experiences of alienation and displacement, the Marginal Irish Modernisms Network will place the experience of emigration at the heart of this project, both in terms of its cultural representation and in terms of its social / political history. Over the past two years the Principal Investigator has worked with the 'Irish Itinerary' - administered by the European Federation of Associations and Centres of Irish Studies (EFACIS), and funded by Culture Ireland - to expand Irish cultural activities across the continent (including Belgium, France, Holland, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Scotland and Sweden). He has been commissioned for a further two tours in 2015 and 2016, covering venues in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany and Hungary. These presentations will be for a mixed audience of academics and members of the public. This is one of the ways in which an appreciation of the need for an initiative along the lines of this Network has developed. Beyond Europe, the Co-investigator has worked extensively at a number of US institutions (e.g. Universities of California and Texas), while the Principal Investigator has worked with Irish cultural groups throughout the UK (e.g. the London Irish Women's Centre and the Irish World Heritage Centre). The Network will impact upon the Irish cultural sector by enhancing public knowledge of marginalised cultural activities and raising awareness of the breadth and diversity of Irish culture in general. Beneficiaries include publishers (e.g. Penguin Ireland), festival organisers (e.g. regional Irish festivals such as London, Liverpool and Manchester), and cultural agents such as Arts Council Ireland, Culture Ireland (a major contributor to the funding of Irish culture worldwide), museums and libraries (e.g. Liverpool Central Library, the Long Room at Trinity College, Dublin). Increasing awareness of marginalised literature will increase engagement with Irish culture through the consumption of novels, poetry and plays, attendance at festivals, workshops, film screenings, and public lectures. Key changes arising from the network will be indicated by an increase in interest in specific authors or texts, increased attendance at cultural events, and a concomitant increase in discussion of authors and texts in popular media. This will be described further in the pathways to impact statement. Communities local to each of the network events will benefit from public activities designed to raise awareness of the marginalised genre as a whole, or specific authors or texts within that genre. Films of these events will be uploaded to the website, enabling access for non-local viewers. For non-Irish communities, this will enable a deeper understanding of international Irish heritage, presenting new interpretations and stimulating debate around existing beliefs relating to Irish literature.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM011364%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Web archives are an increasingly important resource for arts and humanities researchers, yet we have neither the expertise nor the tools to use them effectively. Both the data itself and the process of collection are poorly understood, and it is possible only to draw the broadest of conclusions from current analytical analysis. The proposed project will focus on deeper analysis of the dataset derived from the UK domain crawl from 1996 to 2013 (that is, when legal deposit legislation was extended to cover digital materials), totalling approximately 65 terabytes and constituting many billions of words. For the arts and humanities, this is very big data indeed. A key objective of the project will be to develop a theoretical and methodological framework within which to study this data, which will be applicable to the much larger on-going UK domain crawl, as well as in other national contexts. Researchers will work with developers at the British Library to co-produce tools which will support their requirements, testing different methods and approaches. These may include, but are not limited to, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, proximity searching, link analysis, and geo-spatial analysis. The scale and inter-connectedness of the data requires an analytical, big data approach rather than the rendering of individual web pages. A major study of the history of UK web space from 1996 to 2013, including language, file formats, the development of multimedia content, shifts in power and access, and so on, will be complemented by a series of sub-projects from a range of disciplines, for example contemporary history, literature, gender studies and material culture. Project outputs will include a suite of tools associated with the 1996-2013 dataset; a series of case studies produced by the sub-projects; an online training course for arts and humanities researchers; peer-reviewed journal articles; and a monograph on the history of the UK web during this period.","The proposed research will have a significant impact on a range of audiences and sectors, including: 1. Institutions with responsibility for web archiving and digital preservation The UK web domain dataset 1996-2013 is held by the British Library, which as of April 2013 also has responsibility for preserving data arising from a regular crawl of UK web space. This is a major extension of the BL's legal deposit role, and one which will require considerable investment in time and resource. If this work is to be of genuine value to researchers in the arts and humanities, it is vital to understand how they wish to use the web archive, both now and in the future, and the methods and tools that they will require to interrogate and represent the data effectively. This project will inform the BL's future strategy, by engaging arts and humanities researchers in the co-production of tools for analytical access to the data. It will also help curators to understand the data for which they are now responsible, and to refine their processes of collection. Arts and humanities researchers in turn will benefit from the expertise of the digital scholarship and web archive teams at the BL, and the project will also inform provision at the UK's other legal deposit libraries.  The National Archives (TNA) has responsibility for preserving UK government information published on the web, a more selective process than the wider UK domain crawl. Members of TNA staff will be invited to attend the two proposed workshops and to join the project advisory board. Arrangements for the harvesting of national web data, and provision of access to it, vary widely between countries, but many of the problems are common. Consequently, the findings of this project will feed in to international web archive and digital preservation practice internationally, and particularly within the EU. 2. Memory institutions As the web becomes an increasingly important primary source, museums, galleries and other memory institutions will face the challenge of incorporating material derived from web archives in exhibitions and other forms of public engagement (e.g. the recent British Library Propaganda exhibition made use of archived digital materials). A more accessible and well-promoted archive, with an associated body of expertise, will support the imaginative use of big web data in this context. One of the project case studies will examine material culture and approaches to exhibiting the web. 3. Government, policy-makers and charities (Local) government, charities and other public sector organisations increasingly interact with the public online, and an understanding of the nature of that interaction and the ways in which it may be analysed is potentially of enormous interest to policy-makers, e.g. in assessing levels of political engagement over time. Relevant case studies will be disseminated widely. 4. General public Much of the data contained in the UK web archive is generated by members of the public, and this project will establish a research framework which will both safeguard their interests and help them to understand the uses to which their data may be put. A series of short videos will be produced, presenting the project's objectives and findings in an accessible way, one of which will discuss the ethics of big data research. The videos will be published on the project website and via YouTube. The project findings will also be disseminated using the well-established social media presences of the Institute of Historical Research, the BL and the Oxford Internet Institute. 5. Journalists and other mainstream media-based researchers There is a substantial media interest in web-based and social media research, and this project will provide journalists with a greater understanding of the data itself and the context within which that research is conducted. This will in turn increase public understanding of both web archives and big data.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL009854%2F1

The UK Co-I will bring to the project track record of research concerning haptics and dementia and the International Co-I in technology, handcraft and wellbeing. The project will be supported by Wales' National Centre for Product Design and Research, which has extensive experience in design research and product development. This project proposes an investigation into handcraft and playfulness in relation to dementia in order to inform the development of ludic artefacts (age appropriate toys) to support the wellbeing of people with dementia (PwD). The aim is to develop innovative playful devices that amuse, distract, comfort, engage, bring joy, and promote 'in the moment' living. The proposed research is timely as it addresses the call by the World Health Organisation and the G8 Dementia Summit for international collaboration in order to address the global challenge of the ageing population. Many older people enjoy creative pursuits and leisure activities that involve making and crafting such as knitting, crochet, woodcraft and DIY etc. People with dementia may be able to continue to practice craft skills learnt earlier in life; however memory of the structure and rules of making, reliant on cognitive function, may decline. For example PwD may continue to be able to form the stitches when knitting but can no longer follow a knitting pattern; the rhythms of making, muscle memory and emotional memory systems appear to be retained despite cognitive degeneration. This investigation will examine ways in which hand use, rhythms and gestures found in traditional handcrafting activities can be used to inform the development of playful artefacts.  The intention will be to design new playful devices to amuse and stimulate people with dementia and bring them joy, fun and laughter. The research will investigate how handcrafting promotes positive emotion; identify the manual skills that are retained despite cognitive decline in PwD and examine the ways in which haptics, gesture and sensory stimulation contribute to subjective wellbeing in later life. Those in the caring professions advocate the use of children's toys and have observed the comfort they bring to people with dementia. However there is an acknowledgment by professionals of the stigma attached to PwD playing with children's toys. This is attributed to a perceived loss of dignity, mainly by relatives and friends, rather than the person with dementia themselves. Findings from the applicant's previous research indicate there is currently a need for age appropriate playful devices specifically designed for people with dementia. This project proposes inclusive participatory design research to inform the development of new kinds of playful devices. These will build bridges between craft and hobby activities that are perceived positively by society and toys that are not. Playful artefacts will be developed to support the wellbeing of those for whom life has become limited due to memory loss or cognitive impairment.  The research will investigate ways of integrating smart materials and digital technology into designs to supplement physical and material properties. It proposes to explore new ways of augmenting traditional craft activities to provide additional sensory and communication properties. This will make it possible for PwD to interact with the devices either independently or socially and provide opportunities to personalise the experience (for example by including family photographs or favourite music). By integrating electronics and sensors, designs for new types of age appropriate toys will be developed. A toolkit for designing playful devices for PwD will be proposed, based on the findings from the research, in order to inform the design community and care professionals working in the sector","The proposed research will enhance the lives of people with dementia, their families and carers and be of benefit to society as a whole. It will investigate playful activities involving hand-use and propose the development of ludic artefacts (age appropriate toys) to promote positive emotion and enhance subjective wellbeing. Impact will be realised within the funding period for those stakeholders participating in the research and over the longer term through dissemination via professional associations, networks, professional development and training. The beneficiaries will include: - People with dementia - Families, carers  - Care professionals: occupational therapists, art and hand therapists, dementia nurses - NHS medical services: doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists  - Social Care providers: Local Authorities and not for profit businesses (e.g. - Gwalia Cyf, Community Housing Cymru, REACT, BUPA etc.) - Charities (e.g. Age UK, Alzheimer's Society, Dementia Positive) This research will inform policy regarding future care for the ageing population and indicate new priorities for research and innovation. It will propose new non-pharmacological interventions, which will have economic impact by reducing government healthcare spending over the longer term. The international collaboration with FASS at the University of Technology Sydney will provide opportunity for rapid global impact through shared designs, prototypes and findings. The research will help inform and increase the effectiveness of social care policy and foster global economic performance through development of new kinds of products and services over the medium term. Beneficiaries include:  - International governments - World Health Organisation - Commonwealth governments - UK government departments: policymaking related to healthcare and older people - Regional government: informing initiatives and policy making e.g. Welsh Assembly Government: Ageing Well in Wales, and the Commissioner for Older People in Wales - Local government: informing social care provision and services for older people e.g. day centres, residential care, community centres  The research also has potential to contribute to the UK economy through the development of new designs patents and services. It will propose a toolkit for designing devices for PwD that include the use of smart materials, embedded electronics and new methods of fabrication. The research will be of interest to individuals, organisations and businesses involved in design, engineering, fabrication and materials technology including:  - Designers - Technologists - Materials scientists - The Design Council  - British Crafts Council  - Industry: electronics industry; games and toy manufacturers - Digital fabricators and mass customisation businesses - Software manufacturers - Engineers concerned with hand-use and bimanual coordination - Assistive technologies and health care product designers and manufacturers: including brain injury, stroke and rehabilitation devices Insights from the research concerning visual and tactile perception, hand-use, and manipulative skills of PwD will have the potential to inform: - Development of new products, resources and service design for older people - Architects: design for housing, public buildings and social care environments   CARIAD is committed to placing people at the heart of research and the proposed participatory project will make a difference to the SWB of PwD through their inclusion from the outset. CARIAD will support dissemination events, publication of the toolkit and website providing potential impact to occur rapidly, globally, individually and socially. Research staff will gain new transferable skills in working with new technologies and materials, design processes and requirements for designing for PwD applicable to a range of design contexts and service provision for vulnerable people with complex social needs.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM005607%2F1

It will collaborate with NGO partners and grassroots museums who work in the areas of human rights, historical memory, victim representation and memories of conflict. These organisations strive to uncover the stories of hidden, marginalised, or misrepresented cultures, social groups, and identities to capture the memories of victims of conflict, stories of non-violent resistance, community mobilisation and self-help. Working together, the project will develop and implement creative museum products, practices and activities that will support grassroots, community-based museums. The testing and implementation of these museum products, practices and activities will engage diverse audiences, and will position the public as active co-creators of museum content. The project will thus support these community organisations in their human rights work to prevent violence, and envision and build for peaceful futures. The project will also contribute to the sustainable development of the creative economy more broadly, because, following in the trends of new museology and calls to decolonise the museum and its practices, it will support community empowerment, activism, cultural expression and participation by democratising not only access to museum spaces, but also the very creation of museum content itself. Community museums are uniquely placed to document untold stories of the power of reciprocity and collectivity, of a refusal to bear arms, of a commitment to bear witness and document truths. This project seeks to acknowledge and embed such values into our academic theory and practice, by decolonising notions and norms of museums and museal products, and by empowering local experts to document, create, curate, and narrate self-directed representations of their lives and stories. In order to achieve this, the project will run 3 interlinking work packages. The first of these will support 27 grassroots and community museums across Colombia by trialling interactive, low-cost products and activities which aim to encourage the public to reflect on issues of memory, human rights, and representation in museums. The team will design a schedule for these museums to trial each product, with accompanying activities to engage audiences in practices of self-curation - that is, curating their own life experiences as a process of working through memories of the past, and aspirations for the future The second work package will work with five specific community museums or groups who are named partners on the grant. Each of these NGOs already has expertise in running museums, memory spaces, or temporary exhibitions and, working with them, we will develop activities based on co-curation, with the aim of bring in communities into the curating process, as a way of integrating multiple perspectives from local communities. Each of these five community museums or groups will take a lead on a particular aspect of this co-curation, tailored to their expertise and spaces, and will hold an exhibition showcasing the results. The third work package will be targeted at grassroots organisations that do not currently conceive of themselves as museums, but whose existing archives and resources have the capacity to be exhibited - thus building future capacity for community organisations to participate in the creative economy. Learning from work packages one and two, this work package will develop tools including a checklist, best practice guides, and an online training session to help grassroots organisations decide what elements from their existing resources would work best in a museum or exhibition space.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW006693%2F1

These conversations between academics, design SMEs and the national heritage agencies will provide opportunities to narrate accounts of how design focussed SMEs have been able or inhibited from engaging with innovation in relation to heritage, how those agencies which influence regulation and governance are engaging with design sector, and how together they understand the role and value of design in relation to heritage.  Our starting point is that while design is widely recognised in novel urban forms (buildings, public spaces etc) that meet future needs, it is less well recognised in conserving selected heritage that integrates with new and extended places. Still less attention has been given to opportunities for innovation to make the vast majority of the existing urban fabric smarter for the future. By bringing together those involved in valuing heritage and design into directed conversation, this project will not only highlight stories of success where design SMEs have been able to create value but also provide a deeper understanding of some of the constraints which hold back others from achieving such success.","Initially, the primary beneficiaries will be those partners directly involved in the project. For example, the SMEs involved will have the opportunity to become part of a cutting edge network, with access to the latest thinking in their area, as well as developing personal contacts and a wider understanding of the sector, which could help them to build research and development capacity. By exploring innovative and imaginative ways in which small design businesses are working in relation to built heritage, and by engaging a wider range of design businesses, we expect that a stronger understanding of how to support SMEs to contribute design to innovation. Co-learning across organisations and facilitated learning between sectors and actors will encourage and identify new ways in which design and innovation can be encouraged and used in relation to built heritage. Historic Scotland details its benefits in the letter of support, recognising that a dialogue of this nature will add value to their work.  Research beneficiaries will also include policy-makers (particularly those with involvement in conservation and heritage, but also more widely in stimulating design in innovation within SMEs) at national and local scale. Outcomes in this area will be specifically fed back through the wider existing networks within Historic Scotland and through the Institute for Future Cities.  The academic impacts expected include enhanced understandings of how approaches to design and creativity present in other sectors can be used in relation to built heritage and built environment, and contributions to the research agenda of the AHRC in supporting more effective engagement between academics and businesses.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013983%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Short Peace network will assemble a multi-national and multi-disciplinary group of scholars to explore the entangled political, religious, and cultural history of Europe between 1595 and 1620. This era of peace and peace-making has been largely overlooked because it is caught between two eras marked by war: the sixteenth-century 'Wars of Religion' (c.1546-1609) and the Thirty Years' War (1618-c.1648/59). This interwar period was not accidental, a mere absence of war: rather, the conditions of peace were deliberately constructed and maintained by princes, statesman and diplomats in the Low Countries, Britain, France, the Empire, the Ottoman Porte, and, above all, in Spain. These efforts were not wholly successful; for, rather than being a time of tranquility, the coming of peace inaugurated an era of confessional confusion and confrontation, instability, and terrorism. This project will be the first to begin to examine the 'Short Peace' in its own right, and as a European-scale phenomenon. Collaboration is necessary to the success of the project because the sources and expertise necessary to study the Short Peace are scattered. There are relevant national, local and familial archives in at least a dozen countries, and no single scholar can have a grasp of them all. Scholars have studied individual elements of the 'Short Peace' - the Venetian 'Interdict' controversy (1606-7), the Twelve Years' Truce (1609), the media environment of the regency of Marie de' Médicis (1610-17) - each aware that there were others scholars working on related themes elsewhere, but without the opportunity to engaging in direct conversation or collaboration. The goal of the network is to build those relationships and start those collaborations, thus laying the groundwork for a new history of the era. The network's primary activity will be a series of four workshops on themes central to the Short Peace. These include confessionalization and religious controversy; the 'Republic of Letters' and the early modern multimedia environment; conscience, conversion and allegiance; and peace-making itself. The workshops will consist of discussion of pre-circulated papers by conference participants, with invited comments; this will maximize time for idea- and information-exchange while meeting in person. The venues for the workshops have been chosen to attract participation from the widest possible group of scholars from the UK, Europe, and North America. Selected papers from the workshops will be gathered together and submitted for publication as a special issue of a journal. In addition, working with project partners and research libraries, the network will produce a resource guide for studying the Short Peace, helping identify relevant printed, manuscript, and secondary sources. This guide - produced through a pooling of expertise - will be made freely available and will support teaching and research into the era. The network will also work with the Clark Library in Los Angeles to assemble a public exhibition emphasizing the European context of late Elizabethan and Jacobean England.","The network's commitment to reconstructing a transnational context for late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Europe, and its associated impact activities, will reach non-academic beneficiaries in a number of ways. First, the creation of an analytic bibliography will involve working closely with libraries and archives to survey their relevant holdings. Conducted in partnership with the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), this survey will help participant libraries to better understand their own holdings, relationships they may have to materials held elsewhere, and the developing interests of the research community. The bibliography will also be transformed into a public-facing resource (a 'LibGuide'), which will help librarians and university teachers support teaching and learning in adjacent fields. The development of these resources will also help CLIR itself establish transnational partnerships and serve as a model for future programming. The partnership with the Clark Library involves a public-facing exhibition aimed to educate a public audience in the Los Angeles area about the European contexts behind relatively well-known events in late Elizabethan and early Stuart English history (e.g., the Essex revolt, the Gunpowder Treason, and the execution of Sir Walter Raleigh). The exhibit will increase the understanding of the history of European interconnection among visitors, as well as helping the Clark Library pursue their strategic objectives related to increasing visitor numbers and establishing a programme of public events. We will leverage the connections of network members (with, for example, the British Library) to begin conversations with other museums and libraries about hosting similar exhibitions. These activities will ensure that the research of the network will have impacts on teaching and on the practices and offerings of cultural and heritage institutions.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT004169%2F1

Positive results, widely reported (e.g.New Scientist, Autism, Research in Drama Education) led to requests for the methods to be translated into education and community contexts. Since 2014, we have delivered one off outreach workshops for professionals in education, health and social care as well as doing an arts centre residency with associated outreach activities (The Atkinson 2017). Radical reforms to education and the NHS and revised diagnostic criteria have created gaps in provision with calls for 'extra capacity' in the 'community and voluntary sector' to provide support for autistic people (Kent Autism Strategy, 2017). Imagining Autism is well placed to deliver sought after services and resources (as detailed below) through novel methods that have proven efficacy.  Applied theatre with autistic participants reports a shift from skills based approaches (e.g. using drama to model socially appropriate behaviour), to recognition of the potential of improvisation in facilitating social creativity. According to Matthew Lerner (a psychologist who has collaborated with the iA team) this is ""the emerging, novel approach to autism-which meets individuals with ASD where they are instead of trying to 'fix' them"" and is ""transforming how these individuals think of themselves in the world, and what they are capable of becoming."" The iA project is associated with this shift from a deficit to a social model of disability and creative and capability paradigms. Follow on funding will enable us to systematically respond to invitations from multi-agency groups for training and resources so that the Imagining Autism approach can reach new audiences and user communities. Funding is sought for  1. A training model for schools to embed the creative practices within the curriculum, initially at the Beacon School Training Centre in Kent. Between March and June 2018 we will adapt the approach in Kent schools via continuing professional development workshops. Teachers will be trained as 'Imagining Autism Champions', to disseminate the creative practices across the curriculum. The iA Champions will be given practical resources (see 3) as well as training and mentoring from iA practitioners who include autistic artists. 2. Autistic Community Cafés. Inspired by Dementia and Pop up Cafés, Community Cafés are events in arts centres and community venues that offer family friendly social spaces for support, information sharing, networking and activities. We will try out different iterations of the model to determine timings and content. We will also be establishing how to best involve the autistic community. This will also be the platform for refining then promoting the iA Creative Box (see below). Working with NAS community groups and in dialogue with ""Autscape"", the café events respond to needs identified by the autism community and their families for increased opportunities for social space and exchange. 3. The iA Creative Box will contain creative sensory stimuli to engage autistic children. This portable resource will contain puppets, activity cards and a DVD for use in educational and community contexts. Its development is a key part of the schools mentoring programme through user group consultation (see 1). The boxes would manufactured initially on a 'cottage industry' model but later, when we have developed the prototype, through a manufacturer. To develop the prototype, a Creative Box would be available free for the Autism Community Cafes (see 2) and local autism support groups for feedback and evaluation. Autism Re-imagined will extend the impact of iA through innovative and creative pathways for knowledge exchange in the changing contexts of autism education and support.","Who will benefit from the project? The development of the creative training model for schools, the Autistic Community Café and the Creative Box will be of benefit to a range of potential user groups: Autistic individuals Members of the 'autistic community' (this includes anyone in contact with autistic people at home or at work) Parents and carers of autistic people Educators (preschool/primary/secondary teachers/teaching assistants/educational psychologists/speech therapists) Local Education Authorities Social Services Employees in Local Education Authorities, Arts Centres, Social Services, Police and Health services (paediatricians/clinical psychologists);  Health services (paediatricians/clinical psychologists) Arts Practitioners in applied and community theatre Specific beneficiaries  15 local teachers from Kent Special Schools who will train as 'Imagining Autism Champions'. The number of children that will benefit in 2018 will be between 30 and 100 in each school as the 'iA Champions' cascade their knowledge with significantly more beneficiaries as the cascade extends.  Autistic-individuals (approx 60, 10-15 per Café) via the autistic friendly space of the Cafés, where, in keeping with the Autscape ethos 'the environment, activities, social structure, behaviour expectation and presentation topics are all designed to encourage full participation of autistic people [...]and autistic needs are taken into account in every aspect of planning (Autscape).  Parents and carers of autistic people through their engagement with the Cafes, accessing workshops, presentations, film screenings; networking with other members of the autistic community and benefiting from the practical wisdom of autistic self-advocates and the expertise of the research team. The café offers a supportive forum to share ideas, problems and solutions, demonstrate creative play and drama techniques, encourage strategies, manage behaviours, and to help connect children more deeply with their parents and carers.  How they will benefit Autistic Individuals will benefit from increased understanding of the experience of autism and opportunities for advising and developing creative structures for education, support and care. Parents and carers will benefit from increased opportunities for dialogue, collaboration and support. Educators will benefit from an approach endorsed through rigorous research and community consultation.   Local Education Authorities will benefit from inclusive training packages for inset days and short courses. Social Services will similarly benefit from effective approaches which can be used in a range of contexts (e.g. respite centres; weekend and holiday play schemes). Health Services will benefit from access to similar training packages as above but these techniques may also be adapted and developed to facilitate child friendly methods of diagnostic assessment (Hannah Newman PhD). What will be done to ensure they benefit Schools: The Beacon Training Centre is a future gateway to training in all Kent special schools via its affiliation with Kent County Council and Deputy Head Lynda Evans's membership of the specialist Community and Interactive Working Party. Autism Community: iA will work closely with our hosts to promote the Autism Community Cafes, and ensure the autistic self advocates, parents, educators and other professionals have the opportunity to attend.  Creative Box dissemination The Creative Box could provide a permanent resource for teachers and parents. The project includes consultation with autism specialists experienced in the development and dissemination of similar resources from prototype to manufacture. The scoping of this resource includes consultation about its potential to be developed as a digital resource.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR013543%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Hear us O Lord from heaven thy dwelling place: using sound and Malcolm Lowry's short stories to create a new vocabulary for re-imagining plastic-filled seas. Our seas are polluted with eight million metric tons of plastic every year and microplastics have found their way into humans through the food chain. How do we process such statistics and scenarios? How and where can we network to create new artefacts that present the problem differently? To reflect and act upon this extraordinary state, we wish to develop a cross-disciplinary network that meets at sea and produces new audio content with the clear overall aim of finding a new vocabulary for re-imagining our plastic-filled seas. We will explore what happens when a Practice-As-Research methodology brings academics and creatives together at sea to mingle with members of the public and uses the short stories of Malcolm Lowry and sound recording as catalysts to re-imagine our plastic-filled seas. We feel that this network, building upon previous Lowry research, will benefit not only those sectors involved but, through the free podcasts, be of use in educational, entertainment and artistic contexts. We are observing many students attempting to make work about plastic pollution but their references are limited and primarily visual. How can we instead use listening and a fresh set of literary references to generate new content? The research will use sound under the guidance of one of the world's leading sound recordists, Chris Watson, who has used audio to encourage us to rethink our immediate and global surrounds. His award-winning natural history work with David Attenborough has given Watson a unique insight into the relationship between the environment and sound. Malcolm Lowry was born on Merseyside in 1909 and named his collection of short maritime stories 'Hear us O Lord ...' after an Isle of Man hymn. His writing will be the catalyst for our network that will meet at sea during six crossings between Liverpool and Isle of Man. Lowry's stories presciently explore the impact of oil refineries on coasts and the significance of sea travel writing. During each 4-hour crossing, researchers will mingle with members of the public and ferry staff to record short interviews, Lowry passages and abstract sounds. Each crossing will be programmed around specific themes, outlined in Case for Support, and each journey will have professionally delivered sound recording workshops, Malcolm Lowry readings and informal participation.  We are proposing an exciting network who will meet at sea, including: The Retail Institute, liaising between the packaging industry and retailers such as Asda, Waitrose and Nestle The Art Doctors, an artists' group engaging the public in unusual contexts Bluecoat, Liverpool's centre for contemporary art and Lowry advocates through their 'Lowry Lounge' programme Mariners' Park, retirement facility on Merseyside for those with 25-years experience at sea The Band of Holy Joy, sound collage musicians/broadcasters Dr Jessica Van Horssen, expert in plastic pollution and part of eXXpedition network Merseyside Maritime Museum, National Museums Liverpool  The network will be led by visual/sound artist Dr Alan Dunn (Leeds Beckett University) and Malcolm Lowry expert and poet Dr Helen Tookey (Liverpool John Moores University) who previously collaborated on 'The Lighthouse Invites the Storm' conference, audio event, public artwork and limited edition CD.  Outputs from this new network include: 'Hear us O Lord' one-hour podcasts, 2020-22 'Hear us O Lord' two episodes of BAD PUNK by Band of Holy Joy, ResonanceFM 'The Lowry Lounge' art exhibition and live readings, Bluecoat 'Sea Galleries' digital display, Merseyside Maritime Museum 'Using Lowry and sound to tackle sea pollution' guest edited issue of 'Design Ecologies' 'Plastic at sea, with Lowry', researchers' network presentation, The Retail Institute annual seminar","Dissemination  This network ensures the participation of the public and aims to benefit non-academics by deploying contemporary and traditional media to ensure our content is known about and heard. Current statistics claim that 6m Britains tune into podcasts each week and globally an estimated 143m have accessed podcasts. After careful consideration of other formats (e.g. CDs), we feel that the free distribution around the globe for people of all ages of our sounds is best served through podcasts. As the listening figures suggest, it is a competitive market and we will need to use all our participants' relevant marketing departments and networks to maximise reach. We will work with leading podcast company aCAST and to support and promote the podcasts we will stage a series of launch events, including as part of the annual Lowry Lounges. These events will include live readings from network members, listening posts to access the podcasts, press launches and distribution of links to podcasts, co-ordinated and promoted by the host venues. Combined social media reach of investigators, LBU, Bluecoat, LJMU and associated institutions and partners is estimated at 250k. National Museums of Liverpool have agreed to present a digital exhibition about the network within the new fifteen-year 'Sea Galleries' display within their Merseyside Maritime Museum at the Royal Albert Dock, a venue that attracted 906,202 visitors in 2017/18. They will also promote the network via their website, particularly during the 175th anniversary of the Dock in 2021. Alongside historical material, the Museum is keen to be an important influence on current and future maritime issues, exemplified by its recent exhibition on contemporary slavery. These curators, engagement co-ordinators and visitors are all seen as potential beneficiaries and our network is designed to access this sector.  Beneficiaries beyond academia  We will target those with a direct relationship with the sea, from those using the ferry crossings - on average 200 per crossing - to those working in the nautical industry. Within this grouping, we include retired merchant seamen who live at Mariners' Park and while we can only invite a small number of them, we are working closely with their Events Programme Manager to ensure ongoing activities. We will target and influence policy makers, specifically using the expertise of Jessica Van Horssen and The Retail Institute who have established networks with industry and who are currently researching the impact of sensory inputs upon customers' journeys.  We will target the public by developing our relationship with the media, particularly BBC Radio, to further disseminate the content and encourage access to the podcasts. Our workshop deliverer Chris Watson has recorded regularly for BBC's Natural History Radio Unit in Bristol and Alan Dunn produced the 'SuperBlock' (2003) sci-fi radio play for BBC Radio 3 that used sound to address how a Government housing scheme impacted upon residents. Liverpool Housing Action Trust's Community Development Officer Paul Kelly reflected that 'SuperBlock was real groundbreaking work and created an open environment of engagement and involvement of our tenants, increasing their energy and profile and leading the way for more focus on artists working with communities.'  Summary of benefits beyond academia The primary benefit is the development and sharing of audio that enlightens and delivers the unexpected while combatting 'pollution fatigue.' The network will lead to members of the public:  - engaging with environmental issues while at sea - being made aware of the power of sound to reconsider our place in the world - experiencing cross-disciplinary academic research  Professionals and policy makers will be presented with alternative first-person and collaborative responses to a environmental issues that are informative, educational and entertaining.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT005289%2F1

Yet the concept, experience, and mechanics of civic pride and place attachment often remain undefined and unexamined in policy documents, practice and evaluations. Likewise, its socio-political meanings and values are at best contested and at worst unexplored or even ignored. This project will use our existing research on towns, pride and metrics to work with lead partners and a broad community of practice to creatively and collectively explore methods and metrics of civic pride and place attachment monitoring, evaluating and reporting. We understand this to be an opportunity to share the value and range of qualitative methods and metrics which can complement the more dominant econometric approaches towards culture, regeneration and local economies. The project brings academic research into conversation with national cultural bodies and local authorities to exchange knowledge regarding the correlation between place attachment (understood as the emotional bond between people and place) and the health of local cultural ecologies. The collaboration will speak directly to the need, established with our partners, for a set of co-produced evaluative metrics for understanding pride and place.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW008696%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              A vibrant and lucrative part of the global fashion industry, children's dress is also harnessed extensively in museums, schools and heritage sites to bring histories, ideas and artefacts to life. The vociferous popular debates which regularly erupt in relation to specific outfits, practices, occasions or marketing decisions indicate that children's dress today is being taken more seriously than ever before. What children wear reveals fundamental adult assumptions about what children need or deserve, as well as key insights into children's lived experiences and attitudes.  Despite this, scholars and curators to date have given little sustained attention to children's dress and to how dress is used to communicate with children in museum settings. By bringing together academics, curators and creative practitioners at a series of three workshops, this network will galvanise understanding of both clothing and childhood. The workshops will explore: 1. Communication and Usage: How can children's dress be interpreted in fresh ways and used to stimulate creativity in museum and heritage settings? 2. Agency and Intergenerational Control: Across time, what have been the power dynamics between children and adults in relation to dress? 3. Creativity and Play: How can different dress-based practices enable children's self-expression and individuation? This network has a distinctive focus on the relationship between children's clothing, design, agency and creativity, moving beyond the socio-historical evidence provided by children's dress. It not only brings together UK-based and international scholars from a range of disciplinary backgrounds (including art and design, history, law, literary studies, sociology, and theatre and performance) with expertise in childhood and/or dress, but also seeks to foster dialogue between university researchers, museum professionals and artists in order to forge new methodologies. Network participants will explore childhood and dress in relation to a range of concerns including gender and sexualisation, race and national identity, children's rights, and activism (e.g. climate protests against fast fashion). Taking place within or showcasing leading collections of children's costume at the V&A Museum of Childhood, the Worthing Museum and Art Gallery, and the Musée du textile et de la mode in Cholet, France, the workshops will explore (specific) garments as a key source but will also position these within and alongside a diverse range of textual, visual and other material sources including memoirs, oral histories, children's books, photographs, paintings, newspaper and magazine coverage, trade items, and ephemera. Network activity aims to generate subsequent collaborative research projects between participants, as well as new creative works inspired by children's clothing. 'Childhood, Clothing, Creativity' responds to changes at the V&A Museum of Childhood, which is currently seeking to redeploy its collection of children's costume as it aims to become the world's leading museum of design and creativity for children, families and young people, and to inspire curiosity and build creative confidence in future generations. Network findings and discussions are planned eventually to feed into education and/or display in the Museum's three new permanent galleries, slated to open in 2022. The network also engages children collaboratively in the research. Network activity will begin with a collection visit at Worthing Museum where children respond to the clothing on display in creative ways (e.g. writing, drawing, video making), as well as to reflect on their own experiences of clothing. At the three network workshops, the children's responses will underpin the discussion. A final event, held after the grant's conclusion, will launch a section of the project website that archives the children's thoughts and creative work, allowing the children to see how their ideas shaped workshop discussion.","This network responds not only to scholarly concerns and preoccupations but also to pressing needs and debates issuing from beyond academia. It is designed to benefit the following key groups:  Practitioners in the museum and the heritage sector The network aims to engage the dozens of UK museums with collections of children's costume. In addition to the collections in museums and galleries dedicated to childhood (e.g. V&A Museum of Childhood, Edinburgh Museum of Childhood) or fashion (e.g. Platt Hall), numerous regional museums have such collections, including considerable holdings that are not currently on show--in part because of the complex questions of display and interpretation that are the subject of this network. An even greater number of museums use costume and dress in their education programmes. The project partners have been selected for representing different museological contexts for children's dress: museums of childhood (V&A Museum of Childhood) and of fashion (Musée du textile choletais), and regional museums with significant costume collections (Worthing). To impact museum and heritage organisations, the network will bring nationally and internationally renowned scholars, curators and artists to network events at project partners; involve curators as central network participants; and work closely with project partners to shape the parameters for the workshops. In addition to a specific workshop focused on innovative redisplay, all workshops will incorporate activities designed to engage with this issue. In particular, network activity responds to the planned redevelopment of the V&A Museum of Childhood and the methodological shift this redevelopment models, from a socio-historical model of childhood to a theoretical and practical engagement with children's creative potential and how this can be harnessed through dress/material culture. Artists who take inspiration from children's dress The particular interest in creativity aims to enhance the practice of artists whose work engages children's dress as a resource and point of inspiration (see Visual Evidence). This will take place through hands-on archival work in collections of children's costume but also through the dialogue established between participants who are creative practitioners, and those who are scholars or curators working in this area. The network hopes to inspire the artist participants to produce work engaging with the museum collections they visit; these works will be documented on the project website. Children and their parents In addition to being co-producers of knowledge about dress via the network, children and their parents are proposed beneficiaries of this research. This is intended to happen as insights from network discussions reshape how material culture is displayed and interpreted for children, and feed into museum learning aimed at children. The children who attend the initial event will be still more directly impacted, as their voices and testimony will both reshape the understandings of childhood, creativity and dress arising from this project, and influence the curatorial strategies of the heritage organisations involved in the network.  Policy-makers Governmental interest in children's dress often focuses on commercialisation and sexualisation, as in the Bailey Review completed in 2011. The network seeks to change the policy discussion so that it considers children's dress not only through this (of course important) negative lens but also as a positive part of childhood experiences and a crucial tool for engaging children with heritage and design processes. Dissemination of the research findings to policy-makers will occur through established channels in the two interdisciplinary research centres to which the PI and Co-I belong: the Centre for Innovation and Research in Childhood and Youth (CIRCY) at Sussex, and the Centre for Childhood Cultures at Queen Mary/the V&A Museum of Childhood.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV001787%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Analytic philosophy is generally regarded as one of the leading philosophical traditions in the English-speaking world, and it has also been growing in the rest of the world, most notably, over the last decade or so, in mainland China, following its earlier establishment in Taiwan. It is the main aim of this proposed network to investigate the historical and philosophical significance of these developments by comparing the history of analytic philosophy in China and Taiwan with its history in the West. Analytic philosophy in the West originated in the advances in logic that took place in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Around this time, too, China began to open up to Western influence, and terms from Western logic were translated into Chinese, inspiring not only work on logic in China but also interest in the logical aspects of traditional Chinese philosophy. A Chinese tradition of logic came to be constructed, and debates took place concerning the relationship between Chinese logic and Western and Indian logic. The Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the Second World War, the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and then especially the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976, hindered the further development of dialogue with the West; but in the last two decades mainland China has increasingly opened up, with Western philosophers being invited to teach and speak at conferences in China, and more and more translations of key Western texts being undertaken. In the English-speaking world, and especially in analytic philosophy, translation is all too often taken for granted, yet the translation of philosophical texts not only requires philosophical skills but also raises philosophical questions that are easily overlooked if working in just one language. One of the aims of the present project is to identify and explore precisely these questions. For example, basic terms concerning meaning (e.g. 'content', 'sense', 'reference', 'denotation', etc.) can be very usefully investigated by considering how they might be translated into different languages; and their translation into Chinese raises particular difficulties due to the different nature and structure of the Chinese language and the different culture in which that language has developed. Exploring the ways that basic terms of analytic philosophy have been - and are being - translated into Chinese can thus throw much light on the most fundamental ideas and implicit assumptions of analytic philosophy. Four workshops/conferences are planned: two to be held in York (summer 2014 and spring 2015) and two to be held in Beijing (autumn 2014 and autumn 2015). These will bring together analytic philosophers and historians of analytic philosophy in the West (especially in the UK) and in China (both mainland China and Taiwan). One workshop, in particular, will bring together the translators of The Oxford Handbook of the History of Analytic Philosophy (edited by Michael Beaney and published in 2013), which is currently being translated into Chinese under the directorship of Prof. Jiang Yi of Beijing Normal University, supported by a grant from the Chinese government. Some of the original contributors to the Handbook will be invited to Beijing to explore with the translators some of the key philosophical issues that have arisen in undertaking this translation. The project will be managed by a committee made up of the PI, Ci and representatives from other universities in Beijing, Taipei and the UK. The management committee will meet at each of the workshops and conferences. The project has the firm support from philosophers and universities in both Beijing and Taipei.","Analytic philosophy has long been seen as the preserve of western Anglo-Saxon society. Though little is currently known about the subject outside academia in non-western societies, interest is clearly growing, as evidenced by the commitment of the project partners. In an attempt to enhance understanding, appreciation and engagement beyond academia the project has approached the British Council (as the project clearly aligns with the British Council agenda as ""the UK's international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations"") to ask whether they would be prepared to host accessible and open public lectures in Beijing and in Taipei on the subject of western analytic philosophy. The lectures will be based upon the research but aimed at the general public curious to learn more about western philosophical culture. The lectures will be recorded and, if possible, filmed, and made available on the University project website. There is little appreciation and understanding of Chinese responses to western analytic philosophy in this country. Accordingly the project will endeavour to secure involvement by the British Council in London and to present (in English) a public lecture on Chinese analytic philosophy.  There will, therefore, be two beneficiaries from the project: the British Council and interested members of the public in China, Taiwan, and the UK. The project will enable the British Council to host an event that, without the research project, would not be possible. The public in China and in the UK will both benefit from an enhanced understanding, appreciation and opportunity to engage with analytic philosophy and Chinese developments in analytic philosophy. The public impact will be enhanced in China through the publication, in Chinese, and distribution of the Oxford Handbook of the History of Analytic Philosophy.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL015773%2F1

In particular, there is a pressing need for investment in equipment to support research into, and the curation of, the Institute's collections of skeletal remains. Through this award, we will procure a range of complimentary equipment that enables the in-depth microscopic analysis and digitization of archaeological remains. An optical light microscope uses visible light and lenses to magnify the image of a small sample. For example, light microscopes are used by Bioarchaeologists to observe the number and size of bone cells (osteons) within a thin section. In contrast, an SEM uses high-powered electrons to scan an object's surface to produce a highly magnified image, whilst also identifying the sample's chemical composition. When used together in a correlative fashion, light microscopy and SEM provide a range of applications to the study of different archaeological materials. The proposed equipment will therefore enhance the microscopy capabilities on offer at the IoA, and will support a range of applications in research and teaching. Moreover, it will allow academics to take their research in new directions thereby maintaining our position as a research leader in scientific archaeology. Our department works closely with museums, archaeological consultancies, and heritage organisations within and beyond London. A key priority for many heritage organisations is the preservation of archaeological specimens, and therefore the analysis of collections through non-destructive methods are vitally important. This equipment will therefore provide new avenues for research and teaching in Archaeology at UCL, whilst also facilitating the dissemination of scientific research, and enabling co-production through the technology's digital capabilities.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV011529%2F1

It aims to widen the range of people engaged in learning about and contributing to the local heritage in north east Scotland, particularly those who have previously been excluded such as young Scottish Travellers and members of the Polish community. Returning to the site of the Colony settlement on the slopes of Bennachie, this project moves beyond a focus on material histories to include the performance and creation of stories, song and drama as ways of engaging with lived heritage.","All of the activities in this proposal support impact and public engagement. Both community participants and members of the University team will be beneficiaries of the proposed activities. One of the key outcomes of the activities in this proposal will be the embodied knowledge and understanding of the tangible and intangible heritage around Bennachie through field visits, drama, story and song by members if the project team and partner community groups. Distinctively, this knowledge will reflect a wider cultural and linguistic diversity than previous related projects. It is sustainable knowledge that will be carried with participants into their everyday practices of heritage whether as a volunteer, educator or professional in the heritage field. This will be ensured by the workshop series that will draw together other local people with an interest in cultural and material heritage to participate and learn from each other. The activities will also lead to the production of material outputs for both locals and visitors to the region, including the situated drama and Polish materials for the Bailies of Bennachie app. The Polish-Scottish Song and Story Group will develop new work for recording and performance which will become a lasting part of their repertoire. Likewise the Young Travellers' work will also be performed, recorded and then curated by the Elphinstone Institute as part of their archive of living tradition bearers. Through the process of collaborative working members of the University team will develop a richer understanding of the effects of articulating the activities of community groups with very different approaches to and expertise in the cultural heritage of Aberdeenshire. The process of participation and outcomes of activities will inform future planned research in community heritage across disciplines and directly inform the development of course materials for University Programmes.  The University of Aberdeen has a serious commitment to ensuring research impact by embedding support for academics to develop public engagement with research activities. This is in line with the Concordat and Manifesto for Engaging the Public with Research, and is enabled by the University's Public Engagement and Researcher Development Units, which were awarded two national prizes by ARMA in 2015, (www.abdn.ac.uk/engage/about/index.php). The University hosts a number of public festivals including the May Festival, Being Human festival and the Festival of Social Science and the Elphinstone Institute also hosts a wide range of public events, such as traveller run events, the Ballad Bus and radio broadcasts for the local community radio station SHMU through which the work of the project can be shared with wider audiences.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP009654%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Despite its Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan (2013), the WHO reported in 2020 on the ""worldwide failure to provide people with the mental health services they need, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting a growing need for mental health support"" (WHO 2020). There is massive inequality related to the allocation of mental health resources in high- and low-income countries; due to the scarcity of financial and human resources, young people in Latin America rarely receive formal treatment for depression and/or anxiety (Rathod et al. 2017). However, despite the accumulated and ongoing adversity, and the lack of formal mental health care, 50-60% of young people in Latin America experience symptomatic recovery within one year (Stapinski et al. 2013, March et al. 2004). This Follow-On arises from a unique opportunity to bring OLA's ('Building Resilience' MR/S03580X/1) collaborative research on depression and anxiety amongst young people living in urban areas of Bogotá (Colombia), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Lima (Peru) to new audiences, using art and technology. For over two years, medical researchers in the UK and Latin America have worked together with arts organisations and young people to explore ways that participatory arts practices can usefully be understood as a resource that can support young people to build resilience and overcome depression and anxiety, specifically in contexts where accessing mental health services are neither a practical option nor a priority. The findings to date demonstrate that young people commonly report music, painting, drawing, dance and creative writing as being art forms/activities/processes that strengthen their relationships, affirm their sense of identity and build connections to social support systems and identities. An increased sense of political agency, an opportunity for psycho-social exploration, the promotion of values-based engagement and the development of rich artistic expression emerged as strong factors for participants in the workshops in Bogotá, Lima and Buenos Aires, which revealed the complexity of how the arts build mental health resilience for young people. It is now crucial that the voices and experiences of young people, the ultimate beneficiaries of initiatives, take a central role in the development and implementation of policies, interventions and activities to improve their mental health.  Collaboration with young people, arts organisations and policy-makers is at the centre of this project; a response to our partners' desire to continue to use arts-based methods to foreground their data and stories with their own wider communities, local governments, national authorities and international networks. Specifically, this Follow-On project places young people centre stage so that they have the necessary skills to advocate for and influence policy discussions about their mental health resilience and recovery. Young Ambassadors (16-24 year olds) with a history of activism will engage with the OLA research, and design, curate and facilitate creative conversations with policy-makers, ensuring that their urgent and consequential discoveries impact the development of mental health services. The programme will also bring together a network of partners, young people, arts organisations, stakeholders and policymakers from across Latin America, to develop a practical toolkit of arts-based mental health resources to share across the region and beyond. Young Ambassadors and artists from partner organisations will also co-produce public installations in Bogota, Buenos Aires, Lima, and online, which, alongside a bilingual communications campaign, will engage diverse local and international audiences with the original research findings about arts and young people's mental health.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX004708%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The project has two main aims: (1) to develop innovative ways of engaging with and self-guiding literary tourists/Ian Rankin readers around Edinburgh in collaboration with academic and industry partners; and (2) to explore the extent to which these new mapping tools have unforeseen (at the time of the original grant) commercial implications applications. This proposal builds upon research undertaken on an AHRC-funded project entitled 'Visualising European Crime Fiction: New Digital Tools and Approaches to the Study of Transnational Popular Culture' led by Dr. Dominique Jeannerod (who is Co-I on this project). The original project emphasised outreach to librarians, internet users and crime fiction readers but it was not foreseen that new digital technologies for visualising crime fiction might also have commercial applications.  The proliferation of mobile phone and tablet devices equipped with GPS-tracking has created new opportunities for storytelling and mapping that fluidly react to a user's location and movement. This project seeks to develop these opportunities by creating a prototype using a software system called StoryTrek in order to engage literary tourists/Ian Rankin readers in the physical spaces where the writing is set. The prototype output ('a locative narrative') will enable readers to move through Edinburgh while listening to an Ian Rankin/Inspector Rebus novel - Set in Darkness (2000) - that has been specially adapted for this purpose. StoryTrek is the first system that enables this kind of immersive, location-and-movement-aware storytelling; that is, storytelling that aligns user's physical location with story segments activated by specific motion patterns. The StoryTrek system makes it possible to create complex, 'augmented reality' multimedia narratives - in this case, an adaptation of Rankin's Set in Darkness, which has been chosen because it brilliantly places the city of Edinburgh (its physical spaces, its dark history, its myths) at the centre of the narrative and hence lends itself to this kind of adaptation. The software also enables the layering of historical maps and photographs over the contemporary map of Edinburgh (that will form the basis of the application), thereby allowing end-users to see how the city has evolved. This is especially significant in the case of Set in Darkness, which is centrally about the dynamic relationship between Edinburgh's past and present. Orion's audiobook version of the novel, which has been licenced to the project as part of Orion's 'in-kind' contribution, will be edited into 30-40 key extracts, each attached to a particular Edinburgh location, ordered numerically to reflect narrative chronology and saved into separate MP3 files. The MP3 files and additional content (e.g. historical photographs, maps) will be used as the basis for custom coding and building the locative narrative, using the StoryTrek system, which will be undertaken by the International Co-I at Carleton University, Canada. This proposal seeks to develop the commercial potential of crime fiction as a driver of tourism and enhance this potential by engaging with new software technologies and applications being developed in the creative economy. Rankin has been chosen for this project because he is the bestselling author of twenty one crime novels set in Edinburgh (i.e. worldwide sales of over thirty million books); because his work is renowned for an ability to imaginatively portray his respective setting; and because it already draws significant numbers of tourists to Edinburgh, thereby establishing a clear demand for what is being proposed. By working closely with the project's commercial partner and Rankin's publisher, Orion, and StoryTrek's designer (who is International Co-I) the aim is not simply to create a working prototype but specifically to market test it, using Orion's contacts and marketing expertise, and therefore to explicitly develop its commercial potential.","The Rankin StoryTrek aims to directly engage crime fiction readers and literary tourists with a new and exciting way of relating the specificities of crime fiction to the environment or place that has produced it. One general benefit will be the creation of an innovative prototype that has commercialisation potential and that demonstrates what can be achieved through close collaboration between academics, a software designer, a major publisher, and an internationally bestselling novelist in service of the creative economy.   The main benefits will be experienced by end-users (literary tourists, crime fiction readers) who will be able to use the prototype application to experience Ian Rankin's Set in Darkness as hypertext and adapted audiobook while simultaneously moving through the place it is set and in doing so gain a richer, more detailed understanding of relationship between fiction and place and of crime fiction's capacities for immersing readers in imaginatively conceived 'real' places. By layering a map of Edinburgh - that will form the basis of the Rankin StoryTrek - with historical photographs and maps and critical commentary, users will also gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the city's past and present and the novel's complex thematisation of this relationship. The direct benefit of the prototype will be captured and measured via feedback from users and this feedback will be used to amend and tweak the StoryTrek. The Rankin StoryTrek is built upon a well-defined demand, whereby Rankin's significance to Edinburgh's tourist industry and infrastructure has been established. The prototype has the potential to develop this demand, to the benefit of literary tourism in Edinburgh, while at the same time giving Rankin's publisher, Orion, an innovative platform to promote the work of one of their most famous authors. This pathway to impact will be further underscored by the involvement of Orion as project partner, insofar as the Group Rights, Audio and Digital Director the Digital Development and Technical Director at Orion have committed to help market-test and publicise the project using their extensive email/user-group lists and to include it as part of a larger celebration of 'Rebus at 30' to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the first Rebus novel (2017). Another beneficiary will be the StoryTrek designer who, as a result of this project, will be able to assess how well the software system can deliver a location-and-movement story of Set in Darkness's level of narrative sophistication and complexity. This will be the first time that an entire novel has been adapted for this purpose. StoryTrek as a brand will greatly benefit from the exposure resulting from the collaboration with a major global publisher - and this will, in turn, help in the longer-term ambition to turn StoryTrek into an open source (i.e. non-proprietorial) software system.  The Rankin StoryTrek authoring tool and reading client can be downloaded, free of charge, from a dedicated website housed in the Hyperlab at Carleton University and with links to it from Orion's corporate website. This will allow users to use their preferred devices.  One important outcome of the project is to 'prove' that the concept works and if it does, project partners are keen to explore whether it can be commercialised (i.e. whether users would be willing to pay for the product) and investigations, to this end, will take place at the end of the funding period. This pathway to impact will be further strengthened by a briefing meeting to be held at Hachette UK headquarters in London, the country's largest publishing group comprising Headline, Hodder & Stoughton, Quercus, Little Brown, and Orion. This will give the project team and partners the chance to think about the successes and limitations of the prototype and to discuss their sustainability in the long term, and to think about further collaborations involving new writers and new locations.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP013139%2F1

The project will be driven and implemented by an extremely experienced team including academics, NGO staff and development management professionals. We will concentrate specifically on the experiences of violence against young women and girls. The research will focus on understanding the intersections between young age and a range of vulnerabilities influencing young women and girls' resilience to violence and general wellbeing. The research process will enable the particular contextual vulnerabilities to emerge during the initial phases, but we predict a focus on a range of factors including cross-cutting issues of gender discrimination, intermittent access to education and training, livelihoods, racism, cultural conflicts and a general lack of youth decision making power. We know that girls and young women are highly vulnerable at times of conflict and post displacement caused by conflict however understanding these vulerabilities through a girl centred approach is lacking in how protective programming is designed and implemtented. This research then intends to develop innovative new methodologies in taking such an approach adhering to ethics and safeguarding practice.  We will take an innovative mixed-methods approach, combining art heritage techniques with quantitative and qualitative surveys and interview tools. This will offer a depth of insight into the ways in which varied categories of girls and young women understand and respond to their precarious positions post-displacement, and will help us to synchronise our participants' voices to provide meaningful messages for the future. Our project will have four strands, which are not strictly chronological. Strand 1: Scoping study of South Sudanese displacement and humanitarian interventions in South Sudan and Uganda. This will map relevant programming in the VAWG field, specifically focused on South Sudanese young people. As a part of this work, the strand will implement a detailed Systematic Review focused on drawing out the global evidence on what works to tackle violence against young women and girls. Strand 2: Evaluative learning processes to be implemented. Based on the scoping study we will select a range of completed programmes and conduct post-project evaluations to determine what has worked well, and what the key challenges have been in terms of building sustainable resilience to gender based violence and preventing this violence. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used for this strand. Strand 3: Thematic learning, drawing specifically on arts-based research methods. Our thematic learning will take an innovative mix of approaches from within the arts and humanities designed to capture experiences of vulnerabilities. As a team we have already designed and used such approaches which have proven to work well in sensitive contexts, including South Sudan and other countries. Strand 4: Design and pilot of new interventions. Based on the findings of strands 1, 2 and 3 we will work with young people in a selected context to design and implement a new intervention to target violence against displaced young women and girls. This will be driven by our Co-I Plan International, a hugely experienced international NGO. The intervention, which is likely to continue past project end, will be monitored closely to maximise further lesson learning.","This research project is action orientated and applied. Each of the four strands of research are geared towards generating key learning to support interventions to bring sustainable development to displaced young women and girls. The Strand 1 systematic review will identify key knowledge gaps, in addition to identifying where robust evidence on what works already exists. Stakeholder mapping is a key activity in the systematic review process and will help us to pinpoint where new evidence will support the work of organisations and governments on the ground. Our Strand 2 evaluations of ongoing interventions will help to create more evidence around what constitutes effective, cost efficient programming for the development of young women and girls. Our Strand 3 thematic research will be informed by the evidence gaps, and lessons emerging from both these strands. The final Strand 4 will draw on the evidence of previous strands to design a new intervention as part of the action approach. Our research will create impact from the start because of our Learning Alliance approach with development partners who are key players in designing interventions to support displaced young women and girls. The project will also develop an impact network across the contexts in which it will operate. In South Sudan we already have an active and engaged group of voluntary 'Learning Champions' including artist mentors, key humanitarian stakeholders, media professionals and academics. All our members have signalled their willingness to continue into this new project. We will expand this regional network, adding new key stakeholders in Uganda. In essence our Learning Champions will act as bridges between the research project and the constituents we are targeting at community level. Likikiri will also continue to reach out and build important links at community level through other organisations, building a channel through which more sensitive engagement between the grass-roots, government, development and humanitarian-development professionals may be achieved. A detailed community focused communication strategy/approach will be developed in the early stages of the network, facilitated by our uptake consultant Jon Gregson who will work closely with our partners at community level. We will also have impact on the Humanitarian-Development sectors by feeding through our community of practice into pre-existing knowledge sharing mechanisms. In our country contexts a cluster system operates which works to understand and share learning across implementing agencies, including downstream national partners. Based on thematic areas of work and practical implementation areas within countries, these groups of implementing organisations meet to discuss the practical logistics and technical challenges of working in complex contexts. Significant dissemination of knowledge happens within these groupings, and as a project team we have excellent access to them through the work of Plan International, Likikiri and Forcier Consulting (for whom a member of our advisory group works).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT007397%2F1

Does your cat love you? How do monkeys think about objects in their environment, and about each other? Can they really be said to think at all? The Rethinking Mind and Meaning project, funded as a part of the AHRC's Science in Culture theme, focused on understanding the minds of infants and animals from a scientific and philosophical perspective. This follow-on proposal aims to engage school pupils and underserved adults in prisons and the local community with this research, and thereby to build a critical understanding of science, including the ability to evaluate current research, and to build critical thinking skills applicable to many areas of work and life.  Working closely with teachers and pupils in Fife and in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, we will develop materials that will enable primary teachers to present cutting-edge empirical research in psychology to their pupils, to evaluate how this research bears on traditional philosophical questions about the mind, and to begin to think about new methodologies for answering questions about the minds of infants and animals. There is considerable demand for activities in these areas; primary schools in Fife, in particular, have recently adopted a programme of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) teaching that integrates arts and culture into science teaching. Our interdisciplinary research, which uses empirical techniques to investigate traditional philosophical questions about the mind, is a perfect fit for these aims, and we will collaborate with the developers of Fife's STEAM curriculum to ensure that our materials meet the needs of teachers and pupils. More generally, all of our activities will be collaboratively created with teachers and pupils, to ensure that they are useful in the classroom and genuinely engaging to a young audience. The result will include background information for teachers, activities tailored to pupils of different ages, and links to multimedia (such as videos of experiments). We will support teachers in the delivery of this material by a dedicated social media presence where they can ask questions (or pass on questions from their pupils), and by continuing professional development workshops throughout Scotland, focusing particularly on Highland and Island schools which may have limited access to University researchers due to their remote locations. And we will make the materials widely available to teachers by distributing them online through our website and in hard copy where there is demand. We will also deliver lessons directly to adult audiences, notably including prisoners in HMPs Perth and Polmont, and to underserved audiences in the local community. We believe that by teaching cutting-edge philosophical and scientific research, we can build skills in thinking critically about science and its methods. How can science answer intuitive philosophical questions about the mind? What are scientific methods, and how can they be applied in particular cases? What do the results of scientific experiments really show? Critical thinking skills of this kind are crucial not only for thinking through current scientific controversies - for example, about climate change, GMO crops, or alternative medicine - but also, in this age of ""fake news"" and ""alternative facts"", for full participation in politics and the public sphere.","The primary aim of this project is to engage primary school pupils and underserved adult audiences in cutting edge philosophical and psychological research about infant and animal minds. The main beneficiaries of the project will be: 1. Primary school pupils in Fife. Collaborating closely with teachers in Fife schools, including teachers at Thornton Primary who have developed resources for teaching STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) subjects that have been adopted by all 140 primary schools in Fife, we will develop activities and lesson plans that fit the STEAM curriculum. The interdisciplinary nature of our project makes it especially well suited to STEAM's emphasis on integrating arts and culture in science teaching, and by working with teachers and pupils we will be able to ensure wide adoption of our materials. 2. Primary school pupils in the Highlands and Islands. Collaborating with teachers from Highland schools, we will organize professional development workshops that will bring teachers at geographically isolated schools across Scotland up to speed on cutting edge research, and put them in a position to teach this material confidently. We will support teachers by providing opportunities to ask questions (or pass on questions from their pupils) on social media. 3. Underserved adult audiences, including prisoners at HMPs Perth and Polmont. Collaborating with the University of St Andrews's Cellblock Science programme, we will bring our research into prison learning centres.  Because we will make the materials available online, we hope that other audiences - in Scotland, the UK, and worldwide -- may also be impacted. The benefits of this engagement will go well beyond learning facts about our research. 1. Fife schools' STEAM resources focus on developing skills in formulating questions and developing investigations to answer them, in communication, and in the understanding, analysis, and evaluation of scientific research, as well as a general understanding of scientific methods, and of the role of arts, culture, and creativity in science. By presenting cutting edge research in which methodological difficulties and debates remain crucial, and the significance of various results remains controversial, we hope to develop these creative and critical skills, which we hope will generalize beyond the evaluation of science into many other areas of life. 2. By developing materials with teachers, and supporting them in the use of these materials, we will make possible pedagogical innovation; in particular we hope to build teachers' confidence in presenting recent research across science and the humanities. At every stage of the project, we will obtain evidence to enable us to evaluate the success of our engagement. Early in the project, we will involve teachers and pupils in the development of our materials and activities. We will seek their feedback and will use it to revise our materials. As the project continues, we will use social media and collaboration with school officials in Fife and in the Highlands and Islands to get precise information about the number of schools using our materials, the number of pupils engaged, and how they are affected.  More speculatively, we hope that engaging with our research will provoke audiences to rethink philosophy, science, and their own place in nature. The STEAM programme with which we are collaborating articulates a vision of science as driven by creativity, thereby creating innovations which drive the economy. Our research supports this vision; we see scientific investigations as having the potential to help answer intuitive, philosophical questions about the mind, and philosophy as having the potential to suggest new questions and new methodologies for scientists to investigate. Appreciating this research will give audiences a new perspective on how the human mind fits in to the natural world.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR00465X%2F1

Our previous AHRC-funded research 'Studying Classical Civilisation in Britain: recording the past and fostering the future' uncovered a wealth of historical evidence pointing to the educative value of Classics as part of a broad and balanced curriculum. Today, only a fraction-around 10%-of Britain's teenagers have access to the study of the Greeks and Romans at school, and the majority of these are in the independent sector. This is a problem of social justice which our research and active dissemination strategies aim to ameliorate by taking the Classical world to new audiences. Our project with MOCA focuses on the mental well-being of young people in the community and we are confident that this approach offers an inclusive pathway to engaging new audiences of teenagers, whose schools do not currently offer Classical subjects.  The current Ofsted framework examines the quality of the curriculum offered to pupils: 'inspectors will consider the extent to which schools are equipping pupils with the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life... helping to engender an appreciation of human creativity and achievement' (Ofsted 2019). This is an opportune moment for Classics to stage a comeback. Our research has identified that an efficient way to do this is via the study of the ancient world in translation. OCR's qualifications in Classical Civilisation and Ancient History can be taught by teachers who are specialists in allied subjects e.g. English, Drama, History, Philosophy or Religious Studies. Some curricular content is shared, and almost all the skills are transferable (Holmes-Henderson 2018). Yet these qualifications require promotion beyond the schools where Classics is traditionally taught. This is particularly the case in the North West of England. It is for this reason that we plan to work closely with LWM to amplify the dissemination of our original project's findings to teachers and students in schools in the north of England. There could be no better time to do this than in 2021, when LWM hosts its Classical exhibition. Holmes-Henderson visited the Lytham St. Annes Classical Association Branch in March 2020 (VE2) to judge a schools' competition and engaged with state school teachers from Bolton, Kirkton, Runshaw and Ashton-under-Lyne. These teachers requested help and support in their region, not 'always in London'.  'There is not currently enough money in state schools for textbooks, stationery and science equipment' (Weale and Adams, Guardian Article, 8th March 2019) so funding teacher professional development is a low priority for schools in times of budget cuts. Yet both the professional competency and personal morale of teachers is boosted by attending high-quality training which in turn improves student achievement in such high-stakes assessments as GCSEs and A Levels. Together with MOCA and LWM, we will provide free professional development for teachers (non-specialist, newly qualified and experienced) to ensure that our research findings reach new audiences and that they impact on learning communities around the UK. We will also improve the learning and teaching resources available for Classical Civilisation and Ancient History, by working with OCR and will make gallery guides so that prescribed objects in the British Museum are more accessible to teachers and students. Our follow-on funding proposals respond to requests from participants over the lifespan of our original project.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV006592%2F1

The 31,000 tablets and fragments found in the ruins of Nineveh, the capital of King Ashurbanipal's (668-631 BCE) empire, have been central to the modern study of Assyrian and Babylonian scholarship for almost two centuries now. Yet the sheer size and complexity of this corpus, together with uncertainties generated by the shortcomings of the pioneering excavation techniques and museological practices, have hindered our understanding of what that collection of texts actually represents. For while we now understand in detail particular texts or groups within the ""Library"", we know very little about the ""Library"" itself. A body of interpretations has accumulated, based on the experience of several individual scholars, but the evidence base for these interpretations is very weak. These interpretations are open to serious challenge.  Reading the Library of Ashurbanipal addresses the key question: What is ""Ashurbanipal's Library"", as we know it? The project approaches this question through three subsidiary research objectives, each of which leverages paratextual information to elucidate a significant section of the corpus. The first such objective, ""Understanding Colophon Types"", systematically analyses the scribal notes appended to Library tablets by establishing a new taxonomy and studying the relationship between the text contained on the tablets and the colophons appended to them. For the first time, it will establish how many tablets from Nineveh bear a library label and how many tablets belonged to collections other than Ashurbanipal's own. The second objective, ""Literature in Library Records"", correlates the tablets discovered at Nineveh with those mentioned in ancient lists recording acquisitions by Ashurbanipal. This will reveal key information about the scope of his collection, as well as how his library functioned. The third objective, ""Tablets to Nineveh"", exploits the information provided in the texts about the origin of the originals from which they were copied. The main points to be studied are how scholarly knowledge arrived at Nineveh, what the significance of the Assyrian and Babylonian inputs was, and what form they took. Reading the Library of Ashurbanipal makes it possible for the first time to offer an analysis of the ""Library"" based on detailed, systematic and thorough surveys of the evidence. It builds on many years of preparatory work, and utilises digital technologies to help overcome the otherwise unmanageable mass of material. The project relies on a series of carefully constructed studies to investigate aspects of the Library that have never been the topic of serious scrutiny, and benefits from the uniquely close relationship of British Museum staff with the collection and from the pioneering methods to study cuneiform tablets developed at LMU Munich.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT012773%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project is a groundbreaking new study, based on the earliest known Persian documents written in the Islamic East's Bamiyan Valley. For the first time, we will study the earliest form of Persian writing provided in ca. 200 Afghan geniza documents, which were purchased in 2013 and 2016 and are now held in the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem. Pre-Islamic Bamiyan, together with Balkh, were the centres of Buddhist monastic and temple activity in late antique Afghanistan. Bamiyan's giant buddhas were the largest standing buddhas built in antiquity, and became the symbols of Islamic fundamentalist violence when the Taliban bombed them in 2001. While much of the public attention has been on the question of why the buddhas were so tragically bombed, our fascination is with their survival for 1400 years prior; that is, since the arrival of Islam to the Balkh-Bamiyan area. Thus, through an in-depth study of the 'Afghan geniza' documents, PersDoc offers major new insights in two key areas: 1) the development of written Persian and its importance in the creation of a cultural identity, and 2) the consolidation of Islam and Islamization in the eastern Islamic lands. While a significant number of these documents were written by Jews, and within a particular family archive, it is, in fact, highly unlikely that they belonged to any sort of geniza, i.e. storage site for documents and written sources at a synagogue. However, they are now identified as such, and the term Afghan geniza has entered scholarly parlance. The documents as a whole more likely belonged to various family archives, some of which belonged to non-Jews as well. They are delightfully varied, including personal letters, business notes, loan receipts, and literary extracts. Many are dated, ranging between the 11th to the early 13th century C.E. The documents attest to the daily economic, political, judicial and cultural lives of residents in the Bamiyan Valley. This is completely new, matchless, and eye opening. The story that the Afghan geniza documents tell is one of cooperation and collaboration on economic and business transactions between Jews and Muslims, and one of adoption and adaptation in religions and legal matters. Their story is one we never hear: a story of a multicultural society, in which people of different religions thrived and collaborated, adopted cultural ideas and practices from one another, and underwent dynamic changes. These documents deserve attention and analysis: they must be identified in detail, systematically categorised (in rubrics of content, form, date, and style), and analysed by language and historical content. For the latter, we will cross-reference with the literary record in medieval Islamic and Chinese historiography, as well as with recent archaeological survey findings in the Bamiyan Valley (including radio carbon dating of the paintings in the niches behind the Bamiyan buddhas, which point to the continued patronage of the Buddhist site long after the Islamic conquests). The documents also need to be made as widely available as possible to maximise dissemination about their rich significance: that Muslims and non-Muslims co-existed and thrived together, and that multiculturalism is possible and positive in the Islamic world. Thus the project has as its tertiary aim the facilitation of dialogue between scholars and wider public circles to counter the very sustained campaign by neo-conservative essayists and polemicists to discredit the Islamization narrative as solely one of violence and intolerance, and inhibit any serious discussion of it. We will do this by producing short videos with scholars, by designing an educational tool for adults and young adults worldwide that will be made publically accessible through our website, and by engaging with major media outlets to discuss our project and its findings.","Users and beneficiaries of the PersDoc research who are outside the academic research community can be grouped into five: 1. Policy-makers and bilateral partners and donors that are interested in supporting cultural heritage work in Afghanistan and the region with a peacemaking and development agenda. They will see how an interdisciplinary project on the history of religion in Afghanistan can send positive messages and counter neoconservative narratives that stymie any serious discussion of Islam and Islamization. 2. International organisations, such as UNESCO, can report how their conservation efforts in Bamiyan are enabling historical research, and thus acquire more support for their efforts to maintain funding for cultural heritage work in Bamiyan. 3. Cultural heritage practitioners and professionals in Afghanistan and Bamiyan can better understand the historical relevance of their work, and link it into a contemporary narrative and make it relevant to present political debates. 4. The media will run stories on topics related to the Project, drawing on our recorded interviews, but also interviewing PersDoc team member live for commentary on the historical findings and questions of the project. 5. The wider public in general will include MOOC learners worldwide (we are targetting 10,000) who register to take our MOOC and learn about the history of Bamiyan, Buddhism and Islamisation at an important crossroads of medieval cultural and trade routes about which little was known prior to PersDoc. We also aim to draw our net widely to users of our web pages in Europe and the West, but also Afghanistan and the wider Persian-speaking world (through the Persian language entries on our web pages), and beyond. All five audiences will benefit in largely similar ways, but by different means (see Pathways to Impact). This research challenges scholarly, official and popular perceptions that Islam and Islamization is 'un-European' and incompatible with 'western ideals' because it is inherently violent and culturally intolerant. By drawing attention to the everyday interactions between diverse actors in a pre-modern Islamicate region, we raise the idea that religions widely regarded as fundamentally distinct may have been more similar and inter-connected than we thought. We provide important historical context for a present-day situation in which neoconservative rhetoric finds limited push-back from a balanced, academically-sound discussion. Our work suggests, for instance, more nuanced approaches to reports of the Bamiyan's buddhas as being part of ""Buddhist history"" (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/03/afghanistan.lukeharding) when they are a part of Islamic and Afghan history. Such events are routinely presented by Islamic fundamentalists and western media as a religious conflict between Muslims and 'the infidel' non-Muslims. Articles including images of buddhas in Afghanistan invoke preconceived notions about Buddhism as Far Eastern and Islam as ""Arab"" and may even suggest that this is a conflict between western (Hellenistic) and eastern (Muslim) worlds. Our activities with all of our audiences will show the value of reducing the emphasis on issues such as religion and Arabism and competing ways of life, and instead considering a combination of other dimensions, including government policy, inter-religious cooperation and collaboration, and economic factors. The impact of our work will be to highlight that people of different cultures, languages and ethnic identities, and practising different economic activities, engaged in a complex set of interactions that is reflected in documentary and material remains even though it is stereotyped in the written record.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS002596%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This 3-year interdisciplinary project will investigate the experiences of, and repercussions for, children who do not find it easy to 'fit in' at school. While such feelings are not always traumatic, statistics produced by Young Minds (2016) suggest three children in every classroom have diagnosed mental health issues. This proposal has been developed in partnership with the school where the research will be located, Alma Park Primary School in Levenshulme, Manchester, selected for its diverse school and local communities.  This research is timely, firstly, in its innovative approach to rethinking 'difference' to contribute new knowledge to the anti-bullying and inclusion agendas in school and secondly, in its methodology, building on the developing field of community co-produced knowledge (Facer and Enright, 2016), and focusing the lenses of art and anthropology on both the substantive inquiry into oddness, and the theoretical work of developing interdisciplinary methodology and protocols. Over the last 5 years the UK government has invested heavily in diversity, mental health and wellbeing, with a particular focus on young children's resilience (DfE, 2016; DoH, 2014). The day-to-day work of our partner school reflects the ethos of many schools; informed by such initiatives, their commitment to 'celebrating difference' palpable, yet they express concern for individualising discourses that filter down from educational policy, collectively defining who falls outside of educational and social norms. The proposed project recognises that an interdisciplinary approach is needed to break out of conventional educational thinking about difference and conformity. We will bring together perspectives from art, anthropology and education to examine how feeling a 'misfit', 'loner' or the 'odd one out' can have a detrimental impact on some children, whilst recognising others may occupy this space more confidently. Children are perceived as capable, skilled social actors in the world, who have fascinating perspectives on this topic. Working in co-production with a whole primary school community, involving children from all year groups (aged 4-11), parents, teachers and non-teaching staff, the research will produce different kinds of practice-based collaborations to ask pressing and difficult questions of policy rhetoric and practices in school via interrogations of the generative idea of odd; what odd means; what its value is and why this matters, what it tells us about ordinary, everyday encounters with one another, places and things. The research collective will develop arts-led strategies and other resources for minimizing the destructive effects of feeling 'odd' or 'different', but will also attempt to harness the potency of difference as a force for creativity, empowerment and policy critique. For our purposes, the term odd opens a space for thinking otherwise in a school context where powerful discourses of difference, diversity and inclusion (Norwich, 2014) rub up against material processes of normalisation and conformity (Brisard, Menter & Smith, 2010). This project will generate new interdisciplinary knowledge, enhance understandings and develop creative insights into how art theory and practice, together with social science methodologies contribute empirically to an emerging field of work that attends to difference differently (Barad, 2014).  The project team have the expertise required for this interdisciplinary study: a visual anthropologist with expertise in interdisciplinary connections between anthropology and art/design (Ravetz); a socially engaged artist working in large social environments where people, object and places interact (Shaw); a co-production consultant (Pool) and educationalist (Pahl) with extensive knowledge of co-production and empirical work in schools; a PI with extensive experience of externally-funded research on children and childhood and interdisciplinary, arts-informed methodologies (Holmes).","This research will generate impact in the third sector, within professional and practitioner groups, the Levenshulme community and the wider public in general. The approach to all aspects of knowledge exchange comes out of our long-term co-produced work with our partners, Alma Park School and its local community; as well as our collaborations with Catalyst Psychology, NCB and The Showroom gallery. Letters of support are attached to this application.  The project has four key impact objectives: 1. Development of new ways of understanding and responding to children who do not find it easy to 'fit in' at school 2. Provision of alternative inclusive practices in education and contributions to behaviour and anti-bullying policies 3. Mobilise the value and potential of oddness to empower children, families and local communities 4. Raise awareness of the importance and potential of research collaborations across art, anthropology and education  Pathways to achieving these impact objectives are outlined below.  Professional and practitioner groups (teachers, classroom-based practitioners and Educational Psychologists) a) Develop practitioner reflexivity: Exhibitions, Odd celebration, training and CPD sessions, short film & user package will strengthen the critical reflexivity of Educational Psychologists, teachers and other classroom practitioners within the school, across the school's Cluster Group and in training opportunities for mental health organisations such as Catalyst Psychology to consider framings of children, families and ways of knowing. b) Promote curriculum and school development The outputs will inform teachers' reflective development across the curriculum, particularly in areas of the arts and inclusion c) Initiate changes to training, school policy and practices The project will produce a new 'Inclusion manifesto' to effect changes to school policy and practices. The work will produce practice development and training opportunities for NCB who work with children and families, national policy-makers and practitioners to research, innovate and establish best practice across the children's sector. The project outputs will force the reconsideration of labels, stereotypes, behaviour and diagnoses. Practitioners will also benefit from the use of interdisciplinary research methods. Local community and the wider public: Community of Levenshulme, Manchester a) Raising awareness of, and debating the importance of 'diversity', including eccentricity, quirkiness and non-conformity in communities Families & local community will have opportunities to rethink and reflect positively on issues affecting their lives such as social cohesion and difference. The Odd Secret event among the other community-based exhibitions and celebrations will encourage community participation to harness the potency of differences in the community as a force for creativity, empowerment and policy critique. Third Sector: Museums and galleries (The Showroom) and Charities (NCB) a) Exhibition work  The Showroom is respected for projects that work with communities, artists and social issues to generate discussions, events and exhibitions, Odd resonates strongly with their 'Communal Knowledge' project. The school-based 'Odd Exhibition' feeds into The Showroom final exhibition, with the intention of offering a national event. The movement of the work from school to public exhibition, places new demands on the work, needing to communicate outside the school space not just within it, and generates spaces for discussions in the gallery about the role of the children as subjects and/or critics.  b) Creating new research networks The Odd Lab will open up and sustain new networks for exploration of follow-on events and further funding opportunities. Through the Odd Celebration and Odd Exhibition, we will broaden the odd network to draw in other potential partners in the pursuit of further funding.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR004994%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Stone tools are the hallmark of prehistoric settlements around the world: in the Caribbean, as elsewhere, they were essential for basic tasks (e.g., food processing, wood carving) and also fulfilled roles as prestige objects. Being entirely limestone islands, the vast Bahama (Lucayan) archipelago-comprising over 720 islands-is unique in the Caribbean in entirely lacking hard stone (flint, basalt, jadeitite). Was this lack of such a critical resource a contributing factor in their late settlement post-AD 600, despite being surrounded by islands with occupation going back millennia? And once settled, how was access to hard stone achieved, and what does this tell us about people's abilities to adapt to challenging environments?  Project SIBA ('stone' in Classic Taino dialect) aims to answer these questions by bringing together a multi-disciplinary group of leading researchers in a comprehensive study of the largest corpus of Lucayan stone artefacts ever assembled: >300 'exotics' held in 8 international museums. Our aim is to characterise the regional social networks that bound the Lucayan archipelago to the wider Caribbean region, and potentially to the continental mainland, and so provide an understanding of the creation and maintenance of indigenous exchange networks, and their concomitant economic, cultural and socio-political impacts. One direct means of exploring these issues is through the study of the imported material culture itself, including identifying each artefact's provenance through its diagnostic chemical and isotope 'signature' via state-of-the-art geochemical techniques. Distinctive iconography is a complementary means of 'sourcing' artefacts; conversely, the absence of convincing stylistic and petrological comparanda from neighbouring regions would imply the local reworking of stone in the creation of a distinctive Lucayan cannon, expanding understanding of local carving styles, which are themselves poorly known. The project remit works both at the micro- and macro-scale to explore the connections between people and the stones they worked, traded and valued. It aims to better understand resilience and sustainability in resource-poor island contexts, and to question the core-periphery relations that have dominated discourse in Bahamian archaeology.  Often seen both geographically and culturally as peripheral to the large-scale cacicazgos (chiefdoms) of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas/TCI were initially (~AD 600) used as seasonal outposts by groups from Hispaniola and Cuba, to harvest the rich marine and salt resources. Permanent villages were only established around AD 1000. Initially, access to igneous or metamorphic stone was not an issue, because seasonal groups must have transported such basic necessities with them. Once permanent settlements were established, settlers likely maintained contact with their homeland for a variety of reasons, access to stone materials among them. Later, when independent polities emerged, an exchange network must have been established, with stone exotics imported not solely as necessities, but as valuables and high status goods used to differentiate the emerging Lucayan cacical (chiefly) hierarchies. Would these exchanges have echoed the original sources of the migrating group, or would the Lucayans have sought more far flung connections to emphasise their growing independence? Working in collaboration with 8 project partner institutions, including the National Museums of both the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, the project will provide the first comprehensive regional overview of stone interchanges within the Lucayan archipelago, integrating the region into Caribbean-wide discourse on exchange and interaction, and significantly augmenting artefact information, and so enhancing museums' abilities to display and interpret their collections to diverse audiences. The results will contribute directly to planned museum exhibits, workshops and educational outreach.","Project benefits and beneficiaries range across a wide range of areas and remits: 1/Harnessing the potential of underutilised museum collections  Stone artefacts, such as celts, are among the most common artefacts in museum collections, whether from the Caribbean or Europe. Often recovered as surface finds-hence with little stratigraphic or contextual information-they frequently languish in museum shelves, sometimes dozens to a box, with at best cursory information when displayed at all. Yet there is great potential for these collections to contribute invaluable data to debates of past interactions/exchanges and value systems, through an engagement with their materiality (manufacture, style, material properties, etc.). Now, with the emergence of non-invasive techniques that can inform on provenance histories, the data collected can enhance museum records and displays, directly benefitting visitors, curators and researchers, while ensuring the best care for the artefacts. The research highlights the benefit of long-term museum care and storage of cultural patrimony, most especially of objects whose value is not immediately apparent due to the paucity of associated information. Bringing these little known collections to wider attention by utilising their inherent research potential goes some way to justify the investment of care that continues to go into their safe keeping, underscoring collections management, and enhancing institutional documentation and interpretation. 2/Making museum collections accessible to diverse audiences Web and museum-based exhibits are planned project outputs, with workshops and associated outreach activities aimed at a range of audiences-from school groups/college students to the general public. Institutions within both the Bahamas (Antiques, Monuments and Museums Corporation [AMMC], Gerace Research Centre, College of The Bahamas) and Turks and Caicos (Turks and Caicos National Museum [TCNM]) have expressed particular interest in making the results accessible to their diverse audiences-both local and international. This will have a variety of impacts-from exhibits in the 'out' islands and using local collections to enhance school curriculums to contributing to more informed tourism (economically critical to the Bahamas/TCI).  3/Building collaborative links (multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary) The project develops collaborative networks between colleagues in diverse international venues, including eight museums (four of which are national museums: TCNM, AMMC, National Museum of the American Indian, and National Museum of Natural History), and two academic institutions (Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands; Universidad de Granada, Spain). The project partner museums and cultural organisations are the direct stakeholders in the project, and through them, their local, target audiences as well as the wider international community, including academic as well as public sector beneficiaries (e.g., Caribbeanists, archaeologists, Bahamian/TCI diaspora). Working in collaboration with these various stakeholders bridges different sectors and their remits, enhancing information across regional boundaries and disciplines. 4/The value of cultural heritage (policy and practice) The project has the full support of the AMMC and TCNM (both project partners in the study), who advise their governments on archaeological and cultural heritage management and protection. Raising wider public awareness of these artefacts, and through them, of the Lucayan past, works to enforce the importance of local Bah/TCI heritage, which in turn, can impact on future public policy and legislation for cultural resource management. There is a need to do this, as indigenous heritage is not as prominent, and perhaps not as valued, as aspects of the historic, colonial past - and tourist industry development on the islands has had a history of destroying archaeological sites largely unimpeded.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN007476%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This research aims to contribute to the debate around community filmmaking and cultural diversity by exploring how cultural diversity intersects with community filmmaking. It will examine the results of this intersection in terms of representations and identities, as well as practices and innovation. In addition, the research will develop a better understanding of the role of cultural policy in supporting this intersection, by examining how cultural organisations and policymakers work with community filmmakers and how the role of innovation in this context is understood. The project recognises the complex set of cultural, economic and social relationships and engagements in community filmmaking. Therefore, our research will adopt a complexity framework to take a wider perspective to this object of study. Whilst the focus is on creative practitioners (community filmmakers), we aim to consider the cascade of connections which are behind their engagement with communities and partners, industries and audiences and which may impact on the cultural product and experience delivered as well as in urban/local development.  Applying complexity thinking to this field of investigation allows us to consider the role of cultural experiences and cultural identities in community filmmaking practice by taking into consideration five important dimensions by which these interactions can be mediated: representation and identity, the role of film as media, the tensions in filming practices between arts and commerce, the knowledge and innovation dynamics and the roles of intermediaries, policy and place. Complexity theory offers us the possibility to explore and understand these five different dimensions of community filmmaking but also to explore their interconnections in a more holistic way.  Community filmmakers will be the key agents considered in this complex system where practice, innovation and policy will be explored at different scales of interaction: micro, meso and macro levels. Across these levels, we will explore how different communities (through interaction, feedback, cooperation) share the work of filmmakers and vice-versa. At another level we will consider how community filmmakers are themselves embedded in a cultural field that is inhabited by major institutions (such as the British Film Institute (BFI)), other filmmakers, venues and associations, funders (such as Arts Council England) and how these shape and influence both their work and their decision-making.  Our research will be developed and carried out in collaboration with a range of community partners in three different UK regional settings (Birmingham, Southampton and London), each with different roles within this cultural field. These include Lighthouse, City-Eye and WORLDwrite, all of whom have expressed support for the project. We also have the support of the BFI who says that the 'Community filmmaking and Cultural Diversity' project will enrich the organisation's 'own knowledge and contact with this area of film culture' (BFI Letter of Support). This is significant because we hope to be able to take this research collaboration further in relation to its potential impact on film sector policy at both the national and sub-national levels. The research project's contribution to the AHRC Connected Communities programme will be twofold. Firstly, it will gather a better understanding of community filmmaking and diversity within the context of community engagement, representation and participation, considering the role played by arts and media (through film) in shaping and involving communities. Secondly, it will look at community filmmakers as being themselves part of a knowledge and practice community and consider what kind of learning, sharing and collaborative approaches are used to foster creation and innovation and how these can feed into the wider film ecology.","Our impact strategy rests on 1) working with our community partners and community film makers 2) making the whole research project part of a networked conversation and 3) generating a wide range of dissemination materials including online platforms, policy briefings and academic analysis. The research team itself is rich in impact-generation expertise and will work closely to sustain momentum through online media and other engagement activities. Our ambition is for this work to provide a reference point for evaluations of community filmmaking in culturally diverse contexts and its relationship with the wider film ecology.  To achieve this, we need to make the process part of an ongoing dialogue with key stakeholders recognising the cross-disciplinary nature of the problems we address. To this end, we have budgeted for a series of face to face conversations across the whole project and in relation to the five dimensions of the project outlined. These exchange sessions are paralleled by our online dissemination strategy which will aim to make the project a key node in national and international 'Connected Communities' research. We will begin this strategy by inviting collaborating partners to contribute to a 'Community Filmmaking and Cultural Diversity' blog; a blog will allow us to document responses from our 'audience'.  First, we have carefully selected partners who provide direct channels of impact, each with different roles within this cultural field, and in three different geographical regions. These include Lighthouse, City-Eye and WORLDwrite. Our work with WORLDwrite for example, will have a direct developmental impact upon the scale and potential of its operation. Documenting its innovative processes around community filmmaking in relation to the idea of the 'learner-volunteer' and 'citizen television', will provide a motivational illustration of what can be achieved by an informal community of creative citizens; this aspect of our work could be influential in communities which lack strong connections to mainstream media and indeed higher education. We also have the endorsement of the BFI for our project; significant because we hope to be able to take this research collaboration further in relation to its potential impact on policy. One of the objectives of the project is to support cultural organisations in how they reflect on their own practice around community filmmaking and in how diverse practitioners are engaged.  The second aspect of our impact strategy is to produce a range of outputs with utility in different sectors. Our media platform and policy briefing will find users throughout the emergent network of local/national organisations supporting connectivity in communities through innovative community filmmaking practice. The workshop and conference will provide fora for community filmmakers and organisations to make their views heard and their contributions felt. The events will provide an opportunity for academic and non-academic users to share knowledge about the scope of and issues around community filmmaking culture in current culturally diverse contexts and the role of innovation here. This potential will be sustained after the events through the development of a mailing list of all attendees which will serve for further communication about the project.  Among the impact tools we expect to deploy are the following: - a website & embedded blogging platform, targeted at other relevant communities of filmmakers and support organisations; - academic papers, targeted to academics & policymakers; - an edited scholarly book, summarising the research findings in comparison with other research and experiences, targeted to policymakers, academics & practitioners; - a policy briefing paper, targeted to communities, practitioners & policymakers; - one workshop event, targeted to communities, academics & practitioners;  - a closing conference, targeted to communities, academics & practititioners.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK006495%2F1

The project is particularly interested in historical empathy - challenging visitors at historical landscapes and sites of heritage to step into the shoes of past generations, facilitating a more subjective engagement with past events and circumstances than would otherwise be possible. Heritage offers a viable framework for testing empathic approaches because it attracts broad public interest, and enthusiastic public audiences on whom to test project outputs. Visitors to historic sites are familiar with questions of perspective, evidence, and intention when being invited to think about historical actors and situations, and with imaginative approaches to historical reconstruction and interpretation. Heritage organisations such as the National Trust and Historic Royal Palaces have shown a good deal of interest in developing more immersive, 'realistic', affective and emotional experiences for their visitors in recent years, and a number of innovative approaches have now been trialled. However, little or no research has been carried out to assess what an empathic visitor engagement might require or the extent to which existing models have been successful. Heritage Empath seeks to do three things therefore: 1) to reach a better understanding of the value of empathy as an applicable and practical tool in problem solving, 2) to research current best practice (both in and beyond the heritage field) and build an application for empathic engagement that works and is designed to be adaptable for use in a variety of fields in human social relations, 3) to test that knowledge by building a case study around past and present experiences of migration in a single British city, Bristol. Heritage Empath collects and curates the personal stories of historical and living migrants to the city and incorporates them into an immersive and interactive experience, freely downloadable to personal mobile devices, and then carefully evaluating its impact upon audiences. Using this framework as a basis, we hope to create a simple to use, adaptable product for marketing to stakeholders in the heritage industry and to ask, can challenges to social relations in the present day be beneficially approached through association with comparative historical experience? Can we better understand contemporary social problems through the perspective and experience of others, by first encountering them in the 'safety zone' of historical imagination? Heritage Empath works with past experience, in place, and then applies it to the present in innovative and subjective form.","Who will benefit? The project has three primary impact targets: Heritage and museum professionals, communities traditionally regarded as 'hard to reach' by the heritage sector, and practitioners in the experience design sector of the creative economy. It is anticipated however, that impact will extend beyond these sectors to a much wider range of potential beneficiaries. Empathic approaches to conflict resolution and social cohesion, for example, have very broad application and although the project is framed in the first instance as a heritage interpretation tool, it is explicitly intended that outputs will be adaptable for use in wider arenas. Equally, although two specific heritage audiences are addressed, we expect benefits for all audiences that engage with it. How will they benefit? Heritage and museum professionals will benefit from the research we conduct into the current and potential use of empathic software in experience design as well as from the material output of the project. We anticipate keen interest from this sector and we expect our work to influence future trends in empathic experience design. Two 'hard to reach' communities are envisaged as beneficiaries: young people and Black & minority ethnic (BME) communities. The project will be developed iteratively through a series of workshops in every stage of production, and work with both these groups will be emphasised. BME participants will be closely involved in the collection of oral histories of migration and we will appoint an RA with particular expertise in and familiarity with this field of research. BME participants are expected to benefit therefore, not only by making their stories and experience heard, but as co-curators of project outputs and, more broadly, as potential audiences at the project's conclusion. Similarly, we will work with youth groups through two successful organisations, the Cultural Youth Forum and My Future My Choice, the educational arm of the Bristol Charitable Initiative Trust. It has an excellent reputation for aspirational work with groups of young people from Bristol's more geographically peripheral schools, and the Principal Investigator has collaborated with them on historically-informed themes for a number of years. Importantly, the project will also create impact for Splash & Ripple and the wider experience design sector of the creative economy. By working collaboratively with university academics on the core design dimensions of the Empath experience, and with support from the Advisory Board, Splash & Ripple will be able to bring a powerful new audio augmented reality offer to the marketplace. With this, they will help clients from a range of backgrounds tell their stories in a new and powerful way. As a small creative company, Splash & Ripple regularly work in response to client briefs but rarely have the opportunity to develop their own projects. In these circumstances, it is often difficult to nurture pure research or creative and theoretical development. But Heritage Empath will create a step change for deepening the company's creative output through allowing them space to focus primarily on development of design aspects of the concept, as well as prototype software bases.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP013333%2F1

Situating the work within artistic practices that deal with repair, the proposal brings together a broad, interdisciplinary intersection of scholarly and entrepreneurial activity. Focusing on urban and rural repair activities three Network meetings will take place: 2x UK, 1x India. This includes a final UK Symposium at which knowledge gained during the meetings will be shared and disseminated.  Focusing on processes of reuse, upkeep, fixing, mending, extending, augmenting, hacking, tinkering, restoration, preservation and customization, each Network meeting will address these process in relation to different forms of repair: critical (relating to artistic practices and aesthetics), craft (relating to heritage and tradition), entrepreneurial (relating to new forms of capital, business and economy) and essential (borne out of immediate need). With the aim to -  1. Map what responsible consumption and production means through cultures of repair, reuse, maintenance, with a focus on their associated value systems, modes of labour, and forms of economy and styles of production. 2. Examine practices from the fields of contemporary art on repair and bring such knowledge's together with understandings from the fields of critical urban studies, geography, consumer and material studies and sustainability.   Positioning the Network in the context of policies which call for more circular and restorative approaches to manufacturing, such as United Nations (UN) Global Sustainable Development Goals (2016) and New Urban Agenda (2016), Defra, UK reports (2013) and various EU Directives (2008, 2012). Within these policies recycling and waste management, as opposed to repair and maintenance, still remains a central narrative. Repair presents a new set of challenges, as it demands we address issues further up the manufacturing chain or process, before products, services, objects, buildings and 'stuff' come to the ends of their lives. Repair requires us to tackle strategies for planned obsolescence and its associated material flow, by demanding that we shift the conversation from the rhetoric of the 'new' as a means of progression and innovation, to realities of broken-world logics, maintenance, care and upkeep.   Artists such as Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Amy Balkin, Benjamin Gaulon, Kim Cascone and Linda Bothwell to name but a few, have for many years been working with ideas of maintenance, failure, breakdown and upkeep in their creative practice. However, within the context of academia and policy, knowledge of such artistic practices is limited. Likewise, artists and practitioners are often out of the loop of academic thinking and discourse. Within the last five year there as been an academic 'turn' towards repair, with emerging work coming from various disciplines including urban and critical geography, media studies, material and consumption studies, architecture and design. Despite this academic thinking remains scattered across various disciplines and sub-disciplines. Additional the UK lags behind other global leaders on repair legislation. It is for this reason the Network reaches out to partners in France, the US and Thailand with one of the Network meetings been held in India, which has an established and growing, informal green economy sector from which, much can be learnt. Responding to these various needs and opportunities, the RRM research network brings together an international cohort of contemporary artists, academics, practitioners, social entrepreneurs & policymakers to discuss, consolidate and explore the field and its future directions.","One of the seventeen United Nations (UN) Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calls for 'responsible consumption and production', and identifies an urgent for changes to global consumption patterns and in order to reduce pressure on resources. Similar imperatives are outlined in the UN, New Agenda (2016), Defra, UK reports (2013) and EU Directives 2008/98/EC and 2012/19/EU. In these documents, circular and restorative approaches to manufacturing are seen as key. Despite such initiatives, cultures of repair and restoration are by and large overlooked within academic practice, with the UK seriously lagging behind other national initiatives. For example, Sweden (Guardian, 2016) has proposed to introduce tax breaks on all forms of repair, with the aim to stimulate the repair industry and reduce waste. In the US the Repair Association advocates for electronics built with the principles of easy repair, free and easy modification, and easily-available tools, parts, and repair documentation. In June 2017, the online magazine Motherboard (Vice) reported that New Jersey became the twelfth state to introduce the ""Fair Repair Act"" with the US. Similarly in July, Motherboard report that the EU plan to announce a similar act, which would require for example electronics manufacturers to make their products more easily repairable.   In addition to such legislation, the surge in Repair Cafes, and initiatives such as London's Restart Project and Brooklyn's Fixer's Collective, provides evidence that the repair of objects is becoming (again) a valued everyday practice. While within the field of contemporary art and design, a myriad of artists and designers have been working directly with concepts of repair, reuse, breakdown, failure, glitch and maintenance. This work is poised to make a valuable contribution in relation to the UN's, 12th sustainability goal on responsible consumption and production. Within the humanities and the social sciences there have been a steady but scattered number of studies on repair published over the last few decades.  New research is now emerging, as evident in Graziano and Trogal's recent call for papers (April 2017) on 'Repair Matters' for a special issue in the journal ephemera. The resurgence of interest in cultures of repair intersects with new discourses of degrowth, decay, and displacement (D'Alisa, Demaria and Kallis, 2015; Desilvey, 2006; 2017), which take 'seriously the seemingly banal fact that things are constantly falling out of place' (Dominguez, 2016, p. 60), and recognise that our digital worlds are as material, as any other physical artefact or object--and therefore bound to continual cycles of articulation and disarticulation. In terms impact, the RRM network will therefore provide a forum for these conversations to take place by laying the foundation for a range of follow-on research projects, with significant potential for future impact on both policy and academic research in related fields. With the aim to specifically generate impact in the following areas:   Theory: Consolidate research in repair from the fields of material and media studies, politics, economics and legal studies, sustainability studies, urban and critical geography and the histories of art and design. Practice: Establish an international working group on repair, reuse and maintenance, which draws together expertise from contemporary art and design, academic research and NGOs, charities and social enterprises working in the sector. Policy and legislation: Identify the necessary steps and research needs for future development of UK repair policy and legislation",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR007527%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Gift shops are a common part in most museums and galleries that provide visitors with shopping experiences (Swanson and Timothy, 2012) as well as the opportunity to transform their intangible experience (gallery/museum) visit to a tangible memory through the purchase of a souvenir (Collins-Kreiner and Zins, 2011). It can also often be shown that the 'souvenirs' stocked within these gift shops are 'inauthentic' and 'homogenized' (Boorstin, 1961), 'commodified products', 'imitations', 'deceptions' (Greenwood, 1997), 'staged' (MacCannell, 1973), 'socially constructed interpretation of the genuineness of observable things' or 'mass standardisations oriented towards the export market' (MacCannell, 1989). Errington (1998) claims that making souvenir objects solely for the mass market undermines authenticity and promotes decadence. This can have the effect of detaching the viewer from engagement with the actual heritage experience and the overproduction of globalized, unsustainable, muddled, interpretive, disposable 'cultural' mementos. However, technological innovations in design and personalization of tourist souvenirs, through 3D printing offer opportunities to escape the serial reproduction of culture through creative processes that engage the visitor in the creation of meaning. By becoming involved in the design of souvenirs, a new supply chain is created which transforms the visitor from a consumer to a co-designer and co-producer. Through this personal and emotional engagement in the production of the souvenir, visitors may assign more emotional value and attachment to the customized souvenirs.  This project proposes to offer an alternative approach to the contemporary heritage souvenir experience through the utilization of 3D scanning and printing and online, remote interfaces between the museums, galleries and heritage sites and local 3D printing facilities, without an in-between 'gift shop' provision. It proposes to provide a desirable, customizable, co-created range of products, based on scanned in versions of artifacts within the museums, galleries and heritage sites, produced remotely in the tourists nearest local 3D printing facility.","Users and beneficiaries outside the academic community will be the participating museums and galleries, other heritage and visitor attractions which will gain insights from visitors' engagement with souvenirs and their collections. Depending on the project findings, there may be implications in terms of the retail offerings in their gift shop. A report summarising the main findings of the project will be circulated to the focus group participants. Presentation of the findings in specialist annual conference and publication in practitioner or specialist association journal will ensure the findings of the projects are disseminated to these type of beneficiaries around the UK and possibly, internationally.  Third sector organisations involved in heritage management such as the National Trust may also find the findings of the project useful as they manage a number of heritage attractions across the UK and would be interested in the potential for revenue generation through retailing that the project could pinpoint.  Beneficiaries may also include private sector companies such as 3D design/printing companies or manufacturers/retailers of souvenirs, who may be interested in the findings of the projects in terms of better understanding how consumers engage with 3D printed products and identifying products and services they could offer.    Invitations to the Exhibition of produced artifacts and the process of souvenir production will be sent out to private, public and third sector organisations. Attendance of the Exhibition by these organisations may also generate opportunities to establish how to progress this study further.  Finally, the general public may also benefit from the project as they will have the possibility to engage with the 3D printed souvenirs and consider the potential of 3D printing in their daily lives. Attendance at the exhibition will be the first experience of 3D printed objects for some parts of the general public. The possibility to further disseminate the findings of the project through Edinburgh Beltane will also be explored to maximise the opportunity of public engagement.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL01386X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project focuses on harnessing the creative capacities of communities to provide transformational engagements and research production between communities and researchers: to enable (crowd sourced) co-production of heritage data.  Using photogrammetry techniques, we utilize the ubiquity of the camera (in the hands of the communities) to photograph heritage artefacts and environments that are uploaded to our server, transformed to 3D models (through an automatic and online photogrammetry server), and stored in open file formats, with metadata, and archived in the public HER of Wales, via Archwilio.  This process preserves 'by record' an archive of 2D photographs and 3D models of the heritage, metadata and their locations. Saving the data in the HER provides long-term sustainability of the data. Focusing on photogrammetry rather than laser scanning enables the co-production of the heritage archive and a broader coverage of the heritage: more objects to be scanned than would be ever possible without the community involvement, and at low cost.  We will research and develop a 'wikipedia' style moderation structure, enabling experienced users to become moderators, to authenticate and moderate the content, to create a self-moderating and self-sustaining and enduring process. This model will create ""heritage-pedians"". We will create alternative views: use 3D-printing (rapid prototyping) to generate 3D physical models of the data, and will research how to create a novel multi-touch and tangible tabletop display, that uses the 3d-printed objects as tangible input devices to manipulate and explore the table-top interaction along with multi-touch. I.e., using augmented reality code, the table will notice the presence of a tangible object and alter the content of the visualization based on the object placed on the table.  The tangible table will form the centrepiece of our exhibition, and enable the public to view and manipulate the information in a novel and exciting way, and enable researchers to discuss and explore different interpretations of the past.","As the major stakeholder in the project, the potential public impact is particularly significant, and is held to be a major aim of the programme. Beneficiaries can be divided into a series of important sub-groups, all of whom will experience potentially transformational impacts. Schoolchildren partaking in outreach activities will benefit from the educational impact of an increased or entirely new understanding of local and regional prehistoric heritage, teaching them to value their heritage, and laying the foundations for increased engagement in the future. This will be of particular importance for children from socio-economic backgrounds traditionally associated with low educational attainment and lower take-up of further education opportunities in history and the humanities. Given the community-sourced nature of the data collected for the project, it represents an opportunity for the public to engage in a truly democratic manner with their prehistoric past. Through the online sourcing of imagery and artefacts scanning workshops, individuals can decide which sites are to be recorded and digitally preserved, on the basis of what is important to them personally. Volunteers will also benefit from learning new skills and practices in heritage recording. This will foster greater engagement with the heritage of their region, with future benefits for positive stewardship of monuments by their local communities. Benefits therefore accrue for the archaeological resource as a whole. In terms of quality-of-life, through the revolutionary 3D presentation of prehistory, the project represents a unique opportunity for older people or those with mobility-based disabilities to experience heritage that is often rendered inaccessible to them, due to landscape or physical location. On the international stage, the website offers the opportunity for those of any nation to learn about the prehistoric heritage of the UK, and will present a technologically innovative and forward-looking vision of Welsh heritage, with potential impacts on regional tourism. Public bodies involved in heritage preservation and policymaking will experience significant positive impacts from the project. The RCHMW/Cadw databases will be enhanced with important 3-dimensional information on the preservation of sites for future management, in addition to the knowledge transfer potential of the photographic recording method itself, for future research or monitoring activities through the rapid recording of threatened sites. The Gwynedd Archaeological Trust (GAT) will receive a more comprehensive record of local prehistoric monuments and sites, enabling more informed local planning decisions, and a better understanding of the safety of the monuments under their oversight. The Welsh Finds scheme (run through GAT), and the public as a whole, has the potential to benefit through the 3D recording of prehistoric artefacts held by individuals, but which would otherwise remain in private collections. There is also the potential for knowledge transfer, to all these bodies, of cutting-edge online search and recording tools, and digital interoperability with their existing online databases. Museums and Museum Professionals There will also be significant impact and knowledge transfer with the museum sector. Obviously Pontio Bangor will benefit from a permanent display as an outcome of the project. The innovation centre will benefit from expert knowledge on cutting-edge interactive presentation techniques, and experience higher visitor footfall overall due to public interest in the project and the sites on display. Additional visitors attracted to local museums stand a much greater chance of visiting the same or other museums in the future, thereby contributing to the sustainability of the entire sector, and of engagement with heritage more generally.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL007916%2F1

It will focus primarily on the academic literature, but, given the nature of the field, will also review relevant policy literature. Its starting point is that much of the academic literature argues that culturally-led regeneration efforts have often failed, at least in terms of delivering the widespread social benefits that many have promised. Too often these developments have led to rising land values, rising rents and the eventual eviction of low income households, artists and even small cultural businesses. The conflicts produced by these sort of gentrification processes is well covered in existing literature. Given this, this critcal review proposes three areas for research that will take this debate in new and hopefully, fruitful directions:  1. To reconsider the idea of 'urban' in the cultural regeneration literature. Although the focus of much of the literature is on larger, urban centres; an emerging literature suggests a different, and perhaps more sustainable set of outcomes outside of these sites. What can we learn from literature on the role of culture suburbs, rural areas and small towns? What are the implications for larger cultural institutions often associated with metropolises? What cultural forms eg. craft or festivals are linked to regeneration in smaller towns and cities? What scale is most appropriate for cultural regeneration? 2. To present a global survey of the literature, which specifically seeks out work not limited to the UK and North American experience. What are the different models of urban regeneration arising in different global contexts? What are the links between urban regeneration and development in the Global South? Are there particular regional approaches eg. Latin America, that could form a distinctive approach to regeneration? 3. To consider the 'new politics of place' and its links to culture and urban regeneration. Movements such as Occupy have re-focussed attention on the importance of public space, community and conviviality, an element of cultural regeneration that has often been over-looked in the focus on new, built infrastructure. What, if anything, is the specific role for artists in this new politics? Beyond the 'flagship' building; what sort of cultural infrastructure really matters? What are the links between cultural and social movements in the new politics of place?",This section not required under the terms and conditions of the call.

The conspicuous absentee from this list is the Hebrew Bible (also known as the Old Testament), which, despite its profound impact on western civilization, has not been afforded the same treatment. Instead, scholarly editions print the text of a single manuscript from the start of the 11th century CE, over a millennium after the completion of the Hebrew Bible. An international group of scholars is addressing this desideratum by publishing The Hebrew Bible: A Critical Edition (hereafter HBCE). The proposed project will enable the completion of volumes on 1 Kings and Psalms 100-150 in this series. Each volume will contain an introduction, a critical eclectic text with critical apparatus (i.e., a critically reconstructed text that uses readings from multiple witnesses), and a commentary on the development of the text and the reasoning behind the reconstruction of the critical text. The work of textual criticism - and the task of putting together a critical edition, in particular - requires many skills, research hours, and perspectives. The traditional skill-set of the biblical text-critic includes high proficiency in at least five languages, intimate knowledge of the textual traditions transmitted in those languages, and experience in recognizing a range of known scribal practices. Recent developments in the study of textual criticism now also require the text-critic to engage a number of methodological issues with confidence, and to master sister disciplines like Hebrew linguistics, literary criticism, and Dead Sea scrolls studies. Complete mastery of the many aspects involved in producing these editions would entail a lifetime of study. To produce the best text-critical work possible, we propose a project centered on collaboration that will enable us to draw on the expertise of our colleagues around the world. The proposed project will produce critical editions of 1 Kings and Psalms 100-150 for publication with SBL Press. Given the stature of the publication series, these editions will rightly be considered the leading scholarship in textual criticism of these two texts. In addition to the printed versions of these editions, SBL Press will publish a free, online version of the data that they will maintain long past the end date of the proposed project. The project will disseminate its findings to the wider public through a series of six public forums at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, and through podcasts based on these events that will be hosted by Oxford's Educational Media Services and iTunes.","Our research findings will impact members of Jewish and Christian faith communities who value the Hebrew Bible as an important religious document. First, our research will impact modern translations, which are the main point of access that religious communities have to the Hebrew Bible. One translation in particular, the New Revised Standard Version, will be impacted by the work of our project in the next three years. Whereas modern translations of other important religious texts are based on critical editions, translations of the Hebrew Bible follow editions based on a single medieval manuscript. The task of textual criticism - deciding what text exactly to translate - has fallen to the translators themselves. After the completion of our research, future translations will have the benefit of our critical editions. The Hebrew Bible impacts millions of people worldwide through Bible translations; our work will be fundamental to continued work on these translations. Second, our research will create new knowledge about the history of the Hebrew Bible's transmission and formation. Through a series of six public forums over the three years of the project, the PI and Co-I will engage the target audience, disseminating this new knowledge and soliciting feedback on its public impact. In order to reach a broader audience, these forums will be recorded and made available as podcasts online and in Apple Podcasts. The forums will promote critical thinking about the Bible, the changing nature of its underlying Hebrew text, and the effects of text-critical evidence on modern versions of the Bible. The Hebrew Bible has had an enormous influence on the formation of the modern western world. The texts covered in our editions, 1 Kings and Psalms 100-150, include the story of King Solomon, the history of Israel during his reign, and some of the earliest and most loved poetry known to the western world. Their religious, cultural, and literary influence is widespread. New knowledge uncovered in our project pertaining to the preservation and fluidity of these texts has potential to significantly impact members of Jewish and Christian faith communities and the general public.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS001743%2F1

The research project brings together academic researchers in Archaeology, Architecture and Computer Science from the University of Sheffield, an organisation from the city's creative industry sector (Human Studio Limited design agency), and a community heritage group (Friends of Sheffield Castle). It is intended to demonstrate the capacity of immersive technologies to harness the power of cultural heritage, community engagement and the transformative potential of the creative industries to inform urban regeneration strategies and drive economic growth. The project will focus on a Sheffield case-study - the Castlegate district - long ear-marked for regeneration, and this will be used to test the potential of immersive technologies to enable regeneration. Digital technologies will be used to generate ideas for development, drawing on the heritage of the site. This is intended to engage the public with their heritage and empower community groups to work with urban planners and local government to demand imaginative regeneration. This will help to ensure its successful integration into urban living, which will increase the likelihood of the economic sustainability of regeneration initiatives. Developments sympathetic to the local heritage help to mitigate against public disengagement from their communities and ensure the economic viability of the development. How to engage the public is a huge challenge. This project will prototype the use of digital technologies to present models of the past, present and future of a site identified for regeneration and show how this can be used to generate pubic interest in the regeneration. A 3D model of Sheffield's medieval castle will be produced, drawing on current research by the Department of Archaeology, along with a version of a 3D model of the Castlegate site as it currently appears. A third element of the model would be fully developed at a later stage, informed by architectural plans for development, but in this prototype will involve the incorporation of architectural designs for the Castlegate site created recently as part of a recent student project led by the University of Sheffield's School of Architecture, and run in collaboration with the Friends of Sheffield Castle.The models will be subject to user testing by the local community to explore its value in informing plans for regeneration. These activities will foster collaborative working between a range of stakeholders interested in the future development and prosperity of the city.","This research will be of benefit to organisations in the creative industries sector, especially those developing immersive experience technologies. The ways in which organisations/individuals working in that sector can build on collaborations with academic researchers in Archaeology and Architecture will be articulated and demonstrated through the collaborative outputs. The value of the approach will appeal to local authorities/councils, by showing how immersive technologies can be utilised to engage with local communities, not only to value their heritage, but to inform plans for urban regeneration. Such bodies will also be introduced to the ways in which they may use such technologies to encourage architectural plans for urban regeneration that is sympathetic to local heritage. The research will also be of significance to architects engaged in developing plans for urban regeneration and will offer them a medium with which to incorporate the local heritage, specifically that deriving from archaeological evidence, into their designs. The research and the outputs will be of particular interest to heritage groups seeking to encourage such developments and who value their local heritage in the context of making communities. The research and its outputs will also provide a means of engaging with the wider public beyond those who are actively involved in community groups; their interest in local heritage may be high, but they may not have the time or the means to become involved in such more formal group activities. The research will also empower community heritage groups to reach out beyond their typical constituencies to effect wider engagement with local communities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR009392%2F1

A completely unknown set of six notebooks in her hand in the form of letters to a friend, discovered by Colin Jones in the Archives Nationales in Paris, provide a running commentary on France's Revolution from late 1788 through to the violent turmoil of the Terror of 1793-94. They are remarkable not only for being written from the perspective of a woman of high aristocratic status articulating overtly Counter-Revolutionary views, but also for having been composed largely at her Parisian home, the Hôtel d'Elbeuf, situated a matter of yards from the authorities running France from the Tuileries Palace complex. Above all, they are of interest as a unique critical commentary from the heart of Revolutionary Paris on the daily development of the Revolution, and especially the Terror, written at a period when politically unorthodox or Counter-Revolutionary views were increasingly being silenced - and when such statements could lead their authors to the guillotine.  The project aims to bring this extraordinary document into scholarly discussion of the Revolution and making it widely known among the general public. The first task is to provide a full transcription of the Letters: they will be published in entirety in French as a scholarly edition and select passages will also made available in English translation on an open-access online site. This effort will combine an investigation of the circumstances in which the Letters were composed, and how the manuscripts survived, with reconstructing the author's biography, and a study of the authorial voice and commentary which emerges from the text.  The Project team will then seek to diffuse knowledge of the Letters as broadly as possible so as to stimulate interest in their content and what they reveal about the French Revolution. The scholarly community will be targeted via seminars, lectures, conference talks and articles in peer-reviewed journals (besides making the Letters readily available for the first time). The team will also hope to stimulate interdisciplinary reflection on the Letters and on the Revolution more generally, notably by an international conference on the theme, 'Historical Witnessing', targeted at a literary as well as a historical audience. In addition, the Project will seek to stimulate interest in and discussion of the French Revolution among the general public and in particular among trainee historians, undergraduates and A-Level students. This will be achieved notably through an exhibition to be co-curated with the Art Museum at University College London; by making a selection of letters in English translation available on the Project website; by an H-France 'Webinar' aimed at graduate students; and by a conference aimed at A-Level teachers and students. The Blog will facilitate conversations spanning all audiences and provide a hub for promoting Project outputs. Articles placed in history trade journals such as History Today as a starting point for developing wider impact through the media. Finally, the project will enhance the development of two scholars of the French Revolution - the Co-Investigator and the Postdoctoral Research Assistant attached to the project - both at an early stage in their careers.","The French Revolution is a topic that engages a huge worldwide audience among scholars and the general public. A good deal of that interest - ranging from Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities (1859) through to the controversial 2015 Video-game, Assassin's Creed - focusses on personal experience of the Revolution, a topic which the Duchesse d'Elbeuf letter series strikingly illuminates. An unknown figure of aristocratic extraction, the eighty year-old dowager duchess maintained a running commentary on the events of the revolution from 1788 to her death in 1794. This letter series is all the more striking for expressing strong counter-revolutionary sympathies, while being written a matter of a hundred yards from the Tuileries palace complex which housed the National Assembly and then the Revolutionary Government.  ACADEMIC BENEFICIARIES of the research comprise specialists in the French Revolution in Great Britain, France and the extra-European anglophone and francophone worlds, plus more generally historians of modern Europe. The project has been designed so that the outputs will also interest specialists outside the discipline, working in eighteenth-century studies, literature, the emotions, women's writing and the epistolary form. The main peer-reviewed outputs will be an edition of the Letters published in French (an English translation will also be made available gratis online), 5 learned journal articles and an international interdisciplinary conference in London towards the end of the project. A 'Webinar' on H-France - the largest scholarly organisation for Francophone history and culture in the anglophone world, with around 3,500 members from 40 nations worldwide - will be targeted particularly at graduate students in French history. The Co-Investigator and Postdoctoral Research Assistant will also be academic beneficiaries, and the experience of organising the research and its impact will be significant in their career development, which will be under the mentorship of the PI Jones.  NON-ACADEMIC BENEFICIARIES: the research will engage with a set of activities and events designed to promote knowledge exchange between academia and the general public including schools and higher education. We anticipate these being largely but not wholly in Great Britain and the anglophone world. An exhibition is planned at the Art Museum of University College London, which drawing on its collection of French Revolutionary prints has already has staged an exhibition on the earlier part of the Revolution in 2015, which achieved impressive levels of engagement. The exhibition will focus on the Terror and the Elbeuf letters will be used as a thematic thread through the exhibition as a whole. The British Museum has kindly agreed to make loans from its own collections. In addition, an English translation of select passages totalling 10K words via a free website managed by Exeter University Digital Humanities Lab. The website will also provide space for teaching materials, aimed at an undergraduate and A-level student audience. The Project will also seek to reach student audiences through two collective events. One of these will be targeted at A-Level teachers, to encourage feedback into the project that will maximise impact among students. The second will be a conference for the schools which we have identified as teaching the French Revolution to A-Level. Finally, we plan to publish at least three articles in trade publications in history (drawn from History Today, BBC History, the Historical Association's The Historian, and the Paris-based L'Histoire). These will bridge the two communities of academic and non-academic beneficiaries. We will use publication in these journals and the exhibition in order to to trigger a wider set of approaches to media outlets, which we will pitch under advice from QMUL's and Exeter's public relations offices. A Project Blog will also facilitate dialogue between and within academic and non-academic audiences.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR013292%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The primary academic design institutions in the Bristol and Bath region (UWE, and the universities of Bath Spa and Bristol) will collaborate in order to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the value and impact of design in the region. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, the team will strive to articulate the social and economic value of design, in addition to an assessment of the nature and quality of the regional design networks. Working in collaboration with REACT, West of England Design Forum (WEDF), Bristol Media, Creative Bath and The West of England Local Enterprise Partnership (WLEP), the three universities will provide a unique knowledge base that affords a deep understanding of the distinctive nature and characteristics of design in the Bristol and Bath region. The partner institutions' design academics will also exploit their networks with other regional HEIs including Bath University (Architecture & Engineering) and the University of Gloucestershire to provide consultative input into the project. A combination of approaches and methods drawn from both the social sciences and arts and humanities will enable the project team to move beyond the raw statistical sector mapping that has occurred to date through analysing the importance of the region's unique cultural heritage, the social, historical and cultural context within which designers operate. In this way, the project will create a robust framework for the understanding and evaluation of design in the region whose finding will benefit the research councils, the government, HEIs and industry.","The impact of this research project will have wide reaching benefit for the region. A fully developed profile of design industry in the region mapping how design practice enhances broad aspects of the socio-economic landscape. Its cultural and economic analysis will be of great value to our partners, funders and regional agencies. It will provide information to cover the basic gaps in available data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), which does not currently collect comprehensive data about the design industry and occupations in the widest possible sense. The project will generate robust hard factual data and case studies that will support existing anecdotal evidence. It will have the potential inform the ways in which the ONS map the SME (small and medium enterprises) element of design industry, and design roles in the 'non-creative' industries, such as engineering and aerospace. This research will enable the region's design profile and its influence to become more visible nationally and internationally. This has the capacity to attract more design and creative-led businesses and talent to the Bristol/Bath area.    More widely, the impact of the project will directly support the vision and business development of the project partners and other related organisations in the region. For example, the LEP supports business growth of key sectors: creative and media (national lead); advanced engineering, aerospace and defense (national lead); micro-electronics and silicon design; environmental technologies and marine renewables; and tourism - all of which involve the design disciplines. It will also drive innovation and creativity and the development of new technologies, products and services in 3 main ways: People, Local Business and Place. LEP partners are working together to support: 95,000 new jobs by 2030; 3.4% annual growth by 2020; £1+ billion private sector investment over the next 3 years; well-motivated workforce with the skills business needs; and thereby provide foundations for a long-term sustainable economy. We believe that design will play a major role in the region's future development and the project will help in that process by providing accurate statistical information and a qualitative analysis of the design ecology.    The project will increase regional capacity in multidisciplinary research specifically across multiple design and business disciplines through the collaborative development of the research team (Research Fellows, Associates, Administrator), providing transferable skillsets and expertise applicable to both industry and academia. The research will also produce recommendations for a 'toolkit' document that will highlight the ways in which regional economies can establish policy, investment and planning frameworks to enhance the value in their design-led creative industries. This type of shorter action-oriented publication (typically aimed at regional policy level, LEPs, local authorities, regional investment agencies) has the capacity to provide research findings during the course of the project that could enable policymakers to make a difference by describing the value of the local design communities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM005771%2F1

This project will reimagine George Eliot's radical artistic vision of 'provincial life' in the Midlands through creative collaborations in Coventry across 2021.  There is evidence from a previous AHRC project led by PI Livesey that public interest in Eliot's life and legacy is sometimes held back by the perceived difficulty (and length) her work, but that this can be overcome through creative engagements with her work in the shape of new writing, the visual arts, and research-led social media campaigns. This project will work with diverse communities in Coventry in 2021 to retell Eliot's story and the ground-breaking literary experiment of Middlemarch, with the people living in the city which it fictionalised. The project will work with local and family history groups to build a collaborative online exhibition, telling the story of 19th century Coventry through a dozen professions and institutions that feature in the novel. The exhibition research will be in partnership with the Herbert Museum and Coventry Archives, and Nuneaton Museum and Art Gallery and be told through materials in their archives and collections. This collaboration, drawing on Livesey's expertise in literature and public engagement, will enhance the ongoing work of these museums as they develop a new interpretation strategy for their extensive collections relating to Eliot.  In order to draw fresh attention to Eliot's significance as an artistic innovator for audiences unfamiliar with her novels, Co-Investigator Olsen will work in dialogue with Livesey to research and direct an experimental short film. The film, 'Of that Roar Which Is...', will use Olsen's own poetic and filmic language to respond to Eliot's art of attention to life forms that might otherwise go unnoticed. The work will demonstrate Eliot's ongoing cultural influence of contemporary practice and draw on the physical landscape of contemporary Coventry and the collections of museum and archive partners. Building on Olsen's previous creative reinterpretations of museum collections and reputation for research-led film-making, the new film will be shown at partner museums. It will form a useful model for long-term reflections on the place of contemporary arts in reinterpreting the narratives of established collections.  The final strand of the project will bring scenes from Eliot's novel to life in three sites in central Coventry during 10 public performances in autumn 2021. Partners Dash Arts will lead devising workshops with community groups in Coventry. The participatory process will identify key themes from the novel for contemporary Coventry. Participants will be offered opportunities to take part in the professional production, supported by Warwick Arts Centre, Principal Partner in Coventry City of Culture. Founded in 2005 Dash, develops productions, events and participation projects that enhance diverse audience's understanding of other peoples and cultures through an artistic lens. 'Scenes from Middlemarch' will use Eliot's novel and Livesey's research to open out conversations with often overlooked middle of Britain through participatory devising and performances. Emphasis is likely to fall on the novel's interest in narratives of public health, and the power of bankers, exploring trust and communication in a changing community.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV010786%2F1

More specifically, this proposal is located within the RCUK's Global Uncertainties Programme (now the Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research) and particularly addresses the 'transnational organised crime' theme of the Highlight Notice.  We propose an innovative and original collaborative research network that will bring together academics, practitioners and policymakers with expertise in the areas of organised crime and corruption, and the interdependencies between these, in the context of criminal and non-criminal enterprise in domestic and international commerce in OECD countries. The Network will integrate the law and criminology research expertise of the coordinators with that of other arts and humanities disciplines (e.g. philosophy, film studies, political science/studies, economics and business) and the sciences (e.g. computational science, the information and communications technology field) and will engage with academic and non-academic participants from several jurisdictions to ensure the cross-fertilisation of knowledge and cross-cultural, comparative insights.  The substantive focus of the proposal is on (1) the social and criminal organisation of corrupt relations, practices and processes within criminal and non-criminal commercial enterprises that operate both domestically and transnationally across OECD countries, and on (2) law, theory and practice on how we can understand, predict/detect and act against/intervene with such phenomena. The proposal brings together two often discrete research areas, those of 'organised crime' and 'corruption' and is organised around three complementary streams:  - Stream I: Identifying and understanding corrupt activities within/by non-criminal commercial enterprise (i.e. corruption within/by legitimate businesses per se);  - Stream II: identifying and understanding corrupt activities within/by criminal commercial enterprise (i.e. corruption within/by formally legitimate businesses that are controlled by organised crime groups, and also corruption by/within entirely criminal entities, like drug cartels); and, - Stream III: Identifying and understanding corrupt activities at the intersections of criminal and non-criminal commercial enterprises.  It is anticipated that the research network will have notable scientific and social impact, advancing theoretical, conceptual and methodological insights into corruption in (non-)criminal commercial enterprise and having practical use for state (e.g. law enforcement agencies) and non-state (e.g. business compliance) responses. For instance, the network will result in evidence-led and practice-relevant research, informed by the needs and experiences of policymakers and practitioners, in the areas of organised crime and corruption - these are key challenges in establishing security and protecting business interests in the UK but also in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice as envisaged by the European Union. It moves beyond the traditional academic focus on discrete causes and responses, and makes new connections between economics insights, criminology, philosophy and law. It will also facilitate ideas for the development of ICT tools which may minimise corruption, informed by criminological research, cultural studies and economics.","It is anticipated that the research network will have notable scientific and social impact, advancing theoretical, conceptual and methodological insights into corruption in (non-)criminal commercial enterprise and having practical use for state (e.g. law enforcement agencies) and non-state (e.g. business compliance) responses.

It will also facilitate ideas for the development of ICT tools which may minimise corruption, informed by criminological research, cultural studies and economics.  This research network will also directly inform the UK Government's recently published (December 2014) Anti-Corruption Plan in response to the 'corruption threat' to the UK's 'national security, economic prosperity and international reputation'. According to the document, it is the Government's intention to respond to the immediate, domestic priorities by building a better picture of the threat from corruption and the ways in which the UK is vulnerable, by increasing protection against the use of corruption by organised criminals and strengthen integrity in key sectors and institutions, and strengthen the UK's law enforcement response to more effectively pursue those who engaged in corruption or launder their corrupt funds in the UK. The Plan also acknowledges the importance that the UK, as a leading financial centre, has an international responsibility to 'raise global standards, build prosperity, and promote sustainable global growth, open markets and fair access to resources'. The content discussed in the three workshops and the materials produced during and after the series of events will directly inform these priorities of the UK Government.  In light of this new Anti-Corruption Plan, this network will therefore be of interest to policymakers and practitioners working in the areas of counter-organised crime, counter-corruption, financial crimes, proceeds of crime, and procurement. Such stakeholders include the Home Office, the National Crime Agency, the Serious Fraud Office the Association of Chief Police Officers, Serious Organised Crime Task Force (Scotland) and the Organised Crime Task Force (Northern Ireland). It will also be significant for NGOs like Transparency international, Corruption Watch and Open Society Institute.  The implications for private practice of legislation like the Bribery Act 2010 and EU procurement directives mean that this network will be crucial for legal and accounting practitioners. Moreover, contemporary regulatory theory identifies the importance of responding to threats such as organised crime and corruption by incorporating non-state actors and organisations, such as the business community and industry more generally, and by implementing extra-legal mechanisms that complement criminal justice responses. This research will inform such non-state responses by providing the analytical tools and knowledge to business, including large corporations and small and medium enterprises (this links directly with the recent Select Committee Report on SMEs) so 'red flags' and vulnerabilities can be identified, prevented, disrupted and reduced. The public will benefit from the dissemination of distilled analysis of this under-explored issue.  References: HM Government (2014) UK Anti-Corruption Plan.

Although drills are informed by safety legislation and building codes, their merits are still not well-understood, and their impact on evacuation performance not well-characterized. However, they are still seen as a key component of safety planning/building certification. There are significant issues with evacuation drills, as currently executed: 1. The effectiveness of the evacuation drill model is not well understood. 2. Drills carry both an inherent risk to participants, and a significant cost (in terms of temporary loss of building functionality). 3. Sub-populations are often excluded from drills (e.g., those with medical issues, or mission-critical staff), which affect the potential for training and assessment. However, the availability of new approaches/technologies such as augmented/virtual reality, computational simulation, smart sensors, building intelligence and video analytics means that we have an unprecedented opportunity to enhance the way that we plan, deliver and analyze the results of evacuation drills or complementary activities. This allows us to disentangle the training benefits and assessment of drill effectiveness, following a case-control approach comparable to research practices in evidence-based medicine - pushing towards evidence-based evacuation drills. Here, we explore new technologies, methodologies and perspectives to (a) enhance the training component of evacuation drills (ED), (b) improve the analysis and interpretation of their results, and (c) reduce both short-term risk to participants and operational disruption. NEED will establish a consortium of experts in evacuation dynamics, fire safety, immersive tech, data science, artificial intelligence, and computational simulation, to focus on these questions: 1. What are the main training limitations of current ED? 2. What are the main assessment limitations of current ED? 3. How do these limitations vary across the buildings and populations that are subject to ED? 4. What are the alternative approaches for drill training and assessment? 5. What are the major benefits of the alternative approaches identified? How can they be quantified? 6. What are the challenges (regulatory, public perception, technical, cost etc.) in adopting such alternatives? 7.

Piloted through 2018-2021, and supported with initial AHRC iDAH funding in 2021, it has continued to bring iDAH further towards inclusion of heritage and IRO research. Developments in the previous 12 months have improved functionality for users, branding options for partners, and metadata. During that period, conversations with other IROs about future use of the shared repository and bringing their research into the platform have brought them closer towards on boarding, and our interviews to understand how to meet needs beyond the IRO Consortium have identified the next steps to further strengthen open data and scholarship across UK heritage research. Now IROs understand the future of iDAH, more organisations are keen to move towards set up. Further effort is now required over the next 12 months to continue improving the repository service, ramp up the inclusion of partner organisations and deliver vital skills development to IRO colleagues in support of increased use of repository services, and key competencies for open scholarship. The Shared Repository Service will allow for adherence to Open Access and data sharing mandates, while providing institution-specific front-end repositories to heritage organisations with nationally- and internationally-recognised brands, allowing partners to showcase the research produced by their expert staff. This research is produced through business-as-usual activity, as well as from collaborative research projects, and other activity such as artist in residence programmes. The British Library's Shared Repository Service aggregates that research content across partners to make participation a collective activity that increases the visibility of heritage research from across the UK.

"Funding details                                                                                                              Slavery is an issue of absorbing concern in today's society, as evidenced by the increasing number of news stories about trafficking and forced labour, many of them on our own doorsteps. It is estimated that there are 30 million slaves in the world today, a figure roughly equivalent to 50 per cent of the UK's population. Yet it is one thing to identify this problem, another to do something about it. The current project speaks to the need to create a modern anti-slavery movement and, as a first step, to educate our children about slavery, in both its historical and contemporary forms. To that end, the aim of the proposed engagement activity is to devise an educational package (songs, music, lesson plans, DVD) and a parallel music event for public performance, as a means of introducing school children and the wider public to the scale and complexity of slavery, as well as to the life experiences of those caught in its grip, past and present. The model here is 'Cargo', which was written and composed by Paul Field in 2007 with input from members of the Wilberforce Institute for the study of Slavery and Emancipation (WISE) at the University of Hull. The success of 'Cargo', which has been seen by over 70,000 people in the UK, France, Holland and the USA, demonstrates that quite complex ideas about slavery and abolition can be conveyed through music and drama.  The current proposal, 'Child Cargo', draws on the knowledge and expertise of the same creative artists, principally Paul Field, as well as the expertise of schoolteachers and researchers at WISE. As a first step, the project team will need to decide on content and choose appropriate themes and subject matter. This will necessarily involve a series of workshops involving all of the team members -- who will also seek the assistance of interested parties, including teachers and members of community groups (e.g. Hull Black History Partnership, Hull Freedom Festival). It is expected that most of the content consultation will be concentrated into this first phase of the project, which will take up to three months to complete. Thereafter, the emphasis will shift to the creative element of the project: writing songs, developing visuals, consultation with teachers, and, finally 'road testing' the end result at Hull's Freedom Festival in September 2015. By its very nature, this is a collaborative project, involving those working within and without higher education institutions. WISE already has established links with local schools in Hull and surrounding region. It also has close links with local community groups and with museums and archives, including the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool and the National Maritime Museum in London. We have already consulted widely with these groups and with the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), Anti-Slavery International and Stop The Traffik, who have become Project Partners to add their expertise and weight to the enterprise.  In developmental terms, we are able to draw on the expertise of digital media staff within the University of Hull (Scarborough) and across the University as a whole. The University of Hull is the lead institution in the AHRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Heritage. The management team will therefore have access to experts in museums and heritage interpretation, public engagement and the more than 70 international heritage organizations of the CDT. Similarly, members of WISE have links with Hull's Freedom Festival, which regularly attracts an audience of 80,000, and have been involved in the University's contribution to Hull City of Culture 2017. The project will therefore support the development of the comprehensive approach needed to raise awareness of modern slavery and to maximise impact from the completed research and this follow-on proposal.","The proposal meets the following pathways to impact: enhancing the knowledge economy, improving teaching and learning, improving social welfare and social cohesion, enhancing cultural enrichment and quality of life, and increasing public engagement with research and related societal issues. WISE already has an active outreach programme, working closely with a number of local schools on projects related to Black History Month and Holocaust Education. With Hull City Council the Institute is also actively involved in a project that sends local schoolteachers to Sierra Leone and that brings African teachers to Hull. As a result, WISE is ideally placed to maximise the impact of the proposal, certainly within Hull and surrounding region. At the same time, WISE has links with major international museums, including the National Maritime Museum, and has experience of developing educational packages aimed at schoochildren, the most recent example being the Contemporary Slavery Resource, which was developed in collaboration with the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool and the UNESCO International Slave Routes Project. WISE is also a successful conference centre, offering a regular programme of seminars and conferences on historic and contemporary slavery. Plans for a Teachers' Institute are already well advanced. It is the intention to use all of these contacts to publicise 'Child Cargo' and to ensure that it reaches the widest audience possible. It is also important to mention here the success of a DVD/package on the American slave Venture Smith, again developed in collaboration with colleagues in WISE, which has been distributed to over 800 schools in the state of Connecticut, USA. As already mentioned, the project team proposes to work closely with the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, involving them in both the developmental stages of the project but also in its marketing. Kevin Bales' contact with Walk Free and other anti-slavery organizations, including Anti-Slavery International, will also prove useful in terms of national marketing, as will WISE's contacts with local MPs, among them Diana Johnson. For all of these reasons, we believe that WISE is uniquely placed to ensure that the proposal has maximum impact. To that end, it will be one of the key responsibilities of Dr Nigel Shaw to liaise with these different groups and to devise an effective and comprehensive commercialisation strategy for 'Child Cargo', so as to put in place future pathways to impact with schools, musuems, UKHTC/Serious Crime Division, Comic Relief and other NGO partners. We should also mention two other important local pathways to impact. One of these in Hull's annual Freedom Festival, which attracts 80,000 people each year. WISE has close links with the Freedom Festival and the Director sits on its Advisory Board. The other pathway is Hull City of Culture 2017. WISE has been at the forefront of the University's contribution to 2017, particularly the 'freedom' theme, which will form an important part of the year-long programme of events. The Freedom Festival provides an obvious opportunity for us to trial 'Child Cargo' in September 2014, while 2017 offers a further opportunity to introduce it to national and international audiences. We are fully aware of these opportunitires and through our contacts with Freedom Festival and Hull City of Culture 2017 we feel confident that we can deliver on them. Finally, there is the potential here to run a series of workshops or day conferences on the making of 'Child Cargo' and school activities with the Cargo performers to explore slavery, captivity and liberation. Again, Dr Shaw will take responsibility for following up on these opportunities, as he will for developing a clear marketing stragety for the project. Given the nature of this proposal, we will need to be energetic, proactive and innovative in developing pathways to impact but feel that we have right team to do so.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM004937%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Music has always been highly mobile and musicians have been crossing cultural and physical borders for centuries, both voluntarily and as a result of inhospitable ideological, economic and environmental forces in their homelands. This project investigates the relationships that develop between migrants and their adopted host society, and how they manifest in their own creativity, each crucial to evaluating the cultural impact of migration. However, our understanding of the role of mobility and migration in shaping musical culture as a whole is as yet limited. This project brings fresh methodological approaches to the study of the experiences, musical lives and subsequent impact on British musical culture of musicians who came from Nazi-ruled Europe in the 1930s and '40s. Many of them went on to make major contributions to the successful reinvigoration of art music in the ensuing decades. The project will investigate and map the journeys and careers of approximately 30 musicians as they negotiated and helped to form aspects of British musical life in the post-war period as influential teachers, composers and performers, and in major institutions such as opera houses, the BBC, and higher education. It will explore how musical skills, traditions and values were transported and exchanged, and how these interactions affected the migrants themselves, local musicians, and public musical life at large. The project also probes the practical challenges of performing and mediating their compositions-which are defined by multiple trans-national cultural influences and traditions-through a programme of experimental open rehearsal workshops. Selected works by migrant musicians that for various reasons have remained hidden will be explored by professional and student musicians, and contemporarily relevant approaches to their presentation in performance will be tested in public. Through practice-based research, we aim to bring a fresh dimension to conventional musical analysis, highlighting the cultural value of this music for contemporary audiences interested in its broader historical context.  The project includes a structured programme of research in a dozen major archives in the UK, Germany and Austria pertaining to this history, and in particular two key institutions, Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the Anglo-Austrian Music Society in London, both critical in different ways to the impact of this group of migrants on the shaping of post-war British music. Archival and historical research combined with images, oral history interviews and recorded performances will form the basis for the creation of a series of on-line 'story maps' that use geo-visualisation software to present multi-perspective narratives combining text, images, video and audio, and dynamic links to a host of relevant additional resources. From the start of the project we aim to facilitate dialogues between scholars and artists working within the context of mobility and migration today. The project team will develop a theoretical understanding of the relationship between musical cultures, mobility and migration that can benefit future research. A symposium co-hosted by the Austrian Cultural Forum will set out the scope and direction of a cross-disciplinary debate; a series of scholarly journal articles by the PI, Co-Is and RAs will develop specific themes; and an international conference co-hosted by the German Historical Institute will extend debate to other examples of music, migration and mobility. Public exhibitions at three partner institutions will complement the project's website, which will integrate the c.30 story maps, institutional case-studies, videos of workshops, performances and oral history interviews, textual commentary, and free-to-download music editions into a rich resource for the benefit of school students, musicians, educators and scholars who wish to find new approaches to our culture, characterised as it is by migration and mobility.","'Music, Migration and Mobility' provides new routes to the education of the public about the role of migrants in the formation of British post-war arts and culture, its values and politics, and the ways they can be understood in the context of broader historical and social narratives. While knowledge of the contributions of a number of highly-talented and entrepreneurial musicians to the formation of some of the most prominent British musical institutions, as well as their own artistic achievements as composers and performers are of particular interest to music historians, performers and music-lovers, they also have a far wider potential impact on narratives concerning migration, mobility and national culture in general, with the potential to effect positive changes to the understanding and perception of the roles that migrants have played, and continue to play in British society. The project benefits a variety of non-academic publics, including:  Visitors to its website, public exhibitions and events interested in the experiences of refugee musicians from Nazi Europe, and those of migrant artists in general, their impact on Britain's cultural institutions and native artistic practitioners, and the ways that narratives of migration might be differently constructed.  Secondary school students and their teachers: the project's online resources will inform the teaching of history, human geography, citizenship, performing arts, religious, and social studies at GCSE and A level. The online story maps, oral history interviews, archival materials, images and text commentaries can be used directly or as supporting resources for learning and teaching, providing context to broader political and historical narratives, provoking reflections on students' and teachers' own experiences of, and attitudes to migration.   Musicians, both amateur and professional will benefit from a significant quantity of new chamber repertoire, both directly during its practical dissemination in workshops, recordings and public performances, and in the form of professionally produced scores and recordings freely available through the website. These will extend and enrich their knowledge of, and access to a segment of post-war British repertoire for various small ensemble formations, currently little-known today.  Concert goers, and viewers of on-line videos of workshops, performances and free-to-stream studio audio recordings. Associated commentary and additional programme materials will contextualize the musical performances and serve both to enhance enjoyment of the music and inform listeners' understanding of the impact of mobility on post-war British music.  Concert promoters, broadcasters, UK and international cultural institutions. The online story maps, archival materials and biographical information, coupled with the recordings of public performances will stimulate richer understanding of the importance of 'British' music composed by migrants, which can have an impact on the future representation of such music and its contextualization, potentially stimulating the development of new presentation formats.  Civil society bodies that support migrants and others working to construct alternative narratives about the impacts of migration on national culture will be able to draw on the resources provided. There will be an open invitation for them to propose further links to be included in the digital resources and to offer feedback through the website and social media platform.  Curators and archivists at the project's partner organisations and other collections will benefit from the detailed research into their holdings, which will impact on both improved service to scholars, and the education of the general public through special exhibitions and talks.  We will measure impacts on each of these beneficiary groups by soliciting public responses to, and analysing uptake of on-line materials through social media and Google Analytics reports.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS013032%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Between the 1830s and 1920s over 1.3 million Indians migrated as indentured labourers to locations across the world. Criticised both at the time and since as a 'new system of slavery', this 'first wave' of Indian labour migration has been negatively portrayed as the cynical exploitation of a passive Indian labour force. Those who migrated have been presented as the victims of colonial coercion and dupes of unscrupulous middle men, who exhibited no role in the decision making process, and no influence over their individual or collective outcomes. As a result nineteenth-century Indian labour mobility has often been regarded as qualitatively different to, and disconnected from, a 'second wave' of voluntary, skilled Indian migration, beginning in the 1950s, which is often regarded as the 'legitimate' root of the modern day Indian Diaspora. This project sets out to dispute such assumptions by seeking to understand nineteenth-century indentured labour migration around the Indian Ocean in the context of a longer and more diverse history of Indian labour mobility. By situating indentured labour alongside the contemporaneous migrations of soldiers, slaves and service providers from the Indian subcontinent, it will explore the extent to which existing networks, connections and communities helped to shape the processes and experiences of indenture. Drawing upon previously misinterpreted or under-utilised resources in India, Britain, France, Mauritius, Réunion, Sri Lanka and South Africa - including the personal correspondence of migrants themselves - it will assess the degree to which indentured labourers were able to make conscious and informed decisions about if, when and where to migrate. It will also explore the ways in which migrant labourers in the Indian Ocean were able to improve their status and renegotiate real or imposed identities by moving between different categories of labour, and how far they could utilise kinship and other networks to take control of the sources of labour supply. Convict indents, emigration certificates, ship registers and migrants' letters will be used to suggest a broader and more varied movement of Indians overseas than has hitherto been realised. By tracing the vitally important continuities and interconnections between different forms of labour migration, and placing migrant agency, experiences and outcomes at the centre of the analysis, this project will explore the processes of migration in a way that goes beyond the reproduction of conventional colonial and nationalist tropes of indentured victimhood, exploitation and abuse. Instead it will offer a new approach to the migrant experience that seeks to understand the impetuses and consequences of migration from a subaltern perspective, opening up possibilities for radically reinterpreting the nature and importance of migrant agency in the early formation of the Indian Diaspora.","In rethinking the nature and origins of nineteenth-century Indian labour migration, the proposed research will be of interest to a range of non-academic users, such as: public history organisations interested in labour, migration, and globalisation; communities and interest groups concerned with the 'roots' of the modern Indian diaspora; and individuals tracing personal family histories. The project team will both build on existing connections with relevant communities, groups and institutions, and develop new links during the course of the project to bring their findings to a wide audience outside academia. They will be supported in this by a the Centre for South Asian Studies Scotland (http://www.csas.ed.ac.uk), the Edinburgh India Institute (http://www.edinburgh-india-institute.ed.ac.uk), and the University of Leeds' Arts Engaged programme, (http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/homepage/343/impact_and_innovation).  Collaboration will be a key element of the dissemination and impact strategy, and will include public events (lectures/workshops), and the provision of informational materials (pamphlets, work sheets, display materials). A number of key partners have already been identified, including the National Library of Scotland, the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation (WISE, Hull) and Wilberforce House Museum, the Bernie Grant Arts Centre and Marcus Garvey Library (London). Discussions with local and national history societies will form an important ongoing part of the research process and will shape the nature of the impact activities undertaken. These will include the Thoresby Society (Leeds); The Raphael Samuel History Centre (London), the British Black and Asian Studies Association (BASA, London), Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation (WISE, Hull), Black History Month and the Historical Association.  The project's main non-academic output will be a public facing website hosting a range of resources. As well as a blog providing regular project updates, there will be primary sources, images, maps, contextual material, short articles, bibliographies, useful links and section specifically aimed at schools. The latter will contain 'discussion packs' suitable for use in a classroom setting, and ideas and guidance for micro-research projects.  An online database of names of labour migrants in the Indian Ocean will also be created. This will be suitable for use in genealogic research and will be publicised through specific Indian Ocean genealogical web groups such as 'Imaugen. Cercle de Généalogie Maurice-Rodrigues' (bilingual, English/French) and 'GenBourbon. Cercle Généalogique de Bourbon' (French), as well as by contributions to relevant threads and lists on websites such as www.ancestry.com.  The project will target particular media outlets relating to Diaspora Indians, such as Sunrise radio station and Mauritius Now radio, and newspapers such as Mauritius Now and Mauritius News, with whom Carter has established connections. Publicity for the project will be sought through the non-academic press, including the Sunday supplements of major newspapers, Times Higher Education Supplement, Times Literary Supplement, BBC History Magazine, History Today etc.  Given the resonances between this project and current debates about child labour, migrant labour contracts (e.g. in the Gulf) and people-trafficking, especially with regard to issues such as participation, agency and opportunity, the project's findings may also be relevant to public, NGO and governmental policy. Articles on www.historyandpolicy.org, and dialogue with organisations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Anti-Slavery.org will explore this possibility.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM004910%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Asset based community development (ABCD) is a powerful approach being used with a diverse network of communities and community organizations across the Connected Communities programme to help uncover and utilize their hidden potential, their tangible resources (such as spaces, services and infrastructures) and intangible qualities (such as creative talents, skills, knowledge and social capital). Asset mapping has been deployed as a community engagement, research methodology and co-design tool seeking to enable groups to communicate stories, concerns and achievements but also to generate a shared vision and identify areas for development (personal, economic, environmental, cultural and social). Through a combination of discussion methods with creative techniques (participatory cartography, filmaking, visual art and storytelling, gaming, digital media and theatre performance), asset mapping has been used to trigger creative responses as well as creatively document, visualize and enable collective action, which could potentially improve the livelihoods of groups and communities, their spaces, services and environments.  In this context, the scope and possible meanings of 'mapping' drives central effort into the understanding of the different modes of exploration and representation of, and engagement with, communities. A number of questions direct this: What are the different meanings of mapping? What types of assets are captured by different approaches? What are the social, cultural, psychological, ethical, logistical contexts involved in different asset mapping approaches? How can we creatively analyse and reflect on insights gained from asset mapping methodologies? How can the different asset based methodology be communicated, expressed and represented more effectively to enhance their availability as a resource to the wider community?  It is thus necessary to develop knowledge that comes from comparison, collaborative reflection and evaluation, and, cross-pollination of approaches, and, to develop useful methods and strategies form meaningful analysis, as well as representation and dissemination that will advance academic research, community practice and policy debates. Our collaboration and approach in this project is unique in that it seeks to advance the exchange of perspectives adopted by the different approaches and to promote an agenda for the evaluation of asset mapping across the humanities, arts and social sciences, both as a research methodology and as a co-design/coproduction tool supporting collective/community engagement and action.  Our collaboration brings together Connected Communities projects from the Open University and the Royal College of Art, and the Universities of Keele, Leicester and Brunel and community partners The Glass-House, Young Vic Theatre and Atenistas Group in Greece. Our methodologies have tapped into narrative and theatre, cultural animation and digital story-telling, group discussion and creative visualisation, participatory chartography and game-playing and brings together philosophical perspectives from American Pragmatism, design studies and informatics, community media and citizen journalism, and fields of action in relation to placemaking and neighbourhood planning, creative networks and volunteerism. The project's innovative mode of delivery includes sharing knowledge and resources among existing CC projects through - field research trips, knowledge exchange with other research projects and experiential workshops where we will co-design approaches for exploring the application of asset mapping in wider and transnational contexts. We will disseminate our findings in workshops, through a visual website and collaborative report and will feed our lessons into the teaching curricula of the seven universities taking part in the project. Our ultimate aim is to develop the meaningful syntheses, processes and tools around asset mapping approaches that can be sustained and developed.","The impact strategy of this project is tightly intertwined with its research aims and objectives. The project's aims are three-fold: a) to develop a network of community-academic partnerships engaged in asset mapping approaches, within and outside the CC programme, b) to creatively and collectively map and reflect upon the different asset mapping approaches deployed by existing projects, and c) to co-design asset mapping approaches by acting upon existing challenges and opportunities. The identified beneficiaries of the project are local communities and communities of interest, community-based organizations, research institutions, individuals working with communities and policy makers. The project activities and insights are expected to have impact on the social, economic and cultural making of communities in the UK and Greece, on the innovation capacity of community-based organizations and on policy-making.  We have engaged with representatives of direct beneficiaries (project partners) from the start to prepare the proposal in order to ensure that our project will deliver useful and practical outcomes that fit their needs. Our UK community partners are The Glass-House with an experience in working with communities engaged in design and placemaking and The New Vic Theatre with an extensive track record on working with communities that are marginalised. Moreover, our international community partners are Atenistas an open community of citizens organising local actions for transforming cities with local interventions. Community representatives from communities of place and/or communities of interest will be also identified from seven Connected Communities projects and two related research projects. The activities proposed (field trips, reflective synthesis, co-designing new applications of asset mapping) will lead to the development of a shared understanding of the conditions under which the different tools, methods and contexts can be communicated and represented. This will allow the application of asset mapping approaches in the practice of community organizations and/or build the capacity for a more diversified and informed offering of asset based approaches. It has been postulated that our community partners will benefit for learning on 'how to' apply certain asset-based approaches but also understand their implications and conditions of use. Ideas from this shared understanding will also be cross-fertilised, and further expanded by testing the applicability of various approaches to different contexts in Greece, while learning from the different approaches to mapping and cultural engagement in that context.  In sum expected areas of impact are to: 1. Provide practical and analytical guidelines for academics who engage with local communities and community based organisations 2. develop further effective methods for capturing community level ideas, stories and assets, to improve targeted and sustainable action development by non-profit and supporting organizations  3. Develop public outputs from community achievements and encourage sustained community engagement with academics through co-learning persistent knowledge sharing  4. Contribute to debates about public connection and regeneration by providing a showcase platform and forum for academics, local community groups and community based organisations (CBOs) 5. improve teaching curriculum in areas of design innovation and informatics, community studies, media and communications, management, cultural geography and research methodology. The deliverables are intertwined with the delivery of the research activities. Data collection, analysis and reflections about the impact of the project are will be communicated in a final report, in a conference paper and in an end of project event. All other activities will be communicated in the project's and community partner's websites.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013363%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              When excavators dug al-Bahnasa, some 200 km south of Cairo, they found the rubbish dumps of ancient Oxyrhynchus, with 500,000 fragments of papyrus books and documents, mostly in Greek. This random archive materializes the Greek colonial class which effectively governed Egypt from Alexander the Great to the Arab conquest. About 10% of the papyri come from books, among them classical Greek authors whose work disappeared in whole or part during the Middle Ages: the songs of Sappho, the comedies of Menander, the elegies of Callimachus, all famous in their time. The remainder comprises public and private documents: edicts, tax-assessments, tax-returns, census-forms, property-registers, sales, leases, loans, receipts, wills, marriages, shopping-lists, household accounts and many private letters, spanning mostly the first seven centuries AD, when Egypt was a province of the Roman and Byzantine Empires.   The sorting, decipherment and publication of this material continues, and the results constitute a unique resource for scholars in various disciplines. Historians of classical literature get access to vanished libraries, which have recently yielded (for example) poems by Archilochus and Simonides; they can also study reading-habits and local litterateurs, the history of the book and the development of education. For the Roman historian, the documents come much closer to the ground than the literary sources, which focus on high politics. Official diaries record the day-to-day activity of officials. Court records show the cohabitation of Roman and local law. Land-leases and donkey-sales hint at levels of inflation. Private letters illustrate the grass-roots economy, the networks of family and friends, the Greek language assuming its modern form. Both books and documents chronicle Egyptian Christianity: persecution and establishment, uncanonical gospels and doctrinal strife, personal devotion in prayers and amulets.  In this new phase of the project we propose to publish 300 unedited papyri, chosen for their special contribution to the cultural and political history of the Roman and early Byzantine world. We will publish early papyri of an uncanonical Gospel, of the Greek Old Testament and of patristic texts, which exemplify the reading habits and doctrinal evolution of the primitive church: among them, fragments in Greek and in Coptic of the widely popular 'Shepherd of Hermas'. We have identified literary texts of works and authors long lost, to include fragments of Simonides and of unknown comedies, novels and historians, like 'Kalligone and the Amazons' and an anonymous 'Alexander and his successors'; and also of known authors (Thucydides, Apollonius Rhodius) whose text can be improved by the very early copies in our collection. A group of school exercises and grammars will document the intellectual formation of the provincial elite, from elementary schooling to oratorical mastery. Documentary texts have been chosen to illuminate the relations between Egypt, its grandees and its population, and the Emperor and his regime. So, a Prefect of Egypt stands accused of corruption before the Emperor Hadrian; a shield-shaped placard was once carried in procession to celebrate an imperial anniversary; further papers from the archives of the Apion family highlight the local barons whom Byzantine Emperors had to coopt and control. Add the drawings, now assembled for the first time, which range from simple doodles to illustrated books, from architectural blueprints to textile-designs: an Infant Horus in the Primal Egg illustrates Greco-Egyptian religion, an Angel with Black Boots reflects Christian iconography.  Empire and Late Antiquity, in all their complex reality, have left a paper-trail in the dumps of Oxyrhynchus, and this is the trail that our project will be following.","Greece and Rome are not dead: new information accrues all the time (excavations, inscriptions, papyri). Our Project will diffuse virgin material, a chosen group of new papyri. The first beneficiaries will be specialists, but we seek also to spread our enthusiasm to a more general constituency. The success of Peter Parsons' book on Oxyrhynchus, 'City of the Sharp-nosed Fish' (now translated into six European languages), suggests a wide audience in waiting.  The Oxyrhynchus project has always been a British enterprise, but it recruits expert contributors Europewide and beyond, offering a platform for inter-cultural communication that goes beyond academic collaboration. Its publications impact on a whole range of Mediterranean studies.  The papyri will be published in five annual volumes: at each stage we shall enter the basic texts and translations into the Duke DataBank of Documentary Papyri and the nascent Digital Corpus of Literary Papyri (Heidelberg/New York), which ensure immediate electronic circulation. The Project's substantial web-presence will be maintained also through collaboration with the Imaging Papyri Project, which will host digital images of the papyri as they reach publication (http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy).   Our papyri provide the backbone for the training of students in papyrology, but their appeal extends beyond tertiary education: they offer a unique worm's-eye view of Greco-Roman culture in its local setting. Schools and Continuing Education programmes engage with the material: we shall continue to respond by giving talks (with original papyri) and hosting visits to the collection. Thus pupils studying Classical Civilisation will encounter at first hand documents written in the ancient languages, which may encourage them to learn the languages themselves.   We shall continue to make available material for the citizen science enterprise 'Ancient Lives'. This puts images online and encourages anyone interested to try their hand at decipherment and to submit the results electronically to the organisers. The site claims more than 925, 000 users, and some results (checked and written up by professionals) will fuel our publications.  We shall reach a wider public by promoting events and exhibitions that highlight the new material included in this application. We plan lectures and panels for a general audience, on the lines of 'Pulp Fiction' (British Academy, Feb. 2015). The exhibition 'One God' (British Museum, Nov. 2015) will showcase one of our new drawings, as well as six published items; we are negotiating to lend further unpublished drawings to an exhibition at the Uffizi Gallery (in planning); we shall ourselves mount an exhibition of biblical and patristic texts for the Patristic Congress of 2017 (Oxford).   Individual papyri often allow appealing glimpses of real life: thus P.Oxy. 5209, in which a boy wrestler contracts to throw his match for a fee, made headlines on the BBC World Service and as far away as Der Spiegel and Fox News. We include in this application a selection of comparable papyri, each of which forms the centrepiece of a wider story about ancient society: Christian origins, women's life and literacy, magic and anxiety, Egypt and its arts. In tandem with research and publication we shall systematically promote public interest in these finds through press releases via the press offices of our Universities and of the Egypt Exploration Society and the British Academy, and in regular briefings for the AHRC's own website and channel.   The rubbish of Oxyrhynchus has its own strange glamour, still felt when a public event (actors and papyrologists) celebrated the 25th anniversary of Tony Harrison's Trackers of Oxyrhynchus (Nov. 2013). Most recently, Jenny Saville's exhibition 'Oxyrhynchus' (2014) shows artwork inspired by the vision of piled up paper. We shall seize any chance to build on this appeal.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM011313%2F1

"Funding details                                                                                                              Human rights violations involving corporations are reported more frequently in public media and have been the subject of a growing number of civil litigation and human rights cases in the courts. However, there remains an accountability gap in international law as it is applied to corporations, since states remain the primary duty holders. One consequence of this is that businesses that are involved in human rights violations generally cannot be held accountable in human rights courts for those violations.  In June 2011, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution which emphasises that transnational corporations and other business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights. This resolution established a Working Group to report to the UN Secretary General and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Working Group will be charged with looking at how best to implement the United Nations Framework for Business and Transnational Corporations. There is currently a related but separate set of discussions at the level of international law which proposes to include non-state actors (including businesses) as duty holders in human rights law.  This research seeks to contribute practical ideas about how new forms of restitution and redress for corporate human rights violations might be developed. It proposes to draw upon the experience of senior officials and judges in two of the leading international/human rights courts to explore the feasibility and desirability of developing new mechanisms for dealing with corporate human rights violations. The research will gather the views and experiences of those key experts in human rights law in two days of workshop discussions that will explore how the law might be developed appropriately to deal with corporate human rights violations. The information that is gathered at those workshops and the data recorded will then be analysed and presented in an academic article and in a briefing that will be circulated in international and human rights courts, in the relevant departments of the United Nations and other international political organisations, and in major NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. A second academic article will report on the value of using this approach for developing innovative ideas for political and legal change in other research projects.","The proposed research is designed to maximise the impact upon the development of international law and the institutions responsible for the administration and implementation of international law. Participants will benefit from participation in the workshops through meeting other professionals who are seeking to understand the development of this aspect of human rights law. Beyond this immediate, and relatively small group of beneficiaries, the proposed research will impact significantly upon the following user groups. 1) International Courts and Law Commissions (including the European Court of Human Rights, Inter-American Court of Human Rights; Inter-American Commission of Human Rights; African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights; African Commission of Human and Peoples' Rights). Those users of the research findings will benefit from having an informed, practically focused set of proposals for the reform of the law that will be consistent with the general direction of proposals on the development of an international human rights court (a discussion of those proposals can be found in the attached case for support).  2) Communities and groups most affected by non-human rights compliant business activity will benefit from the prospects of opening up new mechanisms of redress that are firmly based in principles of international law. 3) The business community (including international and transnational business organisations and international business associations). Business organisations are likely to benefit from the search for a meaningful normative framework in the sense that such mechanisms will improve socially responsible planning and will help minimise the harmful impacts of business upon communities. Business organisations are also likely to benefit considerably from the legal clarity that such reforms will bring. The development of new mechanisms for dealing with corporate human rights abuses raises ethical standards of business generally and levels the playing field for business actors that are generally compliant with human rights law. The longer term benefits will be realised in encouraging sustainable economic growth and political stability. 4) International Political Organisations In so far as the proposed research seeks to develop practical mechanisms that have remained a concern to the UN Human Rights Council and its predecessor Commission since the 1980s, culminating in the establishment of a new UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights (see attached case for support for a discussion), the proposed research will provide some impetus to those debates, and contribute to the work of the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights. The debates have reached into the Council of Europe, the Organisation of American States and the African Union, organisations that are also likely to be interested in the findings of the research.  5) NGOs and their constituents are likely to benefit from the development of mechanisms that address key concerns of organisations such as Oxfam, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The issue of business involvement in human rights has been a core concern of those NGOs, amongst many others, over the past 15 years. The impact upon those beneficiaries will be realised through the dissemination strategy set out in the 'Pathways to Impact' attachment.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FJ011657%2F1

The Art and Design research centre at Sheffield Hallam University has a rich tradition of design research and practice spanning over 20 years. Over the last 5 years this expertise has been brought to bear on the complex and hitherto untapped potential of design in Health and social care. This critical mass of work has been centred around two specific collaborations within the research centre. Firstly Lab4Living, which is a partnership between researchers in health and design, between practitioners and designers and, most importantly between individuals who use products and services and the designers of these (www.lab4living.org.uk). Secondly the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) funded User-centred Healthcare Design (UCHD). UCHD is another multidisciplinary project specifically exploring the use of design theory and practice in healthcare (www.uchd.org.uk). These collaborations have resulted in the International Design4Health conference being held in 2011 and 2013 (http://www.design4health.org.uk/) This conference and associated activities have provided an excellent focus for the discussion around the translation of design research into healthcare and have linked business, university and third sectors around a bewildering array of projects. The conversations around the key challenges for this area of design have started in this forum, but the AHRC funding would allow a literature review and a series of seminars to explore the key themes identified at the close of the last conference, namely: Languages of evaluation across design and health projects How to articulate Design's unique contribution to the field of healthcare innovation The range of modes of engagement with health care that designers can have The first stage of the proposed project would be to commission a comprehensive literature review to determine the range and amount of activity already underway in the UK and internationally in design for health. This would provide a sound evidence base for the second phase of the work. The conference steering committee already has excellent representation from across the UK design academic landscape, who alongside those with experience of Healthcare and Health research, would be able to start to frame and then answer the questions, and ground the answers in the practical experience of delivering projects. The latter part of the project will translate the outputs of the literature review and workshops into an engaging digital form of dissemination All of these activities will have a natural outlet in the Design4Health conference 2015.","As the AHRC's call describes the range of beneficiaries of such work is broad, and in health and social care it is broader still as we look at the potential benefit to service delivery and patient experience. The work showcased by the unique Design4Health conference has the potential to inform both policy and practice. There are unique challenges for healthcare and design is often sighted as having the potential to offer up the radical solutions required to address these needs. Where there is less written is around the actual practicalities of how to work in this challenging environment. This proposal will determine the 'state of the art' of design in health. It will identify from peer-reviewed literature the areas where there is a critical mass of research and highlight areas where further research is required. By engaging those at the cutting edge of design research practice we will be able to critically frame the questions realised by the literature review and propose the research questions that will move the discipline forward.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013908%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Conspiracy theories are increasingly rife on the Internet. With their potential for spreading virally, they can reach large audiences across the globe. In their relentless drive to connect the dots into one over-arching explanation, conspiracy theories seem to be made for the hyperlinked world of the Internet. Once marginal ideas now readily find an online community of believers. Although conspiracy theories encountered online are at times merely harmless entertainment or a sign of healthy scepticism, they can also lead to a loss of faith in scientific authorities and expert knowledge, to political disengagement, and even to violence. This research project addresses the question of how and why the Internet has changed conspiracy theories. Combining the 'close reading' techniques of cultural studies and ethnography with the 'distant reading' possibilities offered by big data methods, the project will analyse the difference that the Internet has made to the production, aesthetics and consumption of conspiracy theories. The team brings together cultural studies researchers and a cutting-edge lab that is developing new methods for the analysis and data visualisation of online conspiracy culture. Using digital methods, we will first map out the scale and scope of contemporary conspiracy theory culture in both the mainstream and the 'deep' web. This will shed light on the forms of conspiracy theory that generate the most engagement; how they spread on particular platforms; the role of recommendation algorithms; and the identity, connectedness and political stance of the main creators of conspiracy content. The second strand of research will place the production and transmission of conspiracy theories on the Internet in historical perspective, comparing earlier moments of 'new media' transformation (such as radio), and tracing how conspiracy theories have changed as the Internet itself has evolved over the last half century. By examining the content moderation policies, this strand will also consider how various digital platforms encourage or hinder the exchange of conspiracy theories online. The third research strand will focus on the form and function of online conspiracism by focusing on its dominant images, metaphors and narratives. In particular we will consider whether the ease of creating links on websites tends to push conspiracy theories to more elaborate, hyper-connected forms. The fourth research strand will study how conspiracy theories are consumed and appropriated on the Internet. Where psychology has tried to identify the personality traits that attract people to conspiracy theories, our research will use an ethnographic approach to analyse online discussion fora and conduct interviews with conspiracy theorists to determine how their encounter with conspiracy theories helps forge individual and group identities, for better or worse. In the final strand we will also assess when online conspiracism turns harmful, and what, if anything, can be done about it. The main outcome of the project will be a definitive book that sets out the findings of the research. In collaboration with the Institute of Education and the charity Sense About Science, we will develop workshops and materials (a) to train school teachers how to deal with the problem of conspiracy theories in the classroom, including creating educational materials for use with young people and (b) to help scientists and science communicators address conspiracy theories about e.g. climate change and vaccinations. Working with the think tank Demos, we will hold a high-profile end-of-project event and produce a report for stakeholders.","In the era of fake news, disinformation and post-truth politics, the viral circulation of conspiracy theories on the Internet presents a pressing problem for civil society. Our research examines whether conspiracy theories are merely harmless entertainment, or whether they are particularly harmful to democracy and scientific knowledge. The 'Everything Is Connected' research project has been designed in consultation with a number of key stakeholders, who are keen to learn more about how and why conspiracy theories proliferate online, and what can and should be done about them. The potential impact of our research involves two areas: 1. Government policy making, and Internet platform provision and regulation Our research has been designed in consultation with representatives from various UK government departments and EU agencies who are concerned to understand the role that conspiracist misinformation plays in (a) undermining trust in civil institutions and expert knowledge and (b) the promotion of 'hateful extremism' (the term developed by the UK's Commission for Countering Extremism). We have also framed our research in consultation with some of the Internet platforms. In recent years there has been increasing public debate about the responsibilities of social media providers to police potentially misleading or harmful content on their platforms, and conspiracy theories are often one of the most prominent examples. Working with our project partner Demos (the London-based think tank), we will produce a report summarising the key research findings of the project, and organise two public events to engage with stakeholders from government and the digital media industry. 2. Critical digital literacy education and science communication Young people are believed to be particularly vulnerable to the attractions of fake news and misinformation (for example, a report by the UK Parliament's Commission on Fake News and the Teaching of Critical Literacy Skills in Schools found that only 2% of children in the UK have the skills they need to tell if a news story is real or fake). School teachers often find that they are confronted with conspiracy beliefs in the classroom, but are not equipped to deal with these situations. Likewise those involved in science communication (especially in the fields of climate change and vaccination) frequently find that their work is undermined by the popularity of conspiracy theories that claim the scientists are part of a deliberate hoax or cover-up. Working with our project partners the Institute of Education and the campaigning charity Sense about Science, we will develop workshops and toolkits for teachers and science communicators to help them understand more about how conspiracy theories work and how to tackle them.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV001213%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Connected Communities (CC) programme has been designed to be methodologically eclectic, reflecting both the range of approaches found in the various disciplines constituting the arts and humanities, as well as the cross-research council basis for the funded projects. Methodological eclecticism can be an obvious strength, offering the possibility of synthesising a range of approaches, generating diverse forms of data and answering complex questions which cut across traditional academic disciplines. However, there are risks with this approach, risks which are grounded in the uneven distribution of power and expertise within academic research projects. This research will explore these risks in two ways, in co-operation with a specific community: Early Career Researchers (ECRs). The project will run a series of events that will involve ECRs in the research process looking at differing methodological approaches within Connected Communities. It will also gather data on the ECR experience, via a mentoring scheme. Connecting Epistemologies will begin with an event that will showcase and develop ECR understanding of research methods for doing community research. It will then run a targeted mentoring and data collection programme over the course of four months. Finally it will run a workshop with the participants and the research team to prepare materials for a final event. The final event will be targeted across the range of academic disciplines involved in community research, which will present the findings from the data collection phase as well as papers offering further reflections on the methodological challenges facing community research. ECRs are a community defined and created by the funding council, giving the research a clearly bounded group to work with that has three important characteristics. 1) They are quasi-elite community (skilled but peripheral and precarious). Elite communities have not been made a substantive focus of the CC and this project would contribute to the gap in the CC work. 2) ECRs are a community with specific needs who would potentially benefit from the follow on funding to understand their role and position within the CC programme 3) ECRs working on CC projects are often at the front line of trying to navigate different disciplinary logics with community collaboration. The peripheral but elite nature of the ECR community creates an opportunity to explore and to challenge the assumptions underpinning the Connected Communities programme. The programme was designed to be collaborative. This project will raise questions about collaboration, as it focuses on an elite community who are embedded in methodological traditions that give greater or lesser status to collaboration. The project, when asking what the methodological circumstances necessary for collaboration might be, can also ask when collaboration begins and ends. In particular it will raise questions of power and control over data and lived experiences. How do lived experiences become data? How can these be presented? Who has control over them? These questions are explored by understanding the lived experiences of the ECR community, by the recruitment of 10 ECRs. They will be recruited by an event that seeks to raise awareness of the range of methodological possibilities associated with community research, but also to challenge the Connected Communities programme's assumptions that these may all be complimentary. The recruitment will be driven by the work of the community partner and members of the project team who have focused on participatory and collaborative research methods.","This project is focused on the quasi-elite community of ECRs within the Connected Communities programme. There will be impact for policy makers and managers within the AHRC and RCUK, particularly those involved in steering the Connected Communities programme. This aspect of impact will be conducted through the report and via the final event, which will invite the relevant staff and decision makers to attend. Most crucially the impacts of Connecting Epistemologies will be distinctly long term and will be felt by the community targeted by the project. Connecting Epistemologies seeks to reconfigure the understanding of community within Connected Communities, to allow that programme to recognise the existence of a community, in this case ECRs, who maybe part of the researchers that are assumed to be external or outwith the communities subject to research. Thus Connecting Epistemologies, as conceived in the case for support, is as much to do with the intellectual and personal development, via reflective practices, of the participants as it is to do with producing academic outputs. As a result of this focus it is estimated that the impact for both the project participants and the project team will be important in ways that will only become clear later on in their careers. The experience of being the researched, rather than the researcher, for the participants, alongside the experience of academic mentoring and project management for the project team. Furthermore the disseminated impacts of the project on the team and participants will diffuse in complex ways across the Connected Communities programme. This diffusion will be hard to estimate, but it is expected that those members of the project team involved in ongoing Connected Communities projects will bring their leadership, management and understanding of methods back into those projects. The participants will bring a further developed understanding of both the experience of being researched and of their own methods and methodological practices into their Connected Communities and future academic, or indeed non-academic, work. The understanding of impact presented here may seem focused on academic and policy beneficiaries. However this is the point of Connecting Epistemologies, which is a self conscious attempt to question the boundaries of community and academia that are implicit within the Connected Communities programme. This questioning extends, therefore, to the idea of impact.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013088%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              From early caricatures to recent accusations of anti-Asianism, comics in Latin America have a troubled relationship to race. As comics use visual shorthands to communicate complex cultural histories quickly, they are susceptible to simplistic, stereotypical representations of cultural difference. But comics artists in Latin America have also produced more considered explorations of race, sometimes constructing anti-racist discourses. Such work is vital in a region with a long history of racial mixture, produced out of indigenous populations, Iberian colonialists, black slaves and (especially Asian and European) economic migrants. Despite legislative advances addressing structural inequalities and growing awareness that racism is a widespread social problem, Latin America is still shaped by long-standing racial hierarchies, often obscured by celebrations of the region's mestizaje (race mixture). The relationship between comics and race demands attention both because of those racial tensions and also because Latin America is currently undergoing a comics renaissance. There are now more independent publishers dedicated to comics; festivals take place in both countries with established comics traditions (Mexico, Argentina and Brazil) and also in others (Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Peru); and, as well as growth in print and digital comics, artists are developing international links, not least as festivals abroad are seeking to work with the region's comics creators. This is the perfect moment to unpack how comics in the region have treated issues of blackness and indigeneity, and how the comics world, which remains predominantly white, might seek out ways to be less inscribed by racial inequalities. We cannot speak of Latin American comics 'industries' but rather of precarious, often self-funded grassroots activities. Like most creators in cultural industries, comics artists are underpaid (if at all) and sometimes even discriminated against (in Colombia, for example, drawing comics is not an 'official' profession, which affects employment status). Artists complain about the lack of shared knowledge of working practices and employment conditions. That is compounded by the diffuse nature of Latin American comics networks and the absence of any information about the relationship between race and the professional working environment. This project, therefore, responds to the need for: (a) better awareness of the history of race in Latin American comics by looking at works from the nineteenth century to the present in three different countries - Argentina, Colombia and Peru - that have different racial backgrounds and comics histories; and (b) better knowledge of how race inflects the work of contemporary artists and of the nature of working practices for such artists. To achieve (a), the project will undertake archival research in Latin America, Europe and the US and will focus on four key periods in the history of Latin American comics: Early interventions (1890s-1930s); The Golden Age (1940s-1970s); Crisis and Early Activism (1970s-1990s); Recent Renaissances (2000s-2010s). To achieve (b), we will work with six contemporary Latin American comics artists. During two retreats, we will hold interviews and discussions with these artists, before opening up those conversations for networking events with other local artists, publishing houses, archivists and festival organisers. These meetings will foment shared knowledge about comics production, especially in relation to race. Artists and researchers will collaborate on two fanzines and a curated online exhibition. The former will be circulated around libraries and archives in Latin America and the English-speaking world, to encourage racism awareness. The latter will be promoted via comics platforms, including the Colombian project partner Entreviñetas, and will incorporate space for viewers to submit their own comics as responses to issues raised by artists and researchers.","This project will look at the relationship between one of Latin America's most cutting-edge popular cultural forms, comics, and one of its most pressing social issues: racial inequalities. We will produce in-depth, transhistorical and transregional analysis of race in the region's comics, and explore the relationship between race and comics both on the page and in the wider professional field. Who Will Benefit? Comics Artists: the project will work with six artists and invite others to participate in discussion workshops at the end of two retreat periods. Though the comics world in Latin America is predominantly white, we will create a racially diverse group of artists, some of whom self-identify as black/indigenous. Comics Professionals: we will invite comics producers, publishers and festival organisers to participate in wider discussions about race, social inequalities and comics production in Latin America. Entreviñetas Comics Platform (Project Partner): we will link one retreat period and one workshop to Entreviñetas, one of Latin America's most influential comics platforms (it annually invites around 30 artists from around 9 different countries to its festivals). Comics Consumers: we will reach out to readers on the topic of race via the fanzines produced collaboratively by artists and researchers, and via the curated online exhibition, both available in Spanish and English. How Will They Benefit? Though frequently present race rarely takes centre stage in Latin American comics. Even though the predominantly white world of comics production in Latin America is increasingly aware of gender inequalities and - to a lesser degree - inequalities around sexual identities, race remains underexplored. The 2018 itinerant exhibit 'Taco de ojo' (hosted in Argentina, Peru and Mexico), a collection of works by 50 comics artists depicting originary peoples, indicates growing interest in and desire for explicit, in-depth research into race and comics.  Artists, producers, festival organisers and members of the general public will all benefit from having better access to analysis of historical and regional trends related to this particular issue. By making blackness and indigeneity explicit topics for discussion, and exploring the particularities of the form when depicting race, comics professionals will be better placed to reflect on how racism informs their working contexts. Likewise, consumers will be better informed about how comics can address racial inequalities. We hope that the latter group in particular will be inspired to explore how comics also address other forms of social inequalities. The project will also help raise the international profile of the project's artists, not least as we will publicise their work in translation both in the two fanzines and via the curated online exhibition. Latin American comics artists are under-paid (if at all) and lack the resources to participate in networking activities. The retreats and workshops will give them a platform to develop professional networks with peers and producers alike. Moreover, by creating a briefing document out of the resulting conversations, we will respond directly to comments made in 2018 to the PI by artists in Bogotá, who lamented the absence of cross-regional networks and the lack of shared information about production costs, contracts, funding opportunities, technology, international links, etc. That document will provide essential information of lasting benefit to up-and-coming artists in Latin America and beyond and help them to confront professional constraints. We want to stress that, in all these elements, the researchers will learn a great deal from artists, producers and consumers. The collaborative nature of the retreat discussions, the wider workshops, the two fanzines and the online exhibition will inform the development of the project's line of research and self-reflection about alternative modes of academic expression.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT004606%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              In 2004, the PI undertook an AHRC funded project entitled ""Screenprinted colour as a theoretical model for the development of inkjet technology"" (award number B/SG/AN5190/APN19134).  This bid seeks to build upon and extend the methods developed and explored in the previous research. Funding is requested to support a collaboration between CFPR and Pulse Roll Label Products Ltd., a specialist manufacturer of inks and varnishes for the label printing and the packaging industries. The collaboration will use the results of the 2004 research by exploiting recent developments in inkjet technology to enable Pulse to develop innovative UV cure ink products for commercial print applications, thus giving them an advantage in the field.  Today, the field of colour printing is becoming increasingly more technical and remote from traditional methods of the application of colour in the physical world. The way an artist mixes and applies colour is fundamentally different to the digital reproduction of colour and coloured images. An artist's approach to colour printing is concerned with the physical mixing of pigments that are then applied as layers of colour, whereas the digital reproduction of colour is reliant on computational colour modelling to provide accurate numerical data for reproduction. Artists using digital colour are now becoming cognisant in an increasingly technical environment that demands more understanding of different colour spaces, characterisation of printer hardware and paper and an array of file formats. The research developed by Parraman (2004) demonstrated that a more practical knowledge and perceptual understanding of colour can be formulated from the perspective of traditional methods by physically mixing colour pigments and overlayering colour.  In 2004, the technological capabilities and colour science were not ready for exploitation, in part because of limitations in the capability of inkjet print heads. Inkjet printing technology and knowledge has matured, and recent improvements in print head technology and software have increased the potential to inkjet print a wider range of inks onto a wider variety of materials. The previous research will now allow the use of a range of colorants that expand the current process colour set (bespoke colour palettes that match artists colours) spot colours (Pantone) pigments and decorative inks (metallic, mica, gloss) and novel colorants (fluorescent and colour changing) onto materials including leather, wallpaper, metallic card, plastic. As demonstrated at industrial print expos, the shift from the traditional screenprint and lithography market to high-speed inkjet printing is partially due to developments in UV curable inks, which have better adhesion to a range of materials, resulting in a diversity of novel print applications, including: decorative printing for packaging, textiles and labelling. This development in UV curing creates greater potential for layering in relation to the findings of the 2004 research. Additionally it creates further potential for commercial exploitation for printer and ink manufacturers to develop UV curing inks.  Pulse, who produce UV curable, water-based inks and varnishes for flexography (flexo), screen and letterpress printing, wish to address colour printing from the perspective of traditional overlayering of colour to create secondary colour effects. This proposal will move beyond halftoning and process colours - CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black) towards the development of custom pigments and decorative inks to obtain new colour mixtures. This proposal seeks to undertake collaboration with an industrial partner in order to exploit developments in UV curable inks and industrial print heads printing higher viscosity inks combined with the previous research methodology. The results should lead to new methods for printing from a practitioner perspective aligned more closely to the creative arts and creative industries.","New methodological and practical approaches to printing in relation to labelling and packaging, design and digital print.  The impact will be measured through the ability to make commercial artwork that is conceived using the same methodological approach as currently used by artists as applied in an industrial context. This will lead to skills development, training and new knowledge for the collaborators involved including Pulse employees, CFPR staff and workshop attendees in new methodological approaches to printed colour. Through the National Gallery seminar, current interest in the methods of testing the multi layering of inks, development of custom colour palettes using traditional artists based pigments would have new implications and impact for colour reproduction of old master paintings, and could provide the heritage sector with new ways of producing facsimiles of original works.  The different methods for measuring the printed inks are highly important for different academic and industrial communities. To gain quantitative data, colour, density and gonio (multi-dimensional) measurements are necessary for parity and metrics, and commercial exploitation. To provide useful information for the creative community high quality microphotography, printed samples and application ideas are necessary to perceive textural appreciation of ink on paper.  Results will be published via the CFPR website, and through journals including The Journal of Imaging Science and Technology, Journal of the International Association of Colour, and through the Society of Dyers and Colourists. The journals will be aimed at the colour science community, wideformat printing industry and academics.  Printed samples will be demonstrated at LabelExpo to commercial and industrial printers.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL015277%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              With the launch of the Coalition's plans to mark the centenary of the Great War, the Communities Secretary observed: 'As the First World War moves out of common memory into history, we're determined to make sure these memories are retained', but which common memories did he have in mind? Remembering, just like forgetting, is always a political act. The war was a global conflict which left its mark on the local. Was it experienced differently in urban and rural areas? What were the relationships between soldiers and civilians during and after the war? Did it shape individual and community identities? Did it have different meanings for contemporaries? There was a consensus that the dead were to be commemorated and remembered, but there was less agreement over how the example of sacrifice was to be understood and the meanings to be attributed to and experiences to be drawn from acts of commemoration. How have these meanings changed over time? How will it be understood today? Is it a truism that 'the past is a foreign country: they do things differently there'? Certainly, Britain today is a very different country to that of 1914 and has been described by Parekh (2000) as 'a community of communities.' What sense will young people make of the local memorials to the dead which sit in the urban and rural landscapes and the acts of commemoration organised by an older generation which will centre upon them? What meaning will the war have for young people who have grown up in a society where live reports of conflict are readily available on a smartphone and where the return of the dead from Afghanistan is instantly reported in the media? How will they connect the past with their present and their future? As the First World War moves out of memory into history, what will be the record of commemoration they will have experienced that will be left after 2018 for future historians to reflect upon? These are just some of the questions which have been generated by reflecting on the joint Arts and Humanities Research Council/Heritage Lottery Fund commemorative project. These reflections have in turn shaped the 'Voices of War and Peace: the Great War and its Legacy' project proposal.  At the core of this cross disciplinary project is an institutional commitment to community engagement with research and a professional commitment 'in a mission of understanding' to investigate, analyse, apprehend, criticize and judge and thereby translate Edward Said's idea of 'communities of interpretation' into practice (Said 2003). Using Birmingham, the UK's second city, as its primary place of memory, the project will reach out to multiple communities/publics both local and national to explore through dialogue issues around memory, remembering and commemoration. The research network will respond to community requests for support in terms of capacity building and support community driven research agenda. Working with other funded centres and the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE) the project will invest in developing the community engagement experience of early career researchers. A strength of the network beyond its relevant knowledge expertise is the experience embedded within its membership of effective partnership working. As an internationally engaged network, it will seek out relations with cultural institutions in Birmingham's sister cities and through the Universitas 21 network to understand other national and local processes of commemoration and thereby further illuminate our understanding of memorial activities in the UK. Sharing knowledge, expertise and resources, it is intended that the project will leave its own legacy for community/academy relations in terms of the capacity for the co-design and co-production of research, an understanding of the complicated relationship between remembering and forgetting and a desire to continue to 'think forward through the past'.","Many groups can be identified that will benefit from the Voices of War and Peace project. The most direct beneficiaries will be the partner organisations who have agreed to collaborate and whose letters of support are included with this application. These organisations will benefit from their staff being involved in working across the academy/cultural sector divide and gaining insights into the research culture to be found in the university sector. None of the partners currently have the capacity to be identified as independent research organisations but involvement in the project will support the development of a research culture especially through the engagement of those participants in the University Cultural Partnership Honorary Research Fellow and Associate scheme. In particular this will impact on the Library of Birmingham and Birmingham Museums Trust and their ambition to move towards possible Independent Research Organisation status.  Partner organisations will also have gained increased understanding of the needs, interests and knowledge of communities be they local, regional or virtual and also insights into the community research agendas of the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement [NCCPE] and the AHRC.  A second, but as yet difficult to quantify, group of benificiaries will be the various communities who will have engaged in dialogue with the researchers in the network and in collaborative research. At the heart of the AHRC/HLF/NCCPE initiative around the commemoration of the First World War is a capacity building agenda. Active engagement in researching community heritage projects will have been supported by the research network through the provision of workshops which will mean that individuals can gain skills relevant to ensuring that heritage is better looked after, managed, understood and shared including, among others, conservation, digital and project management skills. Relationships are at the core of the quality of life in geographically defined communities and active engagement in participatory and inclusive community heritage projects can strengthen the resilience of communities and the sense of belonging. The dialogue between communities and researchers around the commemoration of the First World War will have focused on sensitive issues around what is remembered and what is forgotten and will have drawn attention to different interpretations of the past. The ideas of 'community' and 'collective memory' are embedded in these interpretations and reflecting on how the past is made accessible in the present will have the potential to enable individuals and communities to understand how they are positioned in relation to the past. A third group of beneficiaries will be those members of the research network, including Early Career Researchers, who have little or no experience of working with communities on heritage related projects as the Centre will organise training and workshops on undertaking public engagement.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL008149%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The sports media is a compelling site of cultural negotiation which brings into sharp relief specific forms of gender as they are articulated through intersections with other distinct social categories, in particular: race, sexuality and dis/ability. Academic work showing cultural prejudice against women and minority groups articulated within the sports media is well established. This is predicated on the particular significance afforded to such social hierarchies in the sporting arena, which is one of the most high-profile areas of modern society in which segregation on the basis of gender and/or dis/ability is deemed acceptable. The issues of racism, homophobia and trans rights are also areas of contestation which cannot be overlooked. Although the 'colour line' barring black athletes from competing with and against white athletes no longer exists, colourism remains within sports media representations of athletes. While athletes are not excluded from competition on the basis of their sexuality, it remains the case that, for example, there is no openly homosexual professional male footballer in England. Debates about the participation of trans women athletes in women's sports continue to be hotly contested. These factors are a reflection of, and further contextualised by, contemporary debates about minority rights and identity politics of which social movements and associated campaigns, for example #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter, are a visible part. Thus, as Cairns argues, it is vital that sports journalists are equipped to handle such complex and challenging issues. At the same time there is a pressing need to ensure that research is both informed by, but also relevant to, professional practice. It is vital for scholars concerned with the narratives constructed around social identities by and within sports media to actively translate their research for non-academic audiences. Sport media scholars can only adequately drive future research into intersectional representation in sports media, shape its values, and give it the direction it needs to remain relevant by building strong networks with appropriate media, sport and leisure policy makers and practitioners. By working with members of organizations such as the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ) and the Sports Journalists' Association (SJA), the network will facilitate not only research-informed pedagogy in the field of sports media studies and related academic areas but also produce recommendations for sports journalism courses both within and outside the academy. The network's main activity will be a series of working papers produced focused on the intersection of gender with race, disability and LGBTQ+ issues. The working documents will identify the three to four most pressing issues effecting sports media in the relevant area as agreed through workshop discussions involving the attending academic and non-academic participants. In turn, these working papers will facilitate the production of a final report that will provide recommendations and guidance for current professional practice in the area. The report will also provide recommendations to facilitate research-informed teaching, therefore impacting upon pedagogical practice and giving those entering the profession in forthcoming years the insight and skills to navigate the issues addressed in the report. Thus, the network seeks to shape the content of future sports media outputs by changing both the content of current sports media practice and the pedagogical practice of current sports journalism trainers (and thus future sports media practice).",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW003988%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project aims to increase knowledge and understanding of the contemporary feature-length documentary film industry in the UK. It has three core objectives: 1) to map the industry and analyse its operation; 2) to historicise the industry's formation and the factors that have shaped its development; and 3) to investigate the criticisms and challenges the industry faces and explore how these might be addressed.  Documentary has formed a major part of British film culture ever since John Grierson, the figurehead of the British Documentary Movement (1926-46), coined the term in 1926. However, with so much British scholarship focusing on that period and its achievements, subsequent developments have been marginalised. One of those developments has been the emergence of a feature documentary industry comprised of organisations dedicated to the production of feature-length (70 minutes or more) films for broadcast or theatrical exhibition that is distinct from - albeit often related to - factual or specialist factual television production). Since the beginning of the 21st century, feature-length documentaries have experienced a major upsurge in popularity and become a significant global box-office attraction. Although this is most obviously evidenced by US films such as Farenheit 9/11 (2004) or An Inconvenient Truth (2006), a range of UK feature documentaries have enjoyed significant (critical if not necessarily commercial) success, including Black Gold (2005), The End of the Line (2008), Selfmade (2010), Up in Smoke (2011), the Oscar-nominated The Act of Killing (2012), and the Oscar-winning Citizen Four (2014). As a result, the UK feature documentary industry is now an established part of the broader film and television industries, with distinct subsectors dedicated to finance, production, distribution and exhibition. Yet despite its established presence, and the fact that UK documentary is widely acknowledged to be experiencing a 'golden age' (Sight & Sound, September 2014, p. 52), little scholarly attention has been paid to the industrial structures underpinning it. There is thus a timely and urgent need to study the UK documentary industry if its current economic and cultural success is to be understood, supported and sustained.  This project has been developed in association with three institutional partners - the British Film Institute (BFI), Creative England and The Grierson - as well as five partners from each of the industry's main subsectors (finance, production, distribution and exhibition): The BRITDOC Foundation is the leading broker of documentary film finance and distribution in the UK; Dartmouth Films is one of the UK's most influential documentary production companies; Dogwoof is the UK's leading documentary distributor; Sheffield Doc/Fest is the preeminent documentary film festival in the UK; and Yaddo, the UK's first documentary webcaster, was launched in 2016 by the former head of BBC Storyville, the UK's leading broadcast platform. All partners will participate in the research via a series of semi-structured interviews, while the partners from the industry's subsectors will also take part in a period of Participant Observation. Combined with desk-based analyses of primary and secondary materials (academic literature, trade press, close analysis of the films themselves), this comprehensive methodology will best enable the three core objectives to be addressed. The project will have a number of tangible applications and benefits to the industry in addition to the range of academic outputs it will generate. The policy proposals will provide the BFI and Creative England with evidence-based, practically-applicable recommendations. Together with the Doc/Fest workshops and project website, these will facilitate knowledge exchange between academia and industry that will expand understanding and work towards a more sustainable, innovative and culturally and economically successful documentary industry.","There are three principal pathways to impact in this project:  1) Policy proposals to transform the research findings into evidence-based, practically-applicable recommendations with tangible benefits for the industry. These will be discussed with scholars and industry stakeholders throughout the project, and drafted into a formal document that will be presented to representatives from the BFI, Creative England and The Grierson Trust at a seminar conducted by the PI and Co-I in year 3. The document will then be made available for print-on-demand from the project website. 2) Workshops on the research at Doc/Fest in years 1 and 2. These will consist of speakers from industry and academia in discussion with the audience and will raise awareness of the project among the international documentary community, explore the core research objectives and discuss potential policy interventions. 3) A project website (and associated social media accounts), which will host information about the project and its partners (each of which will link to the project website from their respective web pages). The website will include a blog with guest contributions from various industry stakeholders and project participants and will provide a means of regular engagement with both industry and academia. To ensure any unanticipated impacts can be documented, users will be asked to register (but will also be able to continue anonymously) to enable subsequent contact by the research team.  In addition, major beneficiaries of the project include the five industry subsector partners and the three institutional partners. The subsector partners will benefit from the project's research into their organisations, the operation of the industry today and the historical conditions that have shaped its development. All partners will benefit from the project's analysis of the challenges and criticisms the industry faces, with institutional partners especially benefiting from the focus on what policy interventions they could make to overcome those challenges. All partners' involvement in the project will help produce novel interactions between stakeholders and academics, which will nurture new research questions, policy interventions and cultural and commercial opportunities. These interactions will take place throughout the project but especially during the two Doc/Fest workshops, the symposium and the conference. In addition to these specific pathways, the research will have a number of other impacts on the documentary industry. It will help create new and consolidate existing networks across and within the industry subsectors (finance, production, distribution, exhibition), and will help facilitate more critical, reflexive and long-term thinking between the project partners. This in turn will enable the development and exchange of practical, theoretically and historically-informed knowledge that will result in a documentary industry that is better understood, and which will therefore be able to address its weaknesses and play to its strengths, and identify future avenues for enquiry. To ensure the impact of these multiple elements are thoroughly explored, an Impact Evaluation Officer (IEO) will work with the investigators in the final year. She/he will carry out follow-up work with the project partners, Doc/Fest workshop attendees and other stakeholders. The IEO will write-up her/his findings and submit these to the investigators prior to the end of the project. This will enable all evidence of the project's impact to be thoroughly collated and the full impact of the project to be properly accounted for.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP013805%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The rapid expansion in Chinese involvement in Africa in the 21st century has been accompanied by conflicting discourses about what that interest means, both for Africa and for the West. While Chinese and African leaders have consistently promoted the idea of a partnership based on mutual benefit, many journalists and the majority of Western leaders have sounded cautionary notes of alarm, some even going so far as to label China a 'rogue donor'. Academic research has sought to interrogate some of the myths that have sprung up around Sino-African co-operation, and has taken the form primarily of case studies of Chinese trade, development and aid in selected African countries, with some more recent studies also focussing on the expansion of China's 'soft power'. Within all these discussions, one essential aspect of Sino-African interaction has gone largely unstudied: issues of translation, both in the narrower sense of how Chinese and African people communicate and in the broader, metaphorical sense of how African culture is 'translated' for the Chinese, and vice versa, have received little or no critical attention. Yet such translations form a critical part of all co-operation, and 'translations' of culture in the broader sense are becoming increasingly prominent in the agendas of the political leaders: cultural exchanges and 'cultures-in-focus' events now feature strongly in official programmes of Sino-African co-operation. This project aims to address this gap, seeking to identify the dominant images of Africa that are being 'translated' for the Chinese and vice versa, and to explore questions of agency in the translation process (who decides what is to be translated, for whom, and for what reasons).  In light of the incredible size, complexity and diversity of both China and Africa, this project can only provide indicative, rather than comprehensive, responses to these questions, and in this respect it may be viewed as a pilot study which will unearth as many new questions as it will provide answers. The project will consist of two interrelated parts. Firstly, it will involve a global survey of literary translation, identifying all African literature translated for China since 2000 AD, and all Chinese literature made available to African audiences over the same period. It will explore the types of themes that dominate, and identify any that are consistently excluded, and will examine the ways in which the reading matter is framed for its new audiences through covers, prefaces, and blurbs. Secondly, the project will study the translation of other types of cultural and media products, such as films, TV programmes, performances, exhibitions and newspapers across several geographically and temporally limited spaces in both China and Africa, once again paying attention to the types of cultural products and themes that are favoured and exploring the ways in which they are 'translated', both literary and metaphorically, for the new audiences. Through this combined approach the project thus aims to identify both the principal translation patterns that hold between China and Africa today and the predominant images that each side is forming of the other. Grounded on the premise, developed and repeatedly confirmed through translation studies research, that translation carries an indicative function, or in other words, that it can reveal as much about cultures and intercultural dynamics as it is itself shaped by them, the study thus aims to enhance academic and popular understanding of the Sino-African relationship. The research will be disseminated through a variety of channels including conference papers, journal articles, policy papers, an international conference and a co-edited volume; its intended audiences include political think-tanks, learned societies and non-profit organisations, publishers, booksellers and the general public, as well as academic audiences across a wide range of disciplines.","China's rapidly growing interaction with Africa creates a potentially very wide range of beneficiaries from this research. The China-Africa relationship seems likely to be of long-term significance both for the direct participants and in a global social, economic and geo-political context. The impact of this research is therefore likely to be both substantial and sustained, and will be felt across a range of professions as well as appealing to public interest. Some impression of the scope of the project's impact is given below; please note, however, that the research and networking activities that form part of the project are also expected to give rise to additional impacts, and these will be explored as they arise. 1) Policy institutes, learned societies and other non-profit organisations Our research will be of particular relevance to think-tanks and non-profit organisations in the UK and abroad, notably the China Policy Institute (University of Nottingham), the Africa Asia Centre of the Royal African Society, the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the European Centre for Research in Asia, Africa and Latin America (ECRAAL) and UNESCO. By foregrounding a relatively under-researched topic that nevertheless underlies many more traditional areas of enquiry, such as development, trade, aid and education, we anticipate that our research will bring an important fresh perspective to the learning and expertise represented by these societies and organizations. Through the impact pathways already in place through these societies, we will also be able to make our research available to governments and companies looking for expert input into their strategies and foreign and cultural policies. Insights into the way the China-Africa dialogues are framed and translated could have an important bearing, for example, on the way in which policy-makers - whether in Africa or in its traditional western counterparts such as France and the UK - view the growing presence of Chinese people, cultural exchanges and investments in Africa and how they interact with or take account of these for the future. It should enrich the evidence-base for the critical evaluation of these interactions. Better linguistic understanding, prompted by a more transparent translation environment, could thus potentially assist cultural dialogue, facilitate better commercial and economic decision-making and help in public discourse and policy-making on a very broad front. We recognize that the limited scope of this research proposal is but a very small step on this path; nevertheless, it illustrates how many more opportunities the project may open up. 2) Publishers and Booksellers The findings of the literary translation survey will be of particular interest to publishers, publishers' networks and booksellers in China and Africa, particularly those for whom the publication of Africa-related material, or of translated literature more generally, represents an important part of their business. In China, this includes the Hunan Literature and Art Publishing House and the Hunan Educational Press; in Africa, the African Publishers' Network and the Pan African Booksellers' Association are key organisations. Our research is expected to have an impact on the strategic planning in which these organisations, or those represented through the networks, are involved by providing a global overview of existing publishing priorities and highlighting notable gaps in publishing markets.  3) General Public The intrinsic public appeal of studies of China's involvement in Africa is evidenced by the regularity and prominence of media reports on the topic, and by the rapid growth in books and documentaries targeting non-academic audiences. Our research will help enable a shift away from what Deborah Brautigam (2009) has termed the 'myths' surrounding China's engagement in Africa, offering an accessible and fascinating perspective on the realities of Chinese-African co-operation",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL007150%2F1

It investigates youth languages practices amongst speakers of Kiswahili in East and Central Africa (Tanzania, Kenya and DRC), Lingala in Central Africa (DRC) and isiZulu-Ndebele in Southern Africa (these are names which refer to a continuum of sorts spoken in areas between Zimbabwe and South Africa).  Previous studies have tended to focus on specific aspects of youth languages, particularly in the African context. This includes work looking at the creative manipulation and word play with which youth languages are commonly associated, as well as the rapidly changing vocabularies. A parallel development in recent years has seen an increasing body of work examining aspects of structural microvariation in the Bantu languages - a group of some 450-600 languages spoken across much of central, eastern and Southern Africa. The language family exhibits a range of broad similarities but also a high degree of fine-grained more subtle differences.  The proposed project seeks to bring these two erstwhile distinct strands of work together and provide an improved understanding of youth languages practices on the one hand (moving away from the focus on manipulation and ethnographic approaches), and a better understanding of structural variation across the Bantu languages on the other. It is also anticipated that this innovative approach will contribution to an improved understanding of the structural variation found in African youth languages. The project brings together an international team of experts and is structured around four streams of work. The team in the UK will lead the workstream focusing on Kiswahili and the team in Germany will lead the workstream focusing on Lingala. The two teams will work jointly on isiZulu-Ndebele, as well as collaborating on a final comparative stream. Crucial to the project is the involvement of international experts and close collaboration with partners based on the African continent.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW010798%2F1

It will explore the role of publicly visible memory and its potential impact on issues such as reconciliation and healing in the wake of conflict, and how could and should (consciously and unconsciously) memory processes shape the present and future. These questions of memory (and forgetting) are intensely political and have far-reaching consequences and these debates are vital to institutions of cultural memory that engage with the past in order to make sense of the present and build towards a more peaceful future. The network will therefore explore how public institutions (such as museums and other heritage sites that support education/awareness) can deal with the past? What is the role if any of such institutions in transitional justice and making sense of contested pasts as a part of peacebuilding and conflict prevention? The network will seek to facilitate connections with academics and other relevant stakeholders and mobilise arts and social institutions engaged in peace, conflict and cultural discourse in the UK and abroad in selected regions. It is an innovative network that brings together academics who work on post-conflict societies and organisations and museum practitioners in countries that have recently experienced armed conflicts or genocide. It will posit a central research question: what is the role of museums and memory sites that deal with memory and conflict, and how can they more effectively promote tolerance, resilience, inter-group and inter-ethnic cooperation? Within that question, the network will deal with a number of sub-questions, such as: What is a museum's responsibility in the formation and maintenance of cultural memory? Which strategies for public engagement work and which do not? Within these broad themes, the network will focus on several research questions in detail by exploring case studies from relevant practitioners and institutions. Firstly, it will investigate the role of art and artists in a museum/site of memory context in contributing to peacebuilding processes. Secondly, the network will facilitate discussions around the question of how youth can be engaged actively in peacebuilding through engagement with museums/sites of memory. The network will especially foreground the contribution from academics and institutions from post conflict societies in particular from the Former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and the Great Lakes region, Lebanon and the Middle East and Colombia and Latin America. It will facilitate a series of virtual and physical workshops and seminars and two major conferences on Museums and Memory to be held in Sarajevo in 2022 and 2023. It will support the development of several live projects between museums and other civic society actors including the Srebrenica Genocide Memorial, The Post Conflict Research Centre in Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovina, and the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW009854%2F1

Experimental approaches to derivation have often been hampered by overly simplistic assumptions about the structural domain of word formation (or more precisely lexeme formation, as distinct from wordform formation as in inflectional morphology). The central debate has been about whether words (lexemes) are or are not decomposed in the mental lexicon, and it has remained somewhat unclear how morphological relatedness is founded on form overlap and/or semantic compositionality, and what the role of frequencies of occurrence is in processing derived words. The planned research compares English and German, which are related languages with comparable but not identical linguistic structures. For example, suffixation and prefixation prevail and allow morpho-phonological alternations in both languages. Nevertheless, there are systematic phonological differences (e.g., stress alternations in English, umlaut alternations in German), and the morphological categories involved in derivation are not identical, either (e.g., gender is only relevant in German). There has been both behavioural as well as brain-imaging data from our own labs that suggests that the depth of morphological derivation does affect processing, but as yet we have not investigated the time-course of this effect, nor have we systematically manipulated phonological alternations in derivation. This will be investigated in a series of electrophysiological studies in German and English. We will be able to compare different types of morphological complexities, with and without phonological alternations, and our results will also allow us to make cross-linguistic generalisations in a way which is not possible when examining a single language, as is still the rule in experimental morphology.",N/A,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT012862%2F1

Only 57% of countries have an adequate definition of inclusive education and a quarter of teachers globally feel unprepared for teaching inclusively. At the report's launch UNESCO called for more creatively and sensitively derived data to support the reconceptualisation of education systems to ensure inclusion for all children. We are a collective of researchers from the UK, Nigeria and South Africa. Our proposed study focuses on the under-researched commonalities and differences of how inclusion and exclusion are experienced across education systems. There are three strands: a digital storytelling approach to generate new discourses around inclusion and exclusion in these contexts; a critical, ethnographic evaluation of the storytelling research process to show how storytelling could be better and more ethically used in research and; a storytelling research knowledge exchange Hub. The storytelling element will explore young people's, teachers', teacher educators' and policymakers' perspectives on what it means to be included in or excluded in education. It will adapt an established approach for generating stories through creative workshops to produce 60-72 digital stories which document experiences and perspectives on inclusion/exclusion (at least 20 from each country). The approach incorporates closed and public story screening, analysis and dissemination events hosted with the support of project collaborators (stakeholders in education provision at local and national levels). These events will be designed to support rich and nuanced dialogues around how to reconceptualise education settings and processes to support wider inclusion. A comparative ethnography of the storytelling element will be carried out in parallel by ethnographers from the UK, South Africa and Nigeria. This is important because storytelling research is often presented as a panacea for international development challenges but there are risks involved that relate to who is facilitating the process and how: this can reproduce imbalances of power and knowledge around social issues in African and UK contexts. The ethnographic strand will critically document and analyse through an anti-colonial lens how knowledge about inclusion/exclusion is perceived to surface through the storytelling processes in each context and how power relations are perceived to play out within these processes. This strand will lead to critically conceptualised guides for researchers and practitioners wanting to learn or improve storytelling research techniques (with a particular focus on anti-colonial practices) and for policymakers wanting to use storytelling data to develop programmes and policies. The Hub will be an online, open access site of storytelling research resources, knowledge exchange and innovation. We will invite diverse contributions from researchers, practitioners and activists globally to foster critical dialogue around storytelling research, diversify the knowledge base and enhance access to storytelling resources and debates, especially for academics and practitioners across Africa who do not have institutional access to journals or funds for storytelling research guides and materials. Together, these strands will contribute to addressing issues around young people's inclusion in different contexts, as well as document and analyse how researchers can learn to work with complex, arts-based storytelling approaches in a critical and anti-colonial way. It is directly aligned with the AHRC's aim to bring a deep cultural understanding into the realm of international development: it positions storytelling as both an epistemology and research approach, and as a mode of knowledge generation as well as a form of expression and engagement.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV009117%2F1

Several black intellectuals have gained increasing prominence in the public arena and have consequently developed a platform for talking, writing, and thinking about black activism and what it means to be a black intellectual in the 21st century. Yet, the concept of the black intellectual - when it has been recognised at all - has historically been gendered as male. Black male intellectuals have often talked for and about black women, subsequently marginalising the significance of the black female intellectual both historically and in the contemporary arena.  This network therefore brings together scholars, both early career (including PhD students) and more established academics, working on black female intellectuals in the black Atlantic including Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The key point of the network is to share interdisciplinary understandings of black female intellectuals from both historical and contemporary perspectives thinking through different questions which will be used to frame the workshops. The first workshop will ask, as the central research question and the introductory session, how do we define ""black intellectuals"" as a concept? Does gender impact on this definition? What is it that the black female intellectual brings to the public debate and what forms are considered credible?  The second workshop will consider how geographic and temporal parameters alter the form that understandings of the black female intellectuals take and the ways these differences are articulated. Biracial journalist and author Afua Hirsch has been invited to contribute to this workshop.  A third workshop will question how issues of gender and class impact on understandings of black female intellectuals both as a form of activism (doing) and thinking (intellectualism). In particular, it will interrogate the differences between black male and black female intellectuals and explore the ways in which intersectionality functions more broadly within black intellectualism. Black activist and educator, Chardine taylor-Stone will contribute to this workshop. Leading on from this, a fourth workshop will consider the role of social media in shaping the experience of black female intellectuals in the contemporary world owing to the varied and multiple media resources available. Female activists from the Black Lives Matter movement based in the UK and Europe will be invited to share their experiences in addition to contributions from Gal-Dem, an online and print magazine written by women of colour.  The workshops will also have a series of public lectures running alongside them located in public venues and pertaining to the individual theme of each workshop with invited speakers from across the interdisciplinary spectrum of the network. The network will apply for follow-on funding to host an international conference on black female intellectuals hosted by the University of East Anglia, bringing together practitioners, academics, and public policy groups namely the Runnymede Trust & the partnership project, History and Policy. The application for follow-on funding will also include a separate seminar event hosted by History and Policy using the project's Runnymede report as its focus and inviting interested policy makers including the Institute of Race Relations and the Black Training and Enterprise group, practitioners such as Chardine Taylor-Stone, journalists from both national and local media including Liv Little (Gal-Dem), Afua Hirsch (Guardian), and members of the network.","During the UN International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024) it is significant that Black women remain the most socially-disadvantaged and socially excluded groups across the Atlantic world. The project therefore will further explore their collective responses to this via the network. It will be the first step in a longer collaboration between the University of East Anglia and the London School of Economics and Political Science and with other non-academic groups across the diaspora including international activist movements, policy groups, the heritage sector, educators, and the general public. The series of public lectures given by a number of scholars from across the disciplines in different locations across the UK will be a space for knowledge exchange to interested members of the black diaspora. The network will also connect with national groups, including the Windrush Foundation and the UK's Anti-Apartheid movement. It will also work at a more local level with Norfolk's Black History Month committee, which the P-I has already collaborated with in the past and the Oxford-based African and African Caribbean Kultural Heritage Initiative (Ackhi). The public lectures will also be of significance to the general populace interested in the histories of the impact of the black presence, culturally and intellectually, on the UK, US, Caribbean, and Europe. The project also acts as a platform for recognised activist movements such as Black Lives Matter and the British Black Power Movement. The project will provide them with increased visibility and enhanced public understanding of black activism, black female intellectuals, and intersectionality. It also offers the possibility of extending connections and future collaboration between these groups and the academic community through research and teaching course design. Through a working report co-authored by the PI and Co-I, and in collaboration with the Runnymede Trust, UK policy groups concerned with race equality will benefit from the insight of the network and ideas for future projects. Guided by the network's discussions over the course of the project and the input of the partnership project, History and Policy, the report will concern how the work of black female intellectuals in the UK can be used to further policy agendas.  The website will be an essential space for communicating events with those involved with the network and the general public. Members of the network will be consulted at the beginning of the project about the design of the website as it is being developed to ensure that it suits the network's remit and will host details of the aims of the network, the key participants, call for papers, information on public lectures and workshops, a blog, as well as a mailing list.  The museum and heritage industries, specifically those catering to black history in the UK, will be able to engage a wider audience through using material from the project's outputs, particularly the website, applying the interpretative analysis for use in future exhibits and presentations. The creative arts industry might use the focus of the project and its findings to deliver a number of diverse productions (drama, interpretative dance, film making) on certain individuals or ideas. Educators in the UK - at primary, secondary, and sixth form levels - who are interested in expanding the curriculum beyond slavery and civil rights leaders of the 1960s, would be able to engage with material on the website, with accessible materials (including images, presentations and lesson plans) in addition to a wide bibliography of resources pertaining to black intellectualism. The PI and Co-I will consult with teachers and schools via our respective Widening Participating teams in order that the material connects with key learning objectives as established in the National Curriculum's framework.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS006397%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Digital Creativity for Regional Museums project follows on from the Within the Walls of York Gaol Project; a successful collaboration between York Museums Trust, the University of Glasgow and the University of York to design innovative immersive media installations specifically for a museums context. The project, led by a mixed team of specialists in human computer interaction, archaeology, exhibition design and digital arts, successfully developed innovative digital installations which demonstrated that the museum could be a 'go to' venue to experience experimental and emerging media forms. Approximately 70,000 people accessed installations produced by the team of whom 70% experienced VR for the first time. The success of the WWYG project and its predecessor Viking VR was possible because both projects were rooted in the local creative community. Through a series of networking and hack events associated with the project a diverse community developed which: (a) contributed to the WWYG project and (b) acted as a springboard for new projects and initiatives. Our research demonstrated that by engaging in dynamic and reflexive collaborative design the museum has the capacity to be a catalyst, incubator, and venue for regional digital creativity.  The goal of the Digital Creativity for Regional Museums project is to create an Immersive Media Smart Commissioning Toolkit which enables this practice to be replicated within other regional and local creative economies. The toolkit will be for use by museums and creative digital SMEs to support the initiation and co-production of immersive media projects. It will be designed to facilitate cross-institutional discourse and to enable non-specialists (in museums or immersive media) to participate meaningfully in the design process. The toolkit will be designed to support collaborative partners to engage in four forms of activity;  (1) Relationship building  (2) Idea Generation  (3) Sustainable Project Management  (4) Knowledge Exchange throughout the lifespan of a project.  Toolkit users will be guided through the creation and delivery of an immersive media project and will be prompted to engage in different forms of activity at different stages according to their needs and the needs of their partner(s). Users will also be provided with advice on using their project to drive the exchange of knowledge, ideas and skills within their regional creative economy.","The purpose of this follow-on project is to realise significant opportunities for impact identified during the Within the Walls of York Gaol project. Specifically, this project will enable the research team to develop an Immersive Media Smart Commissioning Toolkit (described above in the 'Summary' section). The purpose of the toolkit is to equip local museums and creative sector SMEs to collaborate more effectively on the development of innovative immersive media forms. The work will impact in four main areas:  1. Museums & cultural heritage sector: This project will re-frame the museum as the natural 'go-to' institution for developing and experiencing immersive media. A skills gap in the museums sector currently prevents many local and regional museums from commissioning or participating in the design of immersive media. This project will develop a toolkit to provide guidance and inspiration to museum professionals (including curators, educators, conservators and designers) which will help them to design immersive media into their existing practice and into their organisational structures. As demonstrated in the Within the Walls of York Gaol project, museums have the potential to be catalysts, incubators, and venues for digital creativity and immersive media. The toolkit will provide the guidance, support, and inspiration necessary to help museums to realise this potential.  2. Creative SMEs: The Immersive Media Smart Commissioning Toolkit will provide SMEs from the creative industries with a framework for developing compelling immersive content for and with museums. Museums are regular commissioners of small-scale digital media projects and this toolkit will provide SMEs with the knowledge necessary to pitch ideas that are innovative and appropriate for a museums setting. The Immersive Media Smart Commissioning Toolkit will bring museums and SMEs together and act as a motor; driving regional creative economies.  3. Public audiences: During the lifespan of this project two immersive experiences will be designed with local museums (with support to implement these from the research team and Museums Development Yorkshire) and one flagship immersive experience will be designed and delivered from start to finish with an SME from the creative industries. Audiences will benefit from participating in these immersive experiences, but they will also benefit from involvement in and exposure to the design process facilitated through the Immersive Media Smart Commissioning Toolkit.  4. UK Creative and Heritage Industries: The UK is home to some of the world's premier museums at national and regional levels. It has one of the most vibrant and economically successful creative sectors globally. Our research will demonstrate that museums are ideal catalysts, incubators, and venues for emerging forms of interactive and immersive media and will provide a blueprint for media development that can be replicated and adapted across the creative and heritage sectors.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS010483%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The project conducts research on the currently two largest African peace operation, the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) and the AU peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Both missions have complex mandates and combine military (combat), political (stabilisation/statebuilding) and humanitarian goals. The protection of civilians became a cornerstone of both missions.  Military peacekeepers are often required to straddle combat and pacific responsibilities, combining military, diplomatic and humanitarian roles. They fight violent actors who are often not easily distinguishable from civilians, patrol roads and convoy humanitarian deliveries, while they are simultaneously requested to develop relations with communities affected by violence, to mediate conflicts and often also to provide humanitarian goods.  The project explores how UN and AU peacekeepers in the DRC and in Somalia fulfil their protection mandate from the perspective of protection providers and protection recipients: military peacekeepers (provider), civilians (recipients) and humanitarian worker (recipients and ideally partners of peacekeepers). It will provide an in-depth and differentiated account on how military peacekeepers navigate their increasingly complex roles, swap between combat and pacific responsibilities and how their protection efforts are experienced at the recipients' end. This knowledge is crucial in improving protection efforts.  The findings of the research will be shared in round tables with all three actor groups. The round tables aim at receiving feed-back on the research. More importantly, they also aim at providing a platform for communication and at stimulating dialogue between military peacekeepers, civil humanitarian actors and civilians. Round tables will be organised by local civil society organisations who partner in the research project, and it is expected that they will uphold communication links even after the research ended.  The findings, i.e. the experiences of the providers and recipients of protection, will feed into a peacekeeping training module. The module will be developed in cooperation with the International Peace Support Training Centre (IPSTC) in Nairobi. The training will be piloted during a workshop with AU and UN trainers and representatives of military headquarters and military trainers of troop contributing countries. The evaluation of the participants will help to fine-tune the training and to finalize a training handbook that will be made publically available and shared with peacekeeping training centres and military headquarters of troop contributing countries.","The main impact of the research project is identified within four areas: First, the parallel comparison of experiences of three actor groups - peacekeepers, humanitarians, and civilians - will highlight the extent to which the experiences and perceptions of protection providers (military and non-military) match civilians' realities and civilians' (spatial) experiences of safety. Based on these findings, protection practices and outcomes will be improved by enhancing protection provider's understanding of needs of their activities' recipients. This will be done by discussing the projects' findings in the context of two roundtables bringing together A) all three actor groups and enhance their communication with each other, and B) military headquarters of troop contributing countries and peacekeeping practitioners. In addition, a training component will be developed to improve the training on civilian protection based on the research's findings. Second, the project will increase the research capacity of the local partner organisations: the South West Livestock Professional Association (Sowelpa) in Somalia and Cercle National de Réflexion sur la Jeunesse (CNRJ) in the DRC. Members of both organisations will receive training in research design, research practice, and research ethics and gain in-depth research experience. They will learn how to organise and conduct qualitative research (sampling, conducting interviews and mapping-voice) and how to analyse different types of information (interviews, maps and voices captured during the mapping exercise). Such research capacity is highly valued in both countries as international partners often rely on local organisations to conduct research. Third, a training component will be developed based on the research findings. This will be done cooperatively with the International Peace Support Training Centre (IPSTC) in Kenya and piloted in their facilities. A training handbook, Training of Trainers' handbook, and an evaluation tool will jointly be designed. These training publications will be disemminated among all peacekeeping training partners as well as the wider peacekeeping training community and will be made publicly available on the DGSi website. Fourth, another research output will be a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) module on Peacekeeping and Protection which will be directed to master-level students and practitioners (army and civilian) at the Durham Global Security Institute and at Kenyatta University. This will contribute to the institutionalisation of training pertaining to the 'military-humanitarian realm'.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT007451%2F1

Working together to explore the University of Kent's world-class music hall and pantomime collections, we will unearth histories of gender play and presentation from the Victorian era to the present and share these with the wider public. Music hall and pantomime are forms well-known for going 'beyond the binary' in exploring gender: most notably through cross-dressing but also through witty word play, songs and music. These collections therefore make an ideal focus for this project.  In the first phase of the project we will focus on investigating the materials held in the collections, and cataloguing and preserving these for future researchers. Our research team will include volunteers working in-person in the University of Kent's archives, in Canterbury, who will uncover materials for digitisation by our technician. It will also include volunteers working remotely who will explore those digitised sources using additional research resources such as the British Newspaper Archive and Ancestry. The whole research team will come together to discuss and share findings in six workshops. Our findings, both in terms of new perspectives and rediscovered materials, which will shape the content of the public engagement programme which is the focus of phase 2.  In the second phase of the project the findings around our research questions and the new materials uncovered will be brought to new audiences through our programme of public engagement. This programme includes a 'pop-up' banner exhibition which will tour to partners including the Gulbenkian Canterbury, Theatre Royal Brighton and King's Theatre Portsmouth; an interactive Hands-on History workshop presented at The Beaney, Canterbury; and a showpiece lecture-concert co-created by COI Double and the Lunatraktors, a non-binary performance duo. It will also feature comedian Mark Thomas subject to availability.  Through this ambitious programme of collaborative research and public engagement, Beyond the Binary has multiple aims. These include: - Broadening understandings and perspectives on both gender and popular performance 'then and now'.  - Improving skills, capabilities and confidence for participants. - Increasing awareness and inclusion around issues of gender and diversity. - Increasing understanding of the value of history and heritage. - Increasing audience engagement with our partners and host venues and thereby providing an economic boost to the creative and cultural industries in the wake of Covid. - Boosting research capacity and opening up new avenues of research.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX000346%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project explores the capacity of immersive technologies to inform urban regeneration strategies, by harnessing the power of cultural heritage through community advocacy. We will undertake a consultation exercise with a selection of community heritage groups with an interest in urban heritage, to identify the ways in which they could employ immersive technologies to articulate their ideas and contributions to regeneration initiatives. They frequently have a wealth of knowledge about hidden or lost heritage assets which could inform regeneration projects, but do not always have the means to disseminate this beyond websites. A handful of recent projects have employed immersive experiences, both VR and AR, to present this heritage although this has tended to be driven by SMEs or university researchers, often providing funding unavailable to community heritage groups. While this has begun to show the potential of such technologies, the means for community heritage groups to engage with such technologies themselves, or to be able to approach SMEs to develop compelling funding applications has not hitherto been scoped or shared. We will therefore consult with creative industry SMEs who possess the relevant skills set to support the development of immersive experiences by such groups. We are seeking to identify the most effective, practicable and affordable means for community heritage groups to work with creative industry SMEs to use immersive technologies to champion imaginative regeneration.  Our project is framed with respect to the expectation that clearly now exists that local councils should lie at the heart of local action, and the recognition that urban regeneration initiatives frequently see councils engaged in co-production with community groups. We will scope out opportunities and methods of working through a review of existing projects employing immersive experiences in community engagement from across the country, both those driven by community groups and those delivered by sector leaders. We will hold a focus group workshop drawing on locally-based community heritage groups with an urban regeneration focus, creative industry SMEs and academic colleagues, to inform our reporting, and provide feedback on our initial findings and to assist in finalising our recommendations. We will use our consultation to propose a roadmap, or workflow, for producing community-led immersive experiences, identifying the kinds of challenges that are part of that workflow and which companies could help to solve them, thus promoting the different creative industries that could be involved. We will disseminate the results of our work in the form of both a written report and a video showcase. It is vitally important to give community heritage groups the tools to increase their effectiveness in their contributions to the future of their towns and cities; providing a roadmap to show them what they can achieve themselves using their typically extensive knowledge of the heritage of their areas and guiding them to the resources and partnerships they need to make compelling funding applications to acquire technical support where needed.","The immediate beneficiaries of our project will be community heritage groups who are seeking to promote the heritage of the towns and cities in which they live and to advocate for this heritage to be recognised in regeneration initiatives. It is clear that local councils are increasingly likely to involve community groups in their regeneration projects, as the former have both extensive knowledge about local heritage and also a commitment to disseminating this. In this project we are developing a roadmap, or model workflow, to guide community groups in how to make use of immersive technologies to articulate their work, whether this be easily available software packages or the need to team up with creative industry sector SMEs to seek funding. The project responds to a need in the urban regeneration process to give local communities an effective voice. In a 2017 joint report by the Local Government Association, Chief Cultural & Leisure Officers Association and Arts Council England (https://www.local.gov.uk/people-culture-place-role-culture-placemaking) it was argued that community engagement should lie at the heart of successful 'placemaking', and that this requires strong partnership working. In our project we are demonstrating that immersive technologies can enable and empower local communities to engage with local government and urban regeneration initiatives, and that local councils are interested in using its capabilities. There are certainly questions about extensibility, scalability, and how to involve the creative industries more widely to develop a workflow for a range of situations, and we will scope out responses to these issues. Our project will involve consultation with community heritage groups, creative sector SMEs and those involved in urban regeneration and its outcomes will be both a written report and a video showcase to present the roadmap and also exemplars of good practice. Community heritage groups have considerable knowledge about the history and heritage of their towns and cities, and are already often engaged in disseminating this through websites they create, but there are a host of new technologies available to them that our work will identify and explain. The work we are doing will also be of value to creative industry SMEs as it articulates for them a community need and identifies how they could collaborate with community groups to develop successful funding bids to deliver immersive experiences that contribute to the urban regeneration process.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS010580%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This network seeks to increase understanding and stimulate debate about the relationship between religion and the 'sixth mass extinction' - the current phase of anthropogenic loss of biological life on Earth.  Reflecting increased awareness and public concern, the subject of extinction (including human extinction) in all of its cultural, social and ethical configurations has emerged as a pressing concern within the broader field of environmental humanities, demanding a radically cross-disciplinary approach. To date, the contribution from the study of religion has been marginal or, at best, couched within much broader discussions about diverse cultural values, ethics and practices. Religious traditions and theologies from around the world carry profound historical legacies of interpreting, observing and responding to the loss or fear of loss of life on a mass scale, including the phenomenon of species extinctions. For example, creation myths and apocalypses concerning both plenitude and the annihilation of creation; theological perspectives on the status and value of nonhuman animals; rituals and beliefs relating to death, life and rebirth; and practices of mourning and lament. It is also demonstrable that social and individual practices of human responses to extinction, such as public acts of commemoration, and rituals of lament and protest, borrow increasingly from diverse religious and spiritual traditions.  The overarching questions that this network seeks to address are: - What are the religious and theological dimensions of contemporary understandings of 'mass extinction' in all its contested scientific, ethical, political and cultural interpretations? - How is religious thought and practice impacted by public perceptions of, and encounters with, the phenomenon of mass extinction? - What is the role of religious and / or 'spiritual' belief and practice in public responses to mass extinction, from acts of mourning, lament and commemoration, to resistance and protest? Via a combination of academic research and discussion, and interactive public engagement exercises, this network will facilitate the first dedicated contribution of religious studies to the nascent field of extinction studies in the arts and humanities. Further, it will allow that scholarship to be mutually informed by the experience and understanding of extinction in the public sphere and across diverse cultural contexts. The network will fund the following events, spread over 24 months:  - Three colloquia, held at Birmingham University (with remote conference facility for several international participants). These will comprise 10 invited scholars in theology, religious studies, and philosophy of religion, as well as invited experts from neighboring disciplines engaged in extinction studies. Over the course of the colloquia we will propose, test, and develop an original piece of work, for publication as an edited collection of essays, 'Religion and Extinction'. We will launch the book in the last phase of the network project. - Two 'creative conversation' events, co-organised with our project partners, Encounter Arts - hosting conversations between academics and members of the public around the issue of extinction and religious faith and practice. The location and activity (e.g. a walk) accompanying the conversation will be designed to maximize creative reflection. - Submission of a major RCUK grant application, which will build upon the findings and momentum from the network activities to develop in greater depth a specific aspect of the network, and focusing on the subject of Skrimshire's current research: the development of the first 'political theology of extinction'; that is, developing the resources of Christian political and eco-theology in the light of contemporary narratives of mass extinction.  - Launch of Extinction Studies working group of the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and culture, annual conference 2019.","The core aim of the network is to stimulate discussion - both in academic and in wider public settings, and bridging these two contexts - about the religious dimension of social and cultural responses to mass extinction. Thus the network will benefit a wide range of public, non-academic audiences who are engaged, whether personally or collectively, with furthering knowledge, understanding, and forming practical responses to the phenomenon of extinction. Through the combination of our research activities, there will be a close integration of the academic research and its dissemination and participation in discussions about the link between religious concepts, beliefs and practices, and mass extinction. The project will generate public awareness and education impacts as well as more specific third sector practitioner impacts.  Through close collaboration with Encounter Arts, this research network will reach out to members of the general public in local communities who are seeking to formulate a response to mass extinction. We will collaboratively curate ""creative conversations"" in order to share the learning in the context of these groups with a wider public audience. Through these events, participants will benefit from a more trans-disciplinary exploration of the role that religious faith plays in activist practice along with practitioners in public arts, including our project partners in EA, but also extending to other teams producing theatrical and artistic projects that seek to stimulate public action and engage people with complex emotions and opinions linked to ecological loss. The project will thusly generate public education impacts, raising awareness of the religious dimensions of public response to extinction. Project research will also help to resource NGOs working to galvanise public awareness and action in response to ecological change. These non-academic beneficiaries fall into two main camps: 1) Non-Governmental Organisations and Faith-Based Organisations : Christian Aid, CAFOD, A'Rocha International, Stop Climate Chaos, Green Peace, RSPB, WWF, Friends of the Earth; 2) third sector practitioners working in community arts, environmental education, cultural heritage (including: Permaculture Society, The Conservation Volunteers, ONCA gallery in Brighton). Project findings will be distilled into a brief plain-language green paper which can serve to illuminate the significance and specific characteristics of engagement with extinction for religious groups in Britain. We have designed the research to include input from a range of non-scholarly voices in the form of feedback loops drawn in from the Creative Conversations. In addition, many of the scholars invited to contribute to the project are, as already mentioned, drawing insights from fieldwork that includes engagement with NGO and FBO activism (e.g. Kidwell). In this way we hope the edited volume which will result from the core research activity will have a broader public reach than its immediate academic beneficiaries, by reflecting on the experiences of practitioners 'in the field'. Both project PI and Co-I have extensive experience with profile-raising activities on the subject of religion with secular environmental NGOs (Stop Climate Chaos, Green Peace, RSPB, WWF, Friends of the Earth, etc.) and in providing scholarly input towards campaign and strategic planning with religious NGOs in the UK (A'Rocha, Eco-Congregation Scotland). These strategic links will provide an ideal avenue towards dissemination which can aid in raising public awareness and sharpening campaigns highlighting extinction towards more successful outcomes.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR014612%2F1

This has been subsequently developed in team meetings and email exchanges. The aim is to develop the notion of hydrocitizenship through a multi-faceted programme of arts and humanities research in collaboration with other related disciplines - particularly geography, planning, landscape design and community studies. This research will involve non HEI partners (Landscape Institute) and will be co-developed with key stakeholders including the Environment Agency, local authorities other water/environment focused agencies. It will be located in three major national science and research contexts; United Kingdom Water Research and Innovation Framework (UKWRIF); National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA), and Making Space for Water (DEFRA 2005). The development programme will explore basic questions about how arts and humanities centred interdisciplinary research can investigate conflicts, issues and potentials relating to water resources and within communities. And from that base, make a difference in communities in terms of both social and environmental transition and resilience. Broader findings regarding the co-development of social and environmental sustainability in communities in the UK will be disseminated to both academic and policy communities. The research will focus on how a range of values, such as sense of place, can be integrated into emerging polcy/goverencance agenca of ecosystems services and cultural ecosystem services.   A basic tenet of this proposal is that thinking beyond the social is a vital element of any large Connected Communities initiative which seeks to address questions of sustainability. Communities are often not aware of the systems which bring them a range of ecosystem services (and risk e.g. flooding) and this includes hydro-social cycles. Water is taken as a fundamental and pressing area of environmental concern and social justice. Questions of water security (flood, drought, water quality, access, water based ecosystem services) are some of the most important facing communities today in the UK and globally. Water issues interconnect local, regional, national, and global territories, and relate to multiple eco-social interdependences within and between communities. They also ask challenging questions about what communities are, how they work internally, how they are embedded in wider networks of connectivity (e.g. in river catchments). Water issues also offer very palpable examples of how individuals and communities (human and non-human) depend on, and are linked by, physical processes. Water is a particularly accessible way to engage communities with questions of sustainability in relation to a range of high profile eco-social challenges. We also seek to explore the challenges and benefits of moving water focused research from single issue foci (flood, drought) to a holistic approach, and how can the arts and humanties research play a central part in this?","The focus on crosscutting understandings of communities in general and how various disciplines and initiatives have considered communities and water issues (and other environmental issues) will have impact for the following stakeholders: Those seeking to develop community well being and the effectiveness of public services and policy, and enhancing quality of life, health and creative output in relation to communities. Private sector beneficiaries will include stakeholder organisations with interest in economic aspects of resilience particularly insurance companies and their representative bodies.  public sector beneficiaries, policy-makers, government and government agencies will include a range of governmental and ngo agencies with interest in community well-being and resilience and also in various aspects of sustainable environmental management, including those charged with climate change scenario planning third sector agencies will include museums and other organisations which might have a role in developing and disseminating community narratives . The emphasis on therapeutic narratives will be of interest to a range of actors who might seek to work with communities, including artists and socially engaged arts practitioners, civil society and third sector agencies involved in social welfare, as well as local communities and community organisations situated in fractured hydro-social relations.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK003992%2F1

Recent technological advances permit the opening of archives beyond those specialists who previously had sole access to manuscripts, initially by the provision of high quality digital images which allow any interested viewer to see such manuscripts and subsequently through the addition of further digital tools which aim to facilitate engagement with the medieval past in ways not previously possible.  The current research project constructs a digital edition of one such set of manuscripts, the Estoria de Espanna - a thirteenth-century chronicle of Spain. Building on the research of the edition, we now aim to add a range of tools and activities in order to engage a wider public in the world of medieval texts and history. The tools in question will be adapted to serve and engage two different, and complementary, groups: (i) the public who visit libraries and exhibitions in Spain and the US and (ii) secondary school students in Spain. The tools will cover 4 key areas: (1) Contextual historical information on the Estoria de Espanna, its composition and contents. (2) Contextual information on Alfonso el Sabio, author of the chronicle. (3) Mapping and visualisation tools which will allow non-specialists to access the text of the Estoria from non-traditional perspectives. (4) Digital activities on five sections of the Estoria. Manuscript images of five sections of the Estoria will be available to all users of the digital tools and these sections of the respective manuscripts will also be on display at the simultaneous physical exhibitions at the Biblioteca Nacional de España, the Universidad de Salamanca, the Biblioteca Menéndez Pelayo in Santander and the University of Minnesota. The public will be engaged by means of a digital exhibition which will accompany the physical display of the manuscripts of the Estoria de Espanna in our partner institutions: the National Library of Spain in Madrid, the University of Salamanca and the Biblioteca Menéndez Pelayo in Santander in Spain and the University of Minnesota Library in Minneapolis in December 2016, to coincide with the launch of the digital edition. In concert with the University of Sheffield's Humanities Research Institute, we will provide interactive material to (i) inform the public about the context of thirteenth-century Castile and León; (ii) connect members of the public in Spain with their shared past; (iii) challenge mis-conceptions about medieval Iberia and manuscript culture and (iv) engage the public with text and space by means of visualisation tools; (v) engage non-academic partners in the research-led activities of the Estoria Digital project.  The secondary school students will have the benefit of the same material, but this will be adapted to their specific needs. In concert with our partners in four schools in Spain we will develop specific learning exercises on five key sections of the chronicle (which will be available both in digital images and as the folios on display in the exhibitions). These will (i) challenge the students' pre-conceptions about the history of medieval Iberia and the sophistication of historical writing in the thirteenth century; (ii) expose the students to the depth and breadth of manuscript culture in Spain and (iii) engage the students in questions of literary and linguistic analysis emerging from the sections in question.","The project will build upon and give concrete realisation to the Impact aims of the original project. Whereas the Impact plan of the edition foresaw the provision of digital materials and tools in itself as a means to engage non-academic audiences, the current proposal goes beyond this by seeking actively to engage key groups: (i) heritage organisations, (ii) an educated public who visit library exhibitions and (iii) secondary school students. The project will seek to challenge deeply-held misconceptions about the nature of medieval manuscript culture and history and to engage the interest of the public in the reality of the medieval world. Fictional representations of medieval worlds, especially in the form of film, demonstrate that there is a public thirst for knowledge about the Middle Ages; the project aims to take advantage of this demand from new audiences by employing visual, digital means of access to non-fictional examples of medieval history, life and culture. The digital tools and materials developed in the project will therefore seek to challenge notions of past, present and future by taking unique medieval manuscripts beyond the archive and decoding them for a wider public.  In response to suggestions emerging from discussions with the Biblioteca Nacional, project members identified a number of ways in which targeted impact could be achieved. Visitors to Libraries will benefit in the following ways: the juxtaposition of the original codices and the digital materials will provide a connection between artefact and explanation. The online tool developed to explain and challenge notions of medieval textuality will be available to download for all visitors, and will therefore serve as a means of active engagement for those who are unable to visit the physical exhibitions. The engagement with the physical object in the exhibition will therefore be extended beyond the life of the exhibition though the online presence. Visitors will, in consequence, be encouraged to play an active role in the preservation of the past and be challenged to consider the interplay of past and present. The Biblioteca Nacional exhibition space has a monthly footfall of 20,000 visitors from all parts of the public and distinguished visitors. The Universidad de Salamanca exhibition space has an annual footfall of 3.5k visitors and is regularly visited by Heads of State and government, policy makers and distinguished guests to the University. We aim therefore to influence a range of actors in the social life of Spain and beyond. School children will benefit from the direct digital access to materials usually out of sight in archives. The digital exercises in literary, palaeographical and historical analysis, based on the categories of the digital exhibition, will aim to change perceptions of medieval culture as remote and difficult and to engender a sense of excitement in the relevance of centuries-old artefacts. The pilot schools chosen, with one exception, are in Madrid or close by, so the students will initially be able to have access to the physical exhibition also. As the materials will be provided in both Spanish and English, they will be available subsequently for use in the undergraduate classroom in the English-speaking world also.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN006658%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Singing is receiving growing attention in both popular culture and academe as an activity that offers numerous benefits for wellbeing (Clift, 2012) throughout life. From the participatory arts events offered by leading arts organisations like the LSO to community choirs and singing initiatives for people affected by social or health issues, there have never been so many opportunities to join in. However, many adults exclude themselves from singing. About 17% of people self-define as 'tone deaf' (Cuddy et al 2005) and probably many more as 'non-singer'. Non-singers often feel regret and social embarrassment (Knight 1999), holding negative associations and beliefs about their own singing ability and voice (Numminen 2005). Many, though not all, sing less well than average adults (Wise & Sloboda 2008). Against a discourse of 'anyone can sing', non-singers hold a powerful narrative that says 'you can either sing or you can't - and I can't'. The project focuses on people who are disenfranchised from singing, engaging them in specially designed intervention programmes. It combines psychological, educational and artistic research to give an integrated understanding of the journeys adult non-singers take in learning to sing, and the ways in which they can be supported.  Although there is ample evidence that singing skill is open to improvement, there is little research on how this happens. While we know that non-singers' self-image and confidence can be improved by supportive opportunities (Richards & Durrant 2003), knowledge is limited about how these changes, along with improvements in skills, are related to specific learning activities and contexts. Meanwhile, the professional craft knowledge of singing teachers, who often report success in teaching those with singing difficulties, is largely undocumented. Psychological research in laboratory settings has elucidated the role of pitch and melody processing in vocal pitching. The ability to sing in tune has little to do with pitch perception per se and more to do with the complex co-ordination of perception and action. Recent evidence suggests one important aspect of this co-ordination may be auditory imagery - the ability to imagine music in one's mind. This offers an exciting point of contact with practice, since imagery is widely used in singing teaching. The project will integrate hitherto rather separate areas of research and practice, and move beyond pitch accuracy as the primary measure of 'good' singing to reflect the multifaceted nature of singing as a means of expression and communication.  Based at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, the project mobilises the expertise of specialist teachers, music psychologists, a software designer and a composer-animateur. It is organised into two strands. Strand 1 is a singing course including individual tuition and group sessions, as well as a final performance produced collaboratively by the participants and teachers. It will include repertoire chosen to suit the singers and original material created under the leadership of a composer-animateur, based on participants' reflections on their own singing journeys. Participants in Strand 2 undertake training in the privacy of their own home. A mobile app will be designed to train auditory imagery and a controlled experiment will test whether this improves singing skills. If successful, an app offers huge potential for a scientifically validated self-help tool. The project will apply a battery of measures before and after training to investigate how adults progress in the many dimensions of singing skill, and how their self-views and attitudes towards singing change. It will also collect video data and qualitative accounts of the learning process, to identify the types of educational approaches, musical materials and activities that are associated with measurable developments in skill and with satisfying artistic, social and personal experiences.","The ambitious multi-disciplinary, collaborative approach to the proposed project builds on the formation of an Adult Non-singers' Network, an international group of 35 practitioners and researchers with expertise in singing and vocal training, speech therapy, drama, psychology, neuropsychology, music education and software development. They work in HE institutions, industry, adult education (including Morley College, known for its 'tone deaf' choirs) and private practice. At the inaugural meeting at the Guildhall School, 2014, the network shared research and practical insights to discuss interventions for adult non-singers; this project has grown from discussions held in that forum. The Network is an ideal context for knowledge exchange, and will be instrumental in developing pathways for engagement through its diverse practitioner and academic membership. The project will bring new opportunities for dialogue and knowledge exchange, to support best practice and move towards a common language so that everyone involved with adult non-singers may benefit.  The project will address barriers that prevent a sizeable number of people from accessing the increasing opportunities to participate in singing. It will point to ways in which sustainable entry-points into artistic, social and cultural life can be created, as well as essential disinhibition. In identifying the kinds of musical activities and contexts that are beneficial to non-singers, and the precise outcomes of different approaches to intervention, the project will provide a valuable resource to those involved in voice work with adult novices, whether in private practice, adult education, or community settings. Through the Guildhall School's partnerships with the Barbican and the LSO, via their respective outreach arms Creative Learning and LSO Discovery, the project will engage with leading arts organisations to stimulate discussion on strategies for engaging and meeting the needs of non-singers in participatory arts work. Recent high-profile media coverage of Gareth Malone's community and workplace singing projects, the promotion of singing in connection with a wide range of personal, social and health issues, and the large public interest, make this project timely. The City of London Festival for example, is holding a 'Day of Extraordinary Choirs' of people affected by cancer, homelessness, and mental illness. While many research initiatives have focused on the therapeutic benefits of singing for narrowly defined constituencies, such the ill or marginalised in society, this project has a much wider agenda. It reaches out to the large numbers of the general public who might benefit from the routes to self-exploration and expression, positive identity and wellbeing offered by artistic vocal activities.  In making visible the journeys of adult non-singers, the project will demonstrate the possibilities for change. This could be a powerful means of changing attitudes and addressing misconceptions. The project may also offer the possibility for assessment measures to be adapted for self-test, giving people who worry about their singing an objective view of their skills. The development of a mobile app will act as a trial of the viability of this medium for developing training tools for the general public. If successful, a digital interface has the potential to reach many more people than traditional face-to-face tuition and group participation. Giving a 'safe', private means of trying out singing and receiving credible guidance and feedback, it may also be a powerful tool for arts organisations to engage people who would usually be too anxious to come to participatory events. The wider availability of evidence-based and theoretically grounded assessment tools could provide the first step towards changing someone's self-perceptions and increasing his/her skills, sufficiently for that person to make the transition to singing with others, and all that that entails.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN005775%2F1

This story cycle, told in at least 30 languages from Central Asia to Iceland over more than five centuries, recounts a medieval #metoo story of a fake rape accusation between a mute prince and his young stepmother at a royal court, and the impossibility of establishing the truth. We will reappraise the text's gender politics from the perspective of recent gender studies. Most of the versions have not yet been edited or even identified, and we will take a first step towards this by collating and expanding the available factual information on the transmission. We will also edit one of The Seven Sages' earliest versions from a multilingual hub, the Dutch tradition. Seeing each of the different versions as part of a transcultural rather than monolingual tradition will give new impulses to the study of medieval and early modern literature. Our edition and repertory of versions will be freely available online for anyone wanting to find out more about our shared transcultural rather than national or ""Western"" history. Academics from across the different national philologies concerned, as well as from medieval and early modern studies and gender studies generally will benefit from this project's practical and theoretical groundwork.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX001873%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              It is hard to measure the most important things that educators and stakeholders want to know about the effectiveness of art-based learning and engagement. Engagement, inspiration and active learning are high priorities for museums and galleries, but methods for evaluating them often lack a sense of the richness of participants' experience. New approaches for evaluation of engagement are needed. In particular, more can be done to leverage the profound rethinking of place and space that has come along with digital incursions into our day-to-day lives. The problem to be addressed in this research is that the significance of 'place' - imagined and real - is not being built upon to inform the evaluation of engagement with cultural heritage. A theoretical perspective drawing on mobilities theory, which focuses on tracing trajectories, networks, and the movement of people and objects, will be used to reimagine arts evaluation.  This project will develop, test and assess 'artcasting', a new digital and mobile form of evaluation of arts-based engagement, in the context of ARTIST ROOMS On Tour (AROT). ARTIST ROOMS is a collection of more than 725 works of international contemporary art acquired in 2008 by National Galleries of Scotland and Tate. It is being shared throughout the UK in a programme of exhibitions organised in collaboration with local galleries of all sizes. AROT aims to ensure the collection engages new, young audiences, and this will be mirrored in this project by a focus on young people (ages 13-25). Artcasting involves the visitor in selecting an image of an artwork from a ROOM, and digitally 'casting' it outward to another location, where it can be received on mobile devices in the future (see visual evidence). The artwork will be linked with a significant place in the mind of the visitor, evoking memories and emotions, and supporting lasting learning. In addition, through brief stories visitors record about their choice of location, artcasting shows how the impact of an exhibition may be extended imaginatively and literally through space and time. Artcasting simultaneously encourages visitors to make connections and reflect on what they have experienced, and captures those connections for sharing, analysis and evaluation. In this way, it challenges dominant approaches that separate engagement from evaluation.  The objectives of the project are to understand how mobilities approaches can enrich arts evaluation; to design, develop and pilot the artcasting platform; to generate a new approach to evaluation that can be built upon in the future; and to influence ARTIST ROOMS evaluation practice. These objectives will be met through a three-stage research process involving qualitative methods and a design-based approach to generating, piloting and evaluating artcasting prototypes. Methods will include interviews, workshops with young visitors, iterative design of the artcasting application, in-gallery observations, and analysis of usage data and user-generated content shared by artcasting users. This project is interdisciplinary, involving researchers from Digital Education and Design Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, and drawing in expertise from the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate, associate galleries and young people. It will contribute to scholarly and practical understanding of cultural heritage evaluation of learning and engagement.","The following groups and organisations will benefit from this research within the project funding period (2015-16):  - The network of sixty-six associate galleries across the UK which have hosted ARTIST ROOMS exhibitions, and galleries which subsequently join the network.  - The National Galleries of Scotland and Tate, joint hosts of ARTIST ROOMS. - Cultural heritage educators, such as those represented by the 'engage' network. These groups will be invited to attend workshops, participate in regular Twitter chats, and engage with the project team via the web site and blog. The project's steering group includes representatives from each group, and will ensure that emerging opportunities to engage with the wider groups are taken up. The key anticipated impact of this project is an influence on evaluation practice amongst these groups, leading to a greater enthusiasm for the possibilities of evaluation, and a new mobilities-based framework with which to explore those possibilities, and ultimately to more digital innovations like artcasting. Researchers in the fields of arts evaluation, museum and gallery learning, and digital education (see academic beneficiaries) will be able to engage with and benefit from the project from the outset, with the publicly available and continually updated web site, and regular events such as the Twitter chats open to all interested participants. The project's dissemination strategy aims to ensure that these three fields are targeted via conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.  Software developers and programmers will engage with the project through the open hack event, and this will extend the reach of the project's activities and findings to the technology sector. The artcasting application will be preserved and shared, benefiting other developers and researchers interested in this type of intervention. In the longer term, the project will be of use to funding bodies, policymakers and cultural heritage organisational leadership involved in making decisions about evaluation practice in museums and galleries, by providing robust, well-theorised evidence of the impact of innovation on evaluation in the context of a major national exhibition.  Finally, evaluation approaches which build on this research will positively impact upon the experience of museum and gallery users, as galleries learn more about what engages and inspires audiences. Ultimately, the project aims to enrich cultural heritage engagement and learning for members of the public.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM008177%2F1

It will support Glastonbury Abbey to transform its visitor offer towards self-exploration in a safe, open-air environment and to expand the 'explorer family' audience segment through interactive visitor participation and location-based gameplay. It responds directly to challenges to the heritage sector resulting from COVID-19, by developing a more resilient visitor offer tailored to the audience segment with most potential to grow during post-COVID recovery. The project will create an Augmented Reality app that draws on the original archaeological research and provides a narrative structure for storytelling that interacts with live (costumed) performance and interactive family trails. It will guide visitors through the physical spaces of the monastic precinct, providing an opportunity for family trails involving role play of historical characters. It harnesses archaeological evidence for monastic life beyond the cloister, including Glastonbury's exceptional abbot's 'palace', its extensive facilities for hospitality and charity, and the agricultural resources of the outer court. It will reveal how spatial access to monastic zones was regulated according to a medieval person's social identity, whether monk, servant, male or female, adult or child, pilgrim or patron. This approach provides an opportunity for more inclusive interpretation of a medieval monastery, contrasting the experience of (male) monks with a diverse range of medieval characters. The app, in combination with trail-finding and costumed performance and demonstrations, will encourage visitors to explore Glastonbury Abbey's wider monastic precinct of 36 acres, moving beyond the core area of the monastic church and Lady Chapel. It will offer multi-vocality both in the degree of agency exercised by the user, and in the range of historical voices represented. The project team combines expertise from Archaeology, Heritage and Creative Industries, building on the PI's long-standing collaboration with Glastonbury Abbey, and introducing collaborating organisations Arcade (a digital practice that designs immersive experiences) and Thread (specialist conservation and design architects). The team will address the design challenges and potential solutions for immersive heritage practices in open-air sites. They will develop stational markers that signal the boundaries between monastic zones and provide essential information for the app's self-exploration and role-play options. Extensive pilot work will develop light-touch, imaginative solutions suitable for a Scheduled Monument. The narrative and game mechanics for the AR app will be refined through two stages of on-site testing and evaluation using family groups. Two Knowledge Exchange workshops will co-create approaches for Glastonbury Abbey's Living History team to interact with and complement the AR app. They will also feature as characters in the app's narrative, providing a direct and embodied connection between the digital and real worlds. These opportunities for knowledge exchange will inform the design of Glastonbury Abbey's marketing campaign for the AR app and their development of family trail activity packs. Glastonbury Abbey will integrate the app in their interpretation policy and in the daily work of the Living History team, and they will fund ongoing support and upgrades for the app. They will develop ongoing event programmes and marketing to sustain visitor numbers, with the aim of doubling the family explorer audience segment within three years.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW002787%2F1

An experienced, cross-disciplinary team opens up three unique collections, located in Europe, with extremely rare music and sound from Southeast Asia (SEA), that have worldwide fame in terms of their quality, quantity and diversity, but are barely accessible. DeCoSEAS facilitates: physical access for SE Asian stakeholders (WP1), online access for scholars, artists and stakeholders worldwide (WP2), publication channels about heritage curation for SE Asian stakeholders (WP3) and outreach projects for culture consumers worldwide (WP4). Each WP is devised to achieve corresponding objectives: 1. Interrogate the colonial patrimony of archives, 2. Conceive a new digital curational framework, 3. Transfer publishing and editing agencies about heritage curation to heritage stakeholders, and 4. Democratize curatorial practices. The objectives constitute DeCoSEAS envisaged decolonization of heritage curation that acutely responds to current public and academic debates on de/colonization and heritage restitution. The project is a pilot study for this vision adopting a knowledge chain with three formative orientation points: the improvement of access to heritage, the transfer of agency to stakeholders of heritage, and the diversification of the dialogue about heritage curation. DeCoSEAS employs a paradigm-shifting methodological approach focused on hearing and listening as dialogical modes of knowledge formation. It complements conventional academic faculties of watching and reading as modes of singular objectification. DeCoSEAS strives for the inclusion of voices, stances and interpretations that have hitherto remained unheard in existing discourses about heritage by attending to multiple, time-bound and intricately entangled voices simultaneously (those recorded from the past and those from SE Asian partners today). With these action plans, DeCoSEAS aims to provide new insights in and new practices of heritage curation and participation.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW000393%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Until quite recently art crime has been a relatively neglected topic of scholarly and practitioner attention. Dramatic art heists, clever art forgeries and like criminal activities have been the frequent grist for works of fiction in print and on screen. However, academics and practitioners alike have remained somewhat aloof from any detailed analysis of and response to this type of criminal behaviour. In an international art market that is currently reaching record levels of pricing and unprecedented levels of speculative sales and investment the incentives for this type of crime have, however, never been higher. Some commentators even estimate that art crime represents the third most serious form of transnational crime after drug and arms trafficking.  The main problem in tackling art crime is the variety of different actors involved and the significant expertise required. Buyers need to realise whether a painting is stolen or forged; auction houses have to find out whether an artifact has been looted and police and customs have to identify stolen or forged objects. To detect art crime a high level of expertise is required that is present in the art market, but not necessarily within law enforcement agencies. A substantial proportion of art crime today also involves multiple jurisdictions, however, most national police forces have little or no special resources allocated to this area and cooperation is difficult both with other jurisdictions and with the private sector. Understanding art crime involves at minimum aspects of criminology, art history, the art trade, archaeology, art law, police and security studies, anthropology, sociology, museum studies, and insurance law. This area is par excellence one of interdisciplinary perspectives. However, there is a tendency both for academics and professionals to be hesitant about stepping outside their area of specialisation making it difficult to create a complete picture of the prevalence, offenders, motives and impacts of this type of crime. Bringing the different representatives of academic disciplines and practitioners together to exchange knowledge and experience on the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of art crime is therefore crucial to tackle art crime successfully. The networking activity will focus on three broad and principal subject areas - art theft and vandalism, art fraud and forgery, and the plunder, looting and destruction of antiquities. It will bring together policymakers, practitioners and researcher to explore central issues, including: 1. What is the prevalence of art crime? Who are the principal participants and what are the economic drivers of this activity? 2. Where are the principle markets based and how are stolen, forged and looted objects placed on the market? 3. Are existing security measures able to protect against art theft, forgeries and looting? 4. To what extent are existing regulatory mechanisms effective and is self-regulation of the art market the way forward? 5. What scientific measures can be taken to better protect the art market? 6. How should identified fraudulent/stolen works of art be dealt with? 7. How can the legal and financial risks in authenticating works of art be mitigated? 8. How is art crime related to organised crime, money-laundering, corruption and the funding of terrorism? 9. What are the principle barriers that exist to recovery and repatriation? 10. What existing public education models to change attitudes might be adopted? The network will draw upon experiences from different jurisdictions, including the United States, Australasia, China, Germany and Italy. International actors (eg World Customs Organisation, Interpol, International Council of Museums) will further inform discussion. The network will engage different academic disciplines (law, archaeology, criminology, art history, art conservation sciences and psychology) and key stakeholders from policy and practice.","Academic impact of the new knowledge generated in this unique, innovative inter-disciplinary collaboration that will create traditional academic research outputs encompasses the disciplines of criminology, art history, the art trade, archaeology, art law, police and security studies, anthropology, sociology, museum studies, and insurance law.  Practical knowledge and guidelines for policy makers and practitioners to respond to, and help to prevent, reduce and react to the changing and growing global threat of art crime which is estimated to be worth £8 billion pounds per annum globally and £300 million pounds per annum in the UK will also be developed. This network will be of interest to policymakers and practitioners working in the area of art and heritage crimes, financial crimes, money laundering, corruption and terrorist financing. These stakeholders include: the Home Office, Metropolitan Police Service, the English Heritage, the National Police Chiefs Association, to name but a few. Leading practitioners in private practice will also be interested in the work of this network. Beyond the UK, key stakeholders include Interpol, Europol, the World Customs Organisation, the International Council of Museums, UNESCO, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. These institutions are driving art crime legislation, prevention and investigations and respond more generally to the transnational phenomena of art crime. Outputs impacting on both the academic, policy and practitioner environments include: 1. Three workshops exploring key issues of art crime.  2. Briefing document following these workshops which will inform future research and policy-discourse.  3. Podcasts of the workshops will also be made available online.  4. Dedicated panels on art crime will be convened at leading academic conferences and practitioner-focused conferences.  5. There will also be publications in international peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed outlets as well as an edited collection. The listed outputs offer potential to develop and improve approaches to training and professional development of those responsible for preventing art crime across the world, as well as university level taught courses in law, criminology and art. AHRC support for this network will facilitate an effective collaboration, potentially of global significance, which will be a powerful case study of the impact and effectiveness of the application of AHRC funded research in countering the growing phenomena of art crime. This network will focus on a number of under-explored issues - which have been identified in consultation with stakeholders from, inter alia, the Metropolitan Police Service, Tate Gallery, The Art Management Group, the Museum Security Network and CS Consulting. Discussion will focus on: 1. What is the prevalence of art crime? Who are the principal participants and what are the economic drivers of this activity? 2. Where are the principle markets based and how are stolen, forged and looted objects placed on the market? 3. Are existing security measures able to protect against art theft, forgeries and looting? 4.

The Western Arctic rim of North America is considered the climate change ""miners canary"", with temperatures increasing at twice the global average. In the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (Y-K Delta), Western Alaska, the indigenous Yup'ik Eskimos are facing life-altering decisions in an uncertain future, as rising temperatures, melting permafrost and coastal erosion threaten traditional subsistence lifeways, livelihoods and settlements - the Yup'ik face becoming ""the world's first climate change refugees"" (The Guardian 2008).  For the Yup'ik, however - whose relationship to the total environment is central to their worldview - coping with global climate change entails far more than adapting to new physical and ecological conditions. This is reflected in the holistic incorporation of both natural and social phenomena embodied in the use of the Yup'ik word ella, (variably translating as ""weather"", ""world"", ""universe"", ""awareness""), which is understood in intensely social as well as physical terms. Ella reflects the relationship Yup'ik society has with the natural world. As changing environmental conditions jeopardise traditional subsistence practices in the Arctic, their deep-rooted dependency and social connection to the land is also threatened - further severing their ecological ties and compromising their cultural adaptive capacity that has defined Yup'ik community and identity for thousands of years. Rapid climatic change is by no means a uniquely modern phenomenon and the indigenous cultures of this region have faced such life-changing situations before. In fact, Western Alaska has experienced pronounced climatic variations within the last millennia, with the forebears of the Yup'ik being similarly challenged by regime shifts that would have influenced the availability of important subsistence resources, much the same as their descendants face today.  The ELLA project will use both the products and processes of archaeological research to understand how Yup'ik Eskimos adapted to rapid climate change in the late prehistoric past (AD 1350-1700), and to inform and empower descendant Yup'ik communities struggling with contemporary global warming today. Taking full advantage of the spectacular but critically endangered archaeological resource now emerging from melting permafrost along the Bering Sea coast, this community-based project will illuminate the adaptive capacity of the precontact Yup'ik; build sustainable frameworks for the documenting of local sites under threat; and reinforce Yup'ik cultural resilience by providing new contexts for encountering and documenting their past.","Who will benefit from this research? 1.Climate scientists and social scientists interested in the localised effects of past climate change on Arctic ecosystems and on the human populations living in the Arctic. 2.Heritage managers (e.g. policy-makers, third sector/non-profit organisations, land-owning Native corporations) interested in developing local, economically-sustainable strategies for managing threatened cultural resources, particularly in coastal regions. 3.Local communities, including the public, school-aged children, local non-profit organisations (i.e. Tribal Councils). 4.Artisans and traditional craftspeople interested in rediscovering technique and design of precontact material culture. 5.The media and the wider international public, students and school-level audiences. 6.PDRA staff and PhD students employed on the project. How will they benefit from this research? 1.Generation of new palaeoenvironmental proxy data pertaining to the localised effects of past climatic changes on Arctic ecosystems, and past human responses to those fluctuating climatic conditions, illuminating cultural resilience and adaptation. 2.Provide models/guidelines for economically-sustainable protocols for dealing with damage to cultural sites from coastal erosion, and providing primary heritage management advice to remote, coastal communities. 3.Public engagement/outreach events will raise local heritage awareness and practically help to preserve cultural heritage via community archaeology/participation. This project will also create new avenues for imparting traditional indigenous knowledge to younger people raised in an increasingly westernised cultural environment. 4.Recovery of high quality artwork and craft items from archaeological sites that are not extant or rarely encountered in ethnographic museum collections 5.Inform general public audiences of the issues of climatic change in an accessible way, presenting the 'human face' of climate change, and making the public aware of future vulnerabilities and coping mechanisms. 6.Provide training in research specialisms for PDRAs/PhD students, and help develop advanced teamwork, presentation and oral communication skills. What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research? 1.Routine academic dissemination activities through peer-reviewed journals, conference participation, book chapters/conference proceedings, etc. 2.Production and distribution of Community Handbook for Threatened Archaeological Sites, including deposition on ADS for long term, open access.  3.Local outreach events, emphasising community-led archaeology and building cultural heritage awareness, in both Alaska and Scotland, including annual ELLA Community Workshops. At such events we will incorporate 'hands-on' experiences with artefacts, as well as the use of tablet displays for 'no touch, hands on' interaction. Workshop reports will also be deposited on ADS for open access. Participation in formal education programmes (e.g. KuC's Summer Science Camp) and generation/distribution of education packages for schools will ensure wider educational benefits of this project. 4.Traditional craftspeople will be included in community workshops and given access to recovered collections. 5.Following on from recent press interest (e.g. BBC) further press releases will be made during the project. Open access publication/general interest publications (e.g. Scientific American, National Geographic, etc) will target non-specialist audiences. Existing project web pages will be maintained and regularly updated on the University of Aberdeen Department of Archaeology website in order to target the wider global community and our highly successful fieldwork project blog (www.nunalleq.wordpress.com) will be maintained both during and between periods of fieldwork. 6.PDRAs/PhD students will take an active role in dissemination activities (academic and public engagement and outreach) as well as core research.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK006029%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              A notorious complicating factor in language comes from inflectional morphology, which is all the more striking because some languages have it and others do not. In English, for example, verbs inflect, and alongside a form such as 'sing', a speaker must know 'sings', 'sang', 'sung' and 'singing'. In Mandarin Chinese, where verbs do not inflect, a speaker only needs to know one form (chàng). But inflection is not just a matter of learning multiple forms -- speakers also need to negotiate a network of unpredictable and ambiguous relationships. For instance, English speakers do not just need to know that a verb must have a simple past tense form, they need to know that the past tense forms of 'sing', 'fling', 'bring' and 'ping' are all constructed in different ways ('sang', 'flung', 'brought' and 'pinged'), and that while 'sang' and 'hang' rhyme, one is a past tense form and the other present. While the inflectional system of English is still fairly simple, in other languages things may get considerably more complex. One of the world's most extreme examples comes from Nuer, a language of the West Nilotic branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family, mainly spoken in the Republic of South Sudan. This complexity is not due so much to a large number of forms, but rather to their unpredictability and internal structure. This can be clearly seen in the case suffixes. On the face of it, the system is quite simple. There just two suffixes, -ka in the singular and -ni in the plural. But their behaviour is quite baffling, because their meaning varies according to the individual noun; for example, -ni can function as a genitive case suffix for some nouns, as a locative case for others, or as both, or even as a general plural suffix with no case-marking function at all. Speakers must learn how to use and recognize these forms, and select the correct function from this range of competing options. Besides suffixation, nouns may also inflect through various internal changes, as with English 'foot' versus 'feet'. But in Nuer this goes well beyond such vocalic alternations, and takes advantage of a rich system of prosodic features such as length, tone, and phonation type (breathy voice versus creaky voice). As with the suffixes, it is not possible to establish a fixed function for these features. For example, the genitive case of 'cow' is formed by vowel lengthening (yang ~ yaang) while that of 'person' is formed by shortening (raan ~ ran). Taken together, the patterns of suffixation and word-internal changes constitute a system whose complexity is matched by few languages in the world. This is of major interest both to the study of language and of cognition more generally, because the reigning linguistic and psychological models of inflection are based on systems which are considerably simpler. But while we know enough about the language to appreciate the challenges it poses, we lack any detailed information. Very little about it is known about Nuer outside the speech community, and the existing descriptions are sketchy at best. Therefore, in this project we aim to produce the first comprehensive description of the inflectional morphology of Nuer, based on original fieldwork, at the same time illuminating aspects of its sound system, syntax and historical development. Alongside the structural complexities of the system, the prosodic system poses particular descriptive challenges of its own, in which the overlapping effects of tone, phonation type and the typologically unusual three-way vowel length distinction must be untangled through careful acoustic measurements. The results of this investigation will be important to students of language and the human mind, and will also have value to the speaker community in the development of orthographic standards, an ongoing process in the newly independent South Sudan.","The project design incorporates a range of activities that will have demonstrable social and cultural benefits for the Nuer speaking communities in South Sudan and elsewhere, including the UK diaspora. The Nuer form the second largest speech community of the new Republic of South Sudan, and education in indigenous languages has been a stated priority of the government of this new country. Development of a standard orthographic system is an essential step in the pursuit of activities involving community-led indigenous language maintenance (Lüpke 2011) such as dictionary writing (Mosel 2011) and curriculum development (Coronel-Molina and McCarty 2011). The production of resources of this kind is a precursor to increasing human capital, thereby creating pathways to the economic benefits associated with education. Opportunities for attaining literacy in Nuer are currently very scarce. This is a reflection of a lack of resources; e.g. there are no dictionaries or grammar books, only some elementary primers. The problem is compounded by the lack of consistent orthographic standardization across texts. Currently a variety of writing systems are in circulation, none of which provide more than an approximate representation of the language. In particular, the prosodic features that play so crucial a role in the inflectional system, as well as the lexicon, have only ever been partially represented in writing. Through careful linguistic analysis, our research has a clear potential to benefit the speaker community by addressing issues pertinent to resource development:  (i) Our acoustic and phonological analyses based on data collected in South Sudan and London will feed directly into recommendations for the development of orthographic standards.  (ii) The corpus of noun and verb paradigms elicited will form a solid basis for the development of a Nuer-English dictionary (and grammar).  Steps taken to feed our resources into an orthography development programme will be made through engagement with South Sudan-based community groups involved in literacy, as well as the Summer Institute of Linguistics (South Sudan branch). To facilitate the dissemination of our findings to stakeholders interested in participating in literacy development we will hold a workshop in Juba in the final year of the project. The goal of the workshop will be to facilitate and stimulate community-led work in this area. The workshop will create a network between elders, local community leaders, local linguists and teachers to provide a forum for discussion of key issues related to the development and implementation of a standardized script. We will also use this opportunity to discuss appropriate steps to provide literacy support and encourage its use among Nuer speakers. Audio and video recordings of spontaneous texts, including narratives and songs will be made available (given appropriate permissions) to the online Nuer community through a web portal established for the dissemination for our proposed research on Nuer. In addition to forming a research tool for grammatical analysis and numerous potential applied uses, these texts act as a digital linguistic and cultural resource for Nuer in the diaspora, including individuals who identify as cultural Nuer, but do not speak the language. It is our particular desire that the availability of these resources will help to reinforce community identity and prestige among the UK Nuer speaking community, which so far lacks the resources and organization found in communities in North America and Australia.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL011824%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Playing A/Part is an interdisciplinary collaboration (drama, media arts, psychology) working with autistic girls (aged 11-18) and women to investigate the female face of autism through innovative, creative and participatory approaches pioneered by members of the research team. Improvisatory performance and interactive media are used as creative tools for articulating the lived experience of the female autistic community. The project responds to calls for more research and novel methods to document the distinctive experiences and characteristics of this under-represented group. As Sarah Wild states, headteacher at Limpsfield Grange (the only UK specialist school for autistic girls and a project partner): 'We're trying to get politicians to understand that this is a group who are massively under-diagnosed, but also that there are not the right services out there for them or the awareness, including GPs who don't understand what female autism looks like.' Autistic women describe experiences of invisibility, masking their identities and ""faking it"" to be socially compliant. This results in high levels of anxiety, which impact on mental well-being, self-confidence and self-worth, leading to increased rates of depression, self-harm and eating disorders. There is, therefore, a need to support self-development and well-being in autistic females, especially during adolescence; a crucial time for identity formation during which autistic difficulties and differences can become more pronounced in the face of increasing socio-emotional pressures.  Through its interdisciplinary and participatory approach, the project will produce new knowledge about the female autistic experience that will be of value to the autism community, the creative industries, education, health and social care. This has the potential to inform the development of more female-sensitive diagnostic measures and services, highlighting the creative contribution of this community and challenging existing stereotypes. The project aims to fully engage the female autistic community in the research about them and to transform public understanding and awareness. To achieve this we will:  1. Co-create a programme of participatory arts workshops and creative toolkit, enabling autistic female adolescents to articulate their lived experiences and identities;  2. Conduct a specially designed survey amongst a) autistic women and b) autism experts to achieve consensus on commonly shared features of female autism. 3. Deliver and trial a programme of participatory arts workshops in different educational settings;  4. Evaluate the efficacy of participatory arts workshops to enhance self-perception, mental well-being and self-esteem using new and established measures;  5. Co-produce and test the feasibility of a participatory arts peer mentoring model in educational and community settings, involving autistic girls and women in collaborative and creative activities;  6. Engage the female autistic community in participatory research and dissemination;  7. Create an international interdisciplinary participatory research network  8.Disseminate research findings to stakeholders and the wider public through a programme of impact and public engagement.  The project builds on the team's previous work exploring autistic identities, perception and creativity, and on methods successfully trialled in a pilot programme of participatory arts workshops using drama and interactive media to explore how female autistic students perceived and engaged with their environments and each other. A public engagement programme includes symposia, roundtables, films, educational resources, a media installation, performances and interactive website. Through this collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, using established and novel methods, we will produce outcomes that are more than the sum of their parts, transforming the face of autism research through female autistic voices.","BENEFICIARIES As the female autism community are under-represented and under diagnosed, they are core beneficiaries for this research. Moreover, autism funding has traditionally prioritised causes and intervention rather than education and support. There is little research dedicated to improving physical and mental well-being in autism or into how schools and services can contribute. Hence the development of tools and evaluation methods for working with autistic female teenagers could be flexibly applied in a range of educational and non-academic contexts, and would benefit a range of potential user groups:  1. Autistic individuals: direct beneficiaries are 150 participants (autistic female teenagers) their families and carers; 6 steering group members, autistic HE theatre students.  2.Members of the autistic community (autistic people, families and carers) 3. Educators (direct beneficiaries are participating and networked schools); all teachers engaged in educating autistic girls/teaching assistants/educational psychologists/speech therapists; school counselling services; Local Education Authorities, schools accommodating female autistic pupils (mainstream, special, units).  4.Health and social care services: Paediatricians, GPs, clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, mental health service providers and commissioners; family therapists; local authority social care employees, police and probation services whose work brings them into contact with autistic girls and women. 5.Arts professionals and the creative industries: conservatoires and HE theatre departments; performing arts professionals working with autistic women; practitioners in applied and social theatre; arts centres associated with the project.   6. Local communities; the general public and policymakers. HOW MIGHT THEY BENEFIT? The primary beneficiaries (autistic students and steering group) are included as researchers, participants, advisors and practitioners, taking their perspectives and needs into account in planning, delivery and outcomes. They will benefit from activities designed to enhance agency, creative expression and mental well-being. For the steering group, the project affords opportunities for community networking and career development. The autistic community would benefit from increased understanding by others of how female autism is experienced potentially informing structures for education, support and employment, particularly in the creative industries. For families and carers of participants, the benefits could translate into improved interpersonal relations and family well-being. Other beneficiaries are health professionals such as GPs, clinicians involved in diagnosis and mental health practitioners as the research will increase knowledge and understanding of what female autism looks like (leading to earlier recognition) and how to support this community. This may reduce mental health problems and improve education and employment outcomes for autistic women. Education professionals will also benefit from new opportunities for training and access to the project's educational resources. The research findings on female autism in different educational settings and the impact of creative practices on well-being can inform curriculum development and pedagogy.  As the interests and capabilities of autistic females may lead them to pursue creative careers, arts professionals and educators will benefit from the project's potential to inform training and to make recommendations to improve the prospects for this population to realise their potential for a creative autistic life. The project's activities in community venues contribute to a wider community and public engagement programme with the ambition to change public perception of autism and gender so that autistic females are recognised and supported to benefit from employment, social relationships and community inclusion as keys to quality of life",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS001158%2F1

These themes are multidisciplinary and reflect research strengths across and beyond the Arts and Humanities at Kent as well as being aligned to both AHRC and UoK research priorities. The IAA has four objectives and related work packages through which we will accelerate impact across our priority themes:  1. Implementing a programme of 'quick response' funding (WP1), enabling rapid response to new opportunities 2. Developing, testing and implementing new models of social enterprise start-up and licensing (WP2) 3. Establishing multi-sector strategic partnership networks (WP3) for each theme 4.

Its advances will be of benefit to that inter- and multi-disciplinary set of academics, but also much more widely, including members of the public, arts administrators, the third-sector, educationalists and teachers, and artists. The kinds of ideology this proposal contests are not limited to the UK, so this research is international in its scope. The use of cultural audit, the promotion of entrenched hierarchies via conservative and consumerist dogma, and the assumption of commensurability via economic exchange are global phenomena.  ""Against Value in the Arts"" sounds like a counter-intuitive way to go about describing and defending the value of the arts. This project proposes, however, that it is often the staunchest defenders of art who do it the most harm, by suppressing its dissenting voice, by neutralizing its painful truths, and by instrumentalizing its potentiality, so that rather than expanding the autonomy of thought and feeling of the artist and the audience, it makes art self-satisfied, or otherwise an echo-chamber for the limited self-description of people's desires.  This project does not argue that the arts have no value; quite the opposite. It argues instead that value judgments can behave insidiously, and incorporate aesthetic, ethical or ideological values fundamentally opposed to the ""value"" they purportedly name and describe. It argues that even the most ostensibly virtuous of values can become oppressive when disseminated bureaucratically, and as a set of official renderings or statements of artistic accounts, also known as audit culture.  ""Against Value in the Arts"" argues that the greatest possible value of the arts has been, and might continue to be to oppose, rigorously and constitutively, dominant and dominating ascriptions of value.  ""Against Value"" proposes that the best way to engage critically with our society is to suspend presumptions of value, to engender instead a radical indeterminacy, to propose an incommensurability, the critique of any ""common measure"", even if that common measure pretends to be as neutral as ""value"". It seeks to antagonize questions about who gets to ascribe value, and how, and to interpret those ascriptions ideologically. ""Against Value"" will attend to the following:   - The Value of ""Value"". Is the promotion of value in and of itself a virtue? How does it become coercive? How might value in one sphere mean the degradation of value in another? How does value relate to commodification? How does value make assumptions damaging to experimentation and freedom?   - Theories of Audit. Description (always flawed, always partial) is installed as both aim and outcome by cultural auditing. Audit therefore alters the object it seeks to study. Auditing began in economics, but has since been taken up in management, and across the public sector, in part because it can be used to pursue political ends by those in power. How can we refuse to adhere to always partial ""self-description"", as curtailed by the categories and presumed outcomes of the audit, on behalf of an open-ended, indeterminate, and patient record? How does auditing reflect on contemporary issues such as privacy?   - Theories of Exchange: Society is dominated by the exchange values, in particular, the belief that everything can be exchanged via the medium of money.   - Dissent, Democracy, Liberality, Emancipation, Trust, Care, Privacy. The project will conclude with reflections on alternative values, and the ways in which value, audit, and exchange may impact damagingly upon them.","Research from the ""Against Value"" project involves thirteen academics and artists from a diverse range of disciplines and artforms, including the history of art, anthropology, literature, languages, political science, music, philosophy, theatre, poetry and cultural studies. Its advances will be of benefit to that inter- and multi-disciplinary set of academics, but also much more widely, including members of the public, arts administrators, the third-sector, educationalists and teachers, and artists. The kinds of ideology this proposal contests are not limited to the UK, so this research is also international in its scope. The use of cultural audit, the promotion of intrenched hierarchies via conservative and consumerist dogma, and the assumption of commensurability via economic exchange are global phenomena.  We will publicize the outputs of the project, and its dialogue, in opinion-pieces in journals such as the LRB, the TES and TLS, as well as the broadsheet press. We understand the project speaks to a sympathetic audience, and to maximize its dissemination will take up every opportunity to extend its debate into the public sphere. Its potential controversy will afford it attention from journalists and other cultural bodies, including art and culture programming on television and radio.  This research will impact the following:   - Policy. ""Against Value"" is aimed, ultimately, at changing policy on a number of fronts, or rather to provide the theoretical background so that new policies can develop in the future. It will provide critical arguments which can be used to confront mistaken policies across arts administration and higher education. Though clearly work infused with a critical spirit it hopes to be energizing and productive for artists, arts adminsistrators, funders, and academics by providing a defense of their work that is not reliant on contemporary trends in audit, and by demonstrating a keen intellectual solidarity with those currently struggling against various kinds of social damage.   - Arts and education administration. ""Against Value"" will help shape the next round of funding calls in the AHRC's Cultural Value Project, allowing for greater critical and dissenting voice. It understands that the disagreement with those who seek to reduce the funding of the arts, whether in terms of public or private money, cannot, in the end, be swayed by pragmatic economic considerations, that if the arts and education communities choose to defend themselves on economic grounds they will fail, because economic arguments can too readily be used for ideological ends. We must recognise the divisive and hierarchical policies of the past number of years for what they are, and respond by changing the terms of the debate.   - Artists. ""Against Value"" will benefit artists across disciplines by making apparent the dangers of self-auditing, the replacement of intellectual autonomy with a bureaucratized view of their own research and purpose.   - Public. It will speak to members of the public sympathetic to many of its tasks, for example those contesting the dominance of audit in their lines of work, or those contesting the use of those audits to ideological ends, or those sympathetic to the struggle against the domination of social life by economic dogma, and those who wield economic dogma for socially regressive aims.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL006022%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Exploring how communities respond to economic and climatic crisis is key for enhancing understanding of resilience in the past and present. This project will explore responses to a deteriorating climate and trade collapse at the end of the Bronze Age in Britain. A major focus is the new social and economic networks that developed and how these made communities resilient in the face of turmoil. This will be achieved by employing a new suite of scientific methods to analyse the very rich, but understudied sites known as middens. Around 800BC Europe suffered great upheaval as the climate deteriorated and economies collapsed, with bronze abruptly losing value. Like the 21st century economic crisis, this first millennium BC boom and bust caused great instability. In southern Britain, society did not shift focus to iron, but rather to agricultural intensification and grand-scale feasting; there was a 'Feasting Age' prior to the Iron Age. The remains of these feasts created some of the most startling archaeological sites ever unearthed. These 'middens' represent the very richest resource of material from British prehistory, some covering an area the size of several football pitches and producing hundreds of thousands of artefacts. These provide the key to understanding socio-economic change during this phase. In spite of the rich archaeological resource and the importance of this transition in shaping society for centuries, we still know remarkably little. The most fundamental change was the breakdown in the bronze trade network, which had controlled the movement of people, ideas and artefacts for centuries. We know very little about the new social and economic networks that emerged and centred on these vast feasts, making society resilient at a time of instability and framing power relations and community interaction right up to the Roman conquest. They are key to understanding not only this transitional phase, but British later prehistory more broadly. New research developments mean that the time is right to address these archaeological problems. Recent excavations have provided a wealth of material to address these issues. In addition, scientific advances mean that we can now establish patterns of human and animal movement with greater precision than was previously possible. Finally, there is a large body of material and a suite of scientific methods that can reconstruct the changing face of society in southern Britain and examine how it remained resilient in the face of economic and climatic deterioration. The project will focus on six middens that date to the Bronze Age-Iron Age transition (c. 800BC-400BC) in two regions: Wiltshire and the Thames Valley. These areas were the epicentres of activity during this phase, hosting vast feasting events evidenced by rich material assemblages. These feasts were at the very centre of the dynamics of a changing society. They provide a focal point for community interaction, forging and consolidating new alliances. They are also the focus of new economic practices, representing hubs for the intensification and trade of agricultural produce. Therefore, using a suite of bioarchaeological techniques, the project will examine the new social and economic networks that developed and, using theoretical models, will examine how they made communities resilient in the face of adversity. Multi-isotope analysis (strontium, sulphur, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) will reveal where animals and humans came from and how agricultural production was maximised through different husbandry practices and landscape use. This will reconstruct the new inter-community networks and the organisation of the economy and agricultural production, thus revealing the strategies that made communities resilient. It will provide a key case study into responses to socio-economic collapse and will transform understanding of how change at the end of the Bronze Age shaped society in southern Britain for centuries.","The impact programme will enrich lives and transform perceptions and has three strands, varying in the number of beneficiaries and the potential scale of impact. Military veterans: Ex-forces personnel will benefit from rehabilitation, skill development and employability through post-excavation analysis on material from East Chisenbury. The site is a visible mound on the MoD Salisbury Plain training area, well known to thousands of soldiers. Operation Nightingale (ON, run by CA Archaeologist of the Year 2019 R Osgood) and Breaking Ground Heritage (BGH, run by ex-Marine R Bennett) have run 5 seasons of excavation (2011-3, 2016-7) with veterans. The PI excavated/supervised bone processing in 2016-7. ON and BGH enable recovery pathways and skill development for ex-forces personnel through heritage work. They won the English Heritage award for best community action project (2016) and addressed the House of Lords All Party Group on heritage and wellbeing (2019). Veterans have progressed to archaeology degrees, to heritage employment or to use their new skills in other sectors. Veterans are strongly invested in the project and have expressed disappointment at not being involved in post-excavation, when more skills are developed and the site narrative is created. This will be addressed by engaging them in processing and scientific analysis of the material they excavated. The co-produced data will be key to the project outcomes. Successful co-production has been pioneered at Cardiff through the AHRC-funded CAER project (Times Higher Education 2017 award winner), on which the PI is the zooarchaeologist. It has been highly successful in benefiting communities and archaeological research, particularly with support from the AHRC Digital Transformations in Community Research Co-Production programme. This has invariably involved communities defined by location. This project will be pioneering in co-producing research from excavation to laboratory with a community of military veterans. BGH and Cardiff University BioArchaeology will sign a memorandum of understanding to train veterans for other ON projects (4-8 veterans per year), thus creating legacy benefits. Military communities and the regional populace: Perceptions of prehistoric Wiltshire will be transformed among these groups through 9 engagement events across garrison town schools, community centres, young archaeologists' clubs and the Wiltshire Heritage Museum. The budget will not facilitate events in the Thames Valley, but funds will be sought to support this (e.g. Cardiff's Impact Fund). The programme will demonstrate the wide catchment Wiltshire has had for millennia, just as today (c. 20,000 military personnel and dependants). It will counter the misconception that Wiltshire is a county for 'local' people and inspire a sense of belonging for military families and pride in Wiltshire's diversity for the regional populace. It will also redress the great imbalance in how Wiltshire's prehistory is portrayed and perceived. Museums, popular books and the media have long provided a biased view, skewed towards eye-catching monuments and artefacts, from Neolithic henges to Early Bronze Age gold. Middens of the BA-IA transition are absent from the public consciousness, yet it was arguably when the region's importance was at its height. Most local people know nothing of these sites due to a lack of popular exposure. Wider public: A tailored media strategy will engage wider audiences to maximise national impact and give this little-known phase the exposure it deserves. Middens and the vast feasts they hosted are overlooked in the narrative of Britain's past. This will be addressed through popular dissemination. Press releases will accompany the project's synthetic papers, articles will be submitted to popular magazines and a programme on prehistoric feasting will be pitched to Radio 4. This multi-pronged approach will help change public perceptions of prehistoric Britain.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT006528%2F1

The rewritten judgments will help to illuminate the conceptual and practical challenges of securing children's rights within judicial decision-making and will explore how developments in theory and practice can inform and (re)invigorate the legal protection of children's rights. Each judgment will be accompanied by a commentary explaining the historical and legal context of the original case and the rationale underpinning the revised judgment including: the particular children's rights perspective adopted; the extent to which it addresses the children's rights deficiencies evident in the original judgment; and the potential impact the alternative version might have had on law, policy or practice. This very modern, applied approach to legal scholarship is inspired by similar highly successful projects, such as the Feminist Judgments Project (2010). The Children's Rights Judgments Project is unique in that it illustrates precisely how children's rights can be integrated into judicial reasoning across a range of legal areas including health, administrative, education, immigration, family, child protection and criminal justice. Moreover, it explores this in a number of jurisdictional contexts, looking at how children's rights can inform deliberations in different national courts across the world, as well as in the international courts (the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, and the International Criminal Court).  Leading children's rights academics will work alongside early career researchers to produce the judgments and commentaries. Judgment writing is a challenging and skillful process, demanding a balanced consideration not just of the rights and interests of children, but of other parties implicated in a particular case. Thus, the network will draw on the experience and guidance of two judges, and early drafts of the judgments will also be subjected to the scrutiny of other legal practitioners, representatives from the NGO sector and children and young people with a view to testing their feasibility and comprehensiveness. Other interested parties who are not participating in the network can follow progress on a dedicated Children's Rights Judgments website, which will include a reading list of seminal children's rights literature and good practice examples of existing children's rights judgments.  The judgments and commentaries will be published as an edited collection which will be launched at the annual Socio-Legal Studies Association Conference in April 2017.","Demonstrating how children's rights norms and theories can inform judicial decision-making is the key rationale underpinning this network and is central to generating impact. In addition to the academic beneficiaries referred to in the previous section, non-academic beneficiaries will include judges, lawyers and children's rights campaign NGOs operating at domestic, European and International level. Ultimately, the outputs from the project will impact upon children and young people also.  The network will impact on the beneficiaries in four main ways.  First, the process of judgment writing will fill an important gap between academic and applied law. It will illustrate to those charged with applying and interpreting the law how the intelligence we have gained about children's lives, perspectives and rights, generated through a rich body of research, can be brought to bear more effectively on judicial reasoning.  Second, the network will add a new dimension to the emergent legal method of judgment writing, demonstrating its application in an entirely new theoretical and normative framework.    Third, the interactive format of the workshops supporting the network lends itself to a high degree of exchange between the various participants, and a distinctly collegial approach to the judgment writing. This will help to nurture strong collaborative links between children's rights scholars and practitioners at various points in their career, and stimulate open dialogue with non-academic stakeholders working in children's rights litigation and campaigning. It will simultaneously demystify the academic process as well as the judicial adjudicative process, whilst also exposing some of the stark challenges associated with balancing competing interests of the various parties implicated in cases.  Finally, it is hoped that the production of revised judgments and explanatory commentaries that respond more explicitly to children's rights will demonstrate to the judiciary the possibilities inherent in a child-rights-based approach, inspire more creative, strategic litigation among practitioners and campaigners, and generate longer-term, positive effects for the protection of children's rights.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM009033%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This follow-on project will provide additional impact by distilling and disseminating knowledge acquired during the AHRC-funded ""French Theatre of the Napoleonic Era"" project.  In the original bid, we envisaged small-scale participatory research workshops with theatre practitioners to explore practical issues surrounding the relationship between text and music in theatre of the time. By rehearsing scenes from melodrama we have shown that apparently simple musical cues operated on multiple levels -alluding to places or people; establishing atmosphere; marking moments of emotional release and coordinating the movement of actors. Follow-on funding would allow us to explore this much further and enable us to work more innovatively with 2 non-HEIs to put on public performances of plays not performed anywhere for nearly 200 years. Georgian Theatre Royal, Richmond The Georgian Theatre Royal is the country's most complete Georgian playhouse, in regular use between 1788 and 1830. We have been asked us collaborate on a public performance of a Pixerécourt play (in new translation) with contemporary Napoleonic music. We will run workshops with the youth theatre, local amateur dramatics groups and schools in conjunction with the Theatre's artistic director and 2-3 professional actors, leading to a 'performance in a day'. In addition to the broader positive cultural impact of restaging this play, our work with local actors will enhance their knowledge and skills base by training them in French acting techniques of the period and opening their sensibilities to the relationship between music and text. The Theatre does not currently have the funds to invest in interpretation and so our work with them will provide valuable recordings to be used in their exhibition space and in subsequent outreach activities. Portchester Castle The collaboration with English Heritage at Portchester will allow us to explore the plays performed by Napoleonic prisoners of war, which included an ambitious selection of hits from the Paris stage but also their own plays, including a full-scale melodrama, Roseliska, written in 1810 by a 21-year old sergeant, Jean Baptiste Louis de Lafontaine, who had been an actor at the Théâtre des Troubadours in Paris. The play draws heavily on the Parisian tradition of grand spectacle whilst addressing a number of themes close to the prisoners' hearts.  Conducting performance-based research is particularly fruitful when surroundings can be properly taken into consideration. Although the wooden staging has not survived, the dimensions and acoustics of the basement of the Keep at Portchester are as they were in 1809/10 and working with actors and musicians alongside EH archaeologists allows us unique access into the mechanics of prisoner-of-war theatricals. Roseliska for instance has a scene where the hero escapes out of a window - working in situ will allow us to explore the possibility that the prisoners used the architecture of the keep to their advantage rather than constructing a set for this scene... Performing and recording the prisoners' own play will bring the Keep to life for visitors and allow them to discover more about the ingenuity and creativity of those detained. The performances will bring other benefits to Portchester, including increased visibility as an English Heritage property, potentially an increase in visitor numbers and income and will allow the Castle to expand the topics covered in its schools work. To coincide with the public performances at Portchester and in Richmond, we will run workshops for local schools on performing melodrama and the relationship between text and music. In this, we will be able to draw on our experience from running similar events in Oxford and Coventry in 2014. Staging Napoleonic theatre will allow us to reach new audiences, significantly enhance the value and wider benefits of the original project and create a firm basis for further collaboration with our non HEI partners.","Who will benefit from this research? In the first instance, English Heritage and the Georgian Theatre Royal will be the two principal beneficiaries of the research. In the second instance, the wider public will also benefit, particularly those attending performances and visiting either of the two sites to look at exhibition material. Thirdly, those involved in the 'performance in a day' at Richmond will develop skills in 19th-century acting. Fourthly, school pupils who attend the planned sessions in both locations will be encouraged to develop their intellectual curiosity and an understanding of others and their history. Provisional conversations with amateur theatre groups in France indicates that there is the possibility of beneficiaries in France since well as the setting of the manuscript musical scores would make the plays accessible for anyone to perform. How will they benefit from this research? English Heritage will benefit from the research as they look to reinterpret the Keep at Portchester Castle as part of their renewal of displays and exhibits at the site. There are two elements to the benefits: i) an improved exhibition space informed by the most recent research into the theatricals of the prisoners of war and ii) increased and new interest in the castle through the performance of one of the plays written by French prisoners of war while at the Castle in 1809. The research has the potential to make a significant difference to the profile of Portchester Castle and its visitor numbers. Benefits to the Georgian Theatre Royal can similarly be split between benefits to the Theatre and to the participants of the 'performance in a day'. The Theatre will benefit from an extension to its educational activities and visitors will be offered an enhanced understanding of the melodramatic tradition of which British theatre was part in the early 19th century as videos of performance will be available in the theatre's exhibition space. Recorded extracts of the performance of the Danube Fortress can also be used in its work with local schools. Members of their youth theatre will gain unrivalled experience in making an artistic tradition visible once more through the workshops that we will be running. They, and other local actors, will gain expertise in melodrama, a now lapsed theatrical form that requires actors to externalise emotion, switch from comic to tragic mode of expression, sing, dance, and hold tableaux. Being confronted by unfamiliar acting techniques will enable them to re-evaluate their usual working practices.  The research will enhance the UK's cultural enrichment, by giving audiences access to a theatrical form that dominated worldwide at the start of the 19th century - melodrama - but which has no continuous performance tradition. It will increase public awareness of this forgotten theatrical form and also of the situation of French prisoners of war during the Napoleonic conflicts. Many of the benefits of the research will be realised quickly because the follow-on funding is to facilitate performances but there will also be longer-term cultural and socio-economic benefits because recordings of performances will allow subsequent visitors access to the performance material.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP00394X%2F1

Landscape also offers ways to draw greater social, economic and environmental benefits from heritage. We will uncover the natural connections that exist between the domains of landscape and heritage, both in research and policy terms. In the face of significant environmental and social change, seeing heritage through the lenses of landscape allows heritage to act as a solution not a problem. CHeriScape will work in the interlocking spaces between the two Council of Europe conventions - the European Landscape Convention and the Faro Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage to Society - to demonstrate how they align and support each other. A third aspect of our thinking will be based on the ESF/COST Science Policy Briefing 'Landscapes in a Changing World'. Our method is to arrange five large conferences, to which we will invite keynote speakers and also policy makers and stakeholders, and to produce from them a suite of products aimed at strengthening the influence that landscape and heritage can have on both high-level and local environmental and social policy. To do this we have brought together a small but highly experienced and expert consortium, with a range of disciplines including some not normally associated with heritage (because landscape is one of the most interdisciplinary of fields of study). We are also acutely aware that landscape falls simultaneously into all three categories of heritage defined by the JPI; it is at one and the same time tangible and intangible, and increasingly it is being experienced by many people through digital means. CHeriScape will therefore also use this rich concept of 'landscape' as a laboratory to closely examine the nature and potential of 'heritage'.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL503976%2F1

It focuses on tracing the growth and development of new towns from the garden city movement to the 'model' new town of Milton Keynes, through a programme of co-designed research activities and events. From E.M Forster's home in Stevenage to the uncatalogued papers of Milton Keynes Development Corporation, the project seeks to uncover hidden stories and sources with community researchers and then publicise the research findings through a range of channels for the benefit of a broad audience. As reflected in the costs, the project will result in a series of outputs including a New Town Heritage Festival, conference papers and publications, research workshops and events and a co-produced New Town Heritage book.","The beneficiaries of this project are: 1. Project team 2. Community Partners: Luton/MK/Stevenage/Knebworth 3. Local Heritage Organisations, particularly in Garden Cities and New Towns 4. General public: particularly in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire 5. NCCPE and Policy Makers: particularly in the field of community engagement and urban design What impact will this project have and how will these groups benefit from this research? Public Engagement: Public engagement is central to the Connected Communities programme and the New Towns Heritage project. Through the charrette mathodology and established project partnership this will begin from the start of the project. The public's participation in the project, through the events and research activity programme will give people an active role in generating new research material. In the process, the participating public will be enhancing their own knowledge of their cultural heritage as well as contributing to that of the wider public. Public access: New Town Heritage remains an under-appreciated topic and is in many cases still a 'hidden history.' One of the benefits of this project is in bringing new town stories to light, through access to uncatalogued collections and new or little seen sources. Public access will operate on a deeper level through enabling local people to particpate in the co-design and co-creation of research, particularly through the charrette methodology and programme of events. Project outputs will place emphasis on breadth of reach: this will include an interdisciplinary New Town Heritage Festival (rather than a traditional conference) and an accessible publication featuring research material from academics and community partners alongside other forms of dissemination such as photographs or primary sources. Economic: The project will generate public interest in new town heritage, and serve to promote the collections of national and local organisations, and in doing so increase footfall as well as wider appreciation of modern new town environments, such as Stevanage and Milton Keynes. Develop national and international networks: The project will enhance links and co-operation between the community partners - for example, Stevenage Borough Council and Knebworth House, Milton Keynes Borough Council and Luton Culture. Likewise, organisations and community researchers with an interest in new town heritage will be able to meet and share reserach findings, between themselves and with academic partners. It is expected that the project findings will provide national and international comparisons, providing a foundation for future research.   Knowledge transfer, training and skills: The project team will gain further skills in working with community partners on interdisciplinary activities and new sources. There will be a two-way exchange of skills and knowledge between the project team and community researchers, experts in their own heritage, which should lead to uncovering of new material. Community partners will also gain the opportunity to work on a broad-based creative project with other organisations, while individuals will gain the opportunity to undertake training - for example in oral history interviewing, exhibition curation or historical research.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007947%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              In languages like English, the form of a verb is dependent on the properties of the subject. For instance, we say 'My brother laughs at these photographs' but 'My brothers laugh at these photographs'. The mechanism which provides the correct form of the verb is called agreement: in these sentences the verb agrees with the subject, and the difference in the form of the verb ('laughs' vs. 'laugh') is determined by the fact that the subject in one sentence is third person singular ('My brother') whereas in the other it is third person plural ('My brothers'). The agreement between a verb and its arguments is a familiar and cross-linguistically frequent phenomenon, considered by many linguists, of different theoretical persuasions, to be at the core of language.  Another type of agreement familiar from English, is the agreement between a noun and its modifier: in the examples above 'these' agrees with 'photographs' in plural number (compare the singular alternative 'this photograph'). Since the controller of the agreement, 'photographs' is plural in both sentences, it is not surprising that the form of the demonstrative also plural.  While verbs, adjectives, and demonstratives agree in many languages, a situation in which a preposition (such as 'at' in the examples above) would change in any way is rather unusual. Still, there are languages, such as Welsh and Breton, where the form of a preposition changes depending on the grammatical properties of the noun it introduces. A situation where the form of a preposition would change depending on the properties of the subject, as verbs do in English, and not with the noun it introduces as in Welsh, is so rare that it until now has escaped linguistic analysis altogether. To give an illustration: if in the example sentences above the preposition 'at' had to appear in two forms: one in accordance with the singular number of the subject 'my brother' and another in accordance with the plural number, 'my brothers', we would consider this to be a very unusual agreement pattern. This type of agreement does not respect the existing syntactic grouping in a sentence but connects elements which belong to different syntactic phrases (such as 'my brother' and 'at'). We call this pattern ""external agreement"". External agreement challenges existing syntactic models: all current approaches define agreement as a local syntactic relation, i.e. occurring within clear syntactic domain such as verb phrase, noun phrase, prepositional phrase, etc.  External agreement, being extremely rare typologically, appears with fascinating regularity in languages of the Nakh-Daghestanian family spoken in the Caucasus: there are 17 languages with diachronically unrelated instances of external agreement. Such an abundance of examples appearing in languages with considerable variation in their syntactic systems makes external agreement in Nakh-Daghestanian an ideal opportunity for research into morphosyntactic, semantic and pragmatic mechanisms which regulate not only agreement, a fundamental part of a grammar of many languages, but also the less obvious relationships between syntactic elements in a sentence.  Our previous work on agreement gives us the theoretical apparatus necessary for accounting for this challenging phenomenon. Our typological work makes us aware of the range of morphological and syntactic possibilities in agreement systems. Finally, our expertise in Nakh-Daghestanian languages in general enables us to go straight into the intricacies of external agreement patterns. Our project will (i) investigate the phenomenon of external agreement from a theoretical perspective; (ii) collect new data from little studied and/or endangered languages; (iii) compile a database and make it fully available for public online use; and (iv) publish a book and articles on the significance of our findings for current theories of grammar.","The core activities carried out for this research constitute theoretical work which has its major impact within syntactic and morphological theory and Caucasian studies. While linguistic research of this kind makes a long-term contribution to a knowledge base that influences developments in social and commercial applications, we have identified two key communities beyond our narrow academic environment where impact will be more immediate. The two impact-beneficiary groups can be identified as: (i) The native speaker communities of two small endangered/underdescribed languages of Daghestan: Andi (5,800 speakers) and Rutul (around 30,000 speakers).  Although a grammatical description of Andi exists, (Tsertsvadze, 1961, in Georgian), there is no grammar of Rutul, and there is no culturally significant language material for these two largely unwritten languages (no published texts or online recordings and the materials available to speakers are extremely limited).  Recent migration to big cities has had a devastating impact on linguistic and cultural diversity in Daghestan. The low social status of minority languages has caused language transmission to children to decline. Many small Daghestanian languages are not officially recognised, and people perceive them as 'dialects' with low prestige. However, our experience of working with the endangered Archi language spoken in the highlands of Daghestan proved that interest on the international level can change the attitude of the speakers considerably: after 12 years of our work, the presence of Archi in both official and social media rose dramatically: several websites created for the Archi village use our materials. Hard copies of the Archi dictionary (Chumakina et al, 2007), printed specifically for the community, have been warmly welcomed by Archi people, especially those who now live outside the Archi village. Archi language and culture has become more visible in the Daghestanian context and people now are less reluctant to claim their identity as Archi.  The data from Andi and Rutul, the focus languages of this project, will constitute a significant part of the database on external agreement, and we will publish the source data (annotated audio and video materials) online. The potential impact will therefore be a natural result of our academic activities: we will demonstrate to the speakers how highly we value their language, which will help to increase their willingness to pass the languages to younger generations. In addition to this, we will publish a booklet for each language with parallel texts: (a) a myth-like story on the origin of the people, (b) a recipe of a characteristic local food and (c) a collection of folk songs and poems. The materials will be published in a Cyrillic based orthography with Russian translations and colour photographs taken on site. This will demonstrate to the speakers that their languages, however small, are highly valuable on the international level. We will also make these booklets available online.  (ii) Members of the public who have an active interest in languages and/or socio-cultural diversity in general, particularly in issues surrounding language endangerment.  Our work will enhance the general knowledge and appreciation of endangered languages and cultures, bring largely unknown linguistic and cultural traditions to greater public attention, and provide better understanding of the factors that threaten and sustain languages. This will be achieved in part through our participation in large scale public outreach activities organised by the University of Surrey. These popular events - aimed at the general public - are widely publicised and have been well attended by the local community; at the recent Festival of Wonder in Guildford, demand for tickets outstripped the 9000 places available.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR005540%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              We propose a research network to investigate three related yet distinct fields of: contemporary theatre, artificial intelligence and ludic technologies. The main focus of the network will be to investigate these fields from the perspective of humanist discourses and artistic practice. We feel that this perspective has often been omitted in the current discussions and academic discourses on A.I. and thus it would be a timely consideration. We also feel that in our current post-digital age, there is scope, novelty and timeliness in an interdisciplinary research approach to these three fields, in particular when considering how contemporary artistic practices can question our relationship with newly emerging technologies.  The focus and the originality of this network lies in the exploration of the way that these three disciplines intertwine and an exploration of A.I. through humanist and artistic practice perspectives. With the ever-increasing investments and developments in this area there is a strong case for an investigation of its cultural impact. Through this focus there is a potential to enable the development of a coherent theoretical framework through which the bringing together of theatre, A.I. and ludic technologies can be conceptualised. We also feel that many geographical areas such as mid-Wales have been underrepresented in the discussions surrounding A.I. in favour of a more globalised domain. Hence the network will enable the activation of more local discourses on these topics.   The network will bring together academics from the field of A.I. research, computer studies, game studies, arts and humanities, theatre and performance artists/practitioners with the aim of exploring the above research agenda. This will be achieved through three events (three symposia/workshops) running over the course of two years. Each symposium will consist of small conference-like proceedings where participants will share research papers and discuss their findings. Each proceeding will be followed by a workshop event led by an invited artist/practitioner/designer.","In this section we will briefly outline how the impact of this project will be achieved for three different stakeholder groups. For each group we will consider impact in terms of both short-term and long-term objectives.  The first group of stakeholders will consist of practitioners in the field of contemporary theatre and performance, A.I. design and videogames design. The short-term impact will be achieved as follows. The research network will enable this group to discuss new ideas and directions for their practice in the context of theoretical framings and knowledge transfer espoused by the project. This will be achieved through three symposia. Each symposium will last for a day and will consist of two stages: a keynote and a presentation of papers by members of the group followed by discussions. The second stage will consist of performance events, conceptual discussions and workshops delivered by the invited practitioners. There will be long-term impact in building new relationships between practitioners and academic researchers, leading to potential future collaborations. This will be achieved through collaborations on the edited volume and future publications, a joint exhibition project of conceptual work generated by the network, future symposia and grant applications. We identify the second group of stakeholders as potential external collaborators such as the Digital Catapult Innovation centre, National Theatre Wales and S4C. We will approach members of these organisations and invite them to participate in the network's activities in order to establish relationships and links that will be mutually beneficial. The short-term impact on this group will be achieved as follows. Digital Catapult would benefit from new critical perspectives and discussions of future directions in which A.I. will be implemented in artistic practice. NTW would benefit from insights into how A.I. and 'ludic technologies' can be implemented in contemporary performance and theatre practice. These insights would benefit and inform the programming agenda and strategy of NTW. In a similar vein this research network would also benefit S4C in terms of programming and future project involvement. The long-term impact will be achieved by forging links between academia, media industry and businesses which will lead to potential future collaborations on interdisciplinary projects. The third group of stakeholders are the non-academic audiences. The short-term impact will be achieved as follows. Non-academic participants will have the opportunity to engage and participate in the organised workshops. There will be opportunities to spectate and also to explore new technologies and experience. External collaborators such as NTW and S4C have an extensive experience in organising and curating public-facing events and their involvement will contribute towards extending the social reach of the network. We can collaborate with their marketing teams in order to identify and target audiences who would be interested in the topics of the network. The long-term impact will be achieved as follows. The network will host an interactive website that will disseminate information about the project and hold video documentation of the events. Also, as a final event, we will organise a gallery exhibition of ideas and concepts generated by the network and produce a catalogue which will document this work (printed and online form).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV001655%2F1

Thornton was the daughter of a former Lord Deputy of Ireland and she married a member of the lesser gentry in North Yorkshire. Three of the manuscript books were edited in 1875, for the Surtees Society (dedicated to the history of north east England), and have been read widely for their insight into life in seventeenth-century England with its civil war, plague and high infant mortality rate. However, while Thornton's manuscripts retrace the events of her life multiple times, the 1875 edition created a single narrative from the three original volumes by placing the entries in chronological order. In so doing Thornton's original arrangement of her life story was obscured and some significant material was omitted. The whereabouts of the manuscripts was unknown for many decades. In 2009 two of the texts, the first and third books of her life, were acquired by the British Library but the second volume remained untraced. In 2019 it was traced to Durham Cathedral Library by Cordelia Beattie, who had also recently located a smaller 'Book of Remembrances,' also in Thornton's hand, in a chest in a terraced house in Shropshire.  Now that all the original manuscripts have been located, we are finally able to 'unedit' the Victorian edition and to ask both how this alters critical understanding of Thornton's life and texts in particular and what implications this has for the broader fields of early modern history and life-writing. While by no means the only woman to write her life in early modern England, Thornton's books offer an extraordinarily rich example of how a woman below the ranks of the nobility did so. The fact that she produced more than one version of it makes her even more exceptional. Although it has long been established that many male diarists (such as Pepys) curated their texts, such evidence does not appear to survive for early modern women writers. This project will edit all four books and make them freely available on the web in a Digital Scholarly Edition (DSE) so as to reach the widest possible audience; the importance of this form of access has been highlighted at a time in which travel and library access has been curtailed by a global pandemic. The digital aspect of this project means that, as well as making each text available in its entirety, searches for key people, places and events are enabled, which will make it useful to those interested in an array of historical issues ranging from healthcare to the British civil wars. The encoding means that we will be able to show how the content changes between the different manuscript books and how Thornton drew on other sources, especially the Bible, to write about her life. Collectively, these factors will enable us to better appreciate Thornton as an early modern writer. The DSE will also contribute to existing debates on editorial methods within the Digital Humanities and allow future scholars to develop alternative approaches to our dataset.   The topics at issue are still of keen interest today and we aim to prompt critical reflection on present-day ideas of gender, religion, science and place and their relationship with the distant past through a series of public lectures at Durham Cathedral, talks to local history groups and blog posts on our website. For example, the writings of Alice Thornton, mother-in-law of a former Dean of the Cathedral, can encourage reflection on the longer history of women's role in the Church of England. Our project partner, Durham Cathedral, has also offered to host an exhibition of Thornton related manuscripts and a one-woman play in which Thornton's words are brought to life for a modern audience. In sum, the project seeks to rescue Alice Thornton from the nineteenth-century prism through which she has long been viewed and re-present her for a twenty-first century audience.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV012738%2F1

The identity of the translators remains uncertain, but the scale and scholarly nature of the project suggest the involvement of many academic translators, probably based in Oxford. Though learned and accurate, the translation was condemned and banned within twenty five years of its appearance. The legislation promulgated early in the 15th century by the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Arundel prohibited the making of new versions and the use of any recent translations without episcopal approval of both the text and owner. In spite of this, WB became the most widely disseminated medieval English work: it survives in 250 complete or partial copies. It is also the most widely evidenced of European translations of the Vulgate. The discovery of new manuscripts and recent research on the text of the translation have rendered obsolete the only complete edition of WB published in 1850 by J. Forshall and F. Madden. A new edition is unquestionably needed, but it is at present a remote goal, not only because of the amount of work it would involve, but also because it remains unclear which principles should underlie such an edition. There is no consensus among scholars as to which manuscripts should be collated and used as the base text for different parts of the translation, or how glosses that appear in the margins of many manuscripts relate to the biblical text and should be presented in an edition; the relevance of other apparatus attached to individual manuscripts in forms clearly related to WB is also not agreed upon. The proposed inquiry aims to establish whether what are currently known as the Earlier and Later versions of the translation (believed to reflect the translators' first efforts to produce an English text and its subsequent revision) represent each a single text or a series of different redactions. It also aims to investigate the relationships between important manuscripts and their value as evidence for different parts of the text. In addition the proposed research seeks to understand better the methods of the translators' work through the study of differences between versions of the translation, particularly in vocabulary, and the study of apparatus found in manuscripts, particularly marginal glosses. The project will also explore possible ways of editing WB and how such a large body of evidence can be presented and made intelligible to a user. It will develop a methodology for editing WB and produce trial editions of two Old Testament (Proverbs and the Song of Songs) and two New Testament (the Epistles to the Romans and Hebrews) books for print and online presentation. The online edition will offer a framework for expansion when editions of other biblical books are created in future or when further materials, such as additional images or records of variants, are developed to supplement the trial editions.","Libraries The project's research outcomes will include descriptions and analysis of manuscripts, as well as images, editions and records of manuscript readings published in print and online. Availability of such materials will benefit collection description and management, and conservation work in the libraries that hold the manuscripts. The provision of such materials is an essential part of the libraries' efforts to give access to their collections to scholars, students and wider public, but the libraries usually lack the resources to carry out this work themselves, and increasingly rely on contributions from the academic community. Religious communities, media, wider public Though primarily aimed at researchers and graduate students the publications describing the project's findings and the project's editions will be of interest to members of religious communities and public interested in the history of Christianity, Reformation, biblical translation and the development of the English language and literacy in English. The interest in the Bible and its cultural and political impact throughout the world is consistently high, as can be seen from the number of print and online publications, novels, films and television programs concerned with the subject, aimed at widely different audiences. Both investigators have been invited to speak about WB and medieval tradition of biblical translation to groups interested in history, literature and theology, and to professional translators.  The proposed freely available online edition will address a need for an easily accessible, scholarly and user-friendly edition of WB. Such edition does not exist at present, and the only available options are difficult to access and use the Victorian edition and its partial reprints in modernised orthography with minimal commentary and apparatus. In order to make the project's work and the online edition better known, the investigators and PDRA will record lectures aimed at the general public to be distributed via Oxford's iTunes-u. The lectures will be dedicated to the history of the Wycliffite movement, medieval biblical translation and WB, as well as specifically to the proposed project, its context, methods and findings, and draw attention to the website and suggest possible uses of the online edition. We will also organise a series of six public lectures on the history of biblical translation in the Middle Ages and early Modern period to be hosted by the Centre for the Study of the Book at the Bodleian Library. The lectures will be given by the members of the project and invited speakers and will be accompanied by an exhibition on the history of biblical translation in English in the Middle Ages. Continuing Education Continuing Education is good value and is open to all. The results of research will be disseminated through Continuing Education teaching in Oxford and Cambridge, raising awareness of medieval biblical translation as one of the most important aspects of our cultural heritage, and creating cultural and social benefits for wider public. Investigators and PDRA will organise a study day at the Department of Continuing Education, Oxford University, and a weekend course at the Institute of Continuing Education, Cambridge University, both focusing on medieval vernacular translations of the Bible.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN001591%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will consider changing attitudes to body image and the consequent changing uses of procedures which have traditionally been regarded as 'medical'; for instance, according to BAAPS, 43,172 surgical procedures were carried out in 2012, and the most popular are concerned overtly with appearance and beauty (the most popular procedures in the UK are breast augmentation, eyelid surgery and face/neck lifts). Moreover, surveys suggest that if money was not an issue far more women would undergo such procedures, which are seen as increasingly 'normal', 'routine' and part of the 'beauty regimes' of 'ordinary women'. This project will consider the beauty norms which underlie this trend from cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral perspectives. The assumption of the network is that beauty image is becoming ever more demanding and defining of women, and increasingly men, irrespective of their professions. The project will ask whether this is the case, and how this norm is constituted and how it impacts upon women. It will also ask whether the dominant beauty norm is increasingly a global beauty norm, and thus open to less cultural and sub-cultural resistance. The project is especially concerned with role of technology in this. In particular, that procedures which were once regarded as 'exceptional' such as the use of surgery, are now regarded as 'normal' or even 'required' in certain contexts. Other increasingly demanding beauty requirements include hair removal and 'non-invasive' procedures to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. All of these procedures, whether 'routine' or 'exceptional', require time and effort to maintain, and arguably the 'minimum' required is increasing; fewer women go 'bare faced' or bare their flesh without hair removal. This project will explore the extent to which beauty norms are changing and how as well as what this means for individuals, for regulation and for clinical practice. It will explore the 'perfectionist trend' that extends the use of medical and scientific procedures to 'cosmetic procedures'. In light of this it will explore how the use and development of such procedures in the service of such norms changes the concepts of 'health', 'normality' and 'perfection' and in turn how these feed into self-understandings and identity, social expectations, medical practice and regulation. The project is timely as it connects 'moral panics' about the sexualisation of culture (which is often connected to claims about appearance and clothing) to worries about the number of cosmetic procedures performed on young girls (often to be 'normal') and the rise of eating disorders. All of these signify the increasing importance of appearance, the narrowing of what is considered 'normal', the increasing pressure to comply to such norms and the increasing reliance on, and expectation of, technology (whether surgical or non-invasive procedures) to provide a means to achieve these ideals. This project looks at the changing ideals, how technology is used, and at the practices, policies and regulation of these practices. It asks whether such changes are fundamental (either to understandings of beauty or to understandings of such practices as 'medical') and whether current practices, such as consent or balancing risk, are appropriate to regulate such practices, or whether the changes are social and as such require different frameworks to address them. While there has been significant work on this in popular literature there has been much less genuinely multidisciplinary engagement connecting the underlying concepts and assumptions to the duties of the medical profession, and to regulation and legislation. This network will address this gap in collaboration and partnership with policy makers, particularly with the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (NCoB). The PI and the NCoB will collaborate on gaining policy buy-in to the work which is of such import to the pubic.","The network's particular strength lies in bringing previously separate disciplinary work into close collaboration with key stakeholders interested in the areas of changing attitudes to body image and beauty norms and the consequent changes to uses of beauty procedures. Particular concerns of the network are portrayal of beauty in popular culture and the inadequacy of existing regulations governing beauty procedures. The existing partnership with the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (NoCB) will be strengthened through the network activities, to which the NoCB has signed up to as an official partner. The NoCB will thus act as an enabler and conduit between the academics and relevant stakeholders.  Who will benefit? Immediate beneficiaries are thus NoCB as the main partner and a broad range of practising clinicians and policy makers from professional medical organisations, regulatory bodies and government departments both in the UK and EU with which the network will directly engage. Indirect and long-term beneficiaries will be the public in general, particularly women and young girls whose daily lives are influenced by changing and dominating ideas of beauty and who are striving to meet these ideals by using a range of different mediums, from normal beauty procedures to medicalised interventions, putting themselves at risk often unknowingly. These beneficiaries will be reached via the social media activities of the network. In addition, the network activities as such include cultural participants, such as artists and journalists alongside medical practitioners and policy makers. How will they benefit? The network will have likely impacts on policy debate and making as well as public discourse. There is growing concern from relevant institutions and public bodies on the lack of regulation of beauty procedures, such as The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence concern about Botox treatments, and these stakeholders will be better informed about the key issues that need to be addressed as the network will explore these for the first time in a multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral approach. The public will be better informed about the underlying risks that come with beauty procedures leading to an enhanced understanding of the major issues that need to be addressed in the area of changing ideas of beauty, from moral and ethical as well as legal perspectives.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL01548X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              We are proposing to conduct research and to exchange knowledge with stakeholders in order to understand how ideas and materials derived from the Iron Age and Roman past (c. 700 BC to AD 400) are drawn upon today in England, Scotland and Wales.   Powerful ideas about European cultural origin stemming from the writings of classical authors who drew a distinction between 'civilization' and 'barbarism' have been used to contrast native peoples with Roman invaders. In Britain concepts of civilization and barbarism have influenced how people understand the extent and character of the territories that make up the UK, the origins of their inhabitants and how they relate to people from overseas. The Iron Age and Roman periods are highly popular in present-day Britain as demonstrated, for example, by the frequency and interest with which important archaeological discoveries are communicated via newspapers, magazines, television, films (e.g. 'Centurion' and 'The Eagle') and novels. Community projects focusing on the Iron Age are addressing themes such as housing and sustainable ways of living, while the Roman past offers opportunities for considering military identity, concepts of civilisation and multicultural origins (see the visual evidence). Ancient monuments dating to these periods and the museums that display them are popular visitor attractions. Re-enacting, metal-detecting and taking part in archaeological projects are generating new and relevant forms of knowledge.   Academic research on the Iron Age and Roman past in the UK is widely recognised across Europe and America for its excellence, but, until now, the exploration of meaning in the past has often been distanced from the interests and concerns of the broader public (Hingley 2015). This project offers the new perspective of studying the living meaning of Iron Age and Roman materials and ideas by examining the creative and variable ways in which stakeholders incorporate the past into their researches, performances and actions. We will also unpick the values of heritage that are specific to the Iron Age and Roman pasts from those that are not. Our methodologies will allow access to significant new bodies of information both online and offline.   We will communicate our findings in order to challenge the divisions that currently separate the interests of stakeholders, including (but not limited to) academic archaeologists, heritage managers, re-enactors, visitors to ancient monuments and teachers. We intend to promote our work by developing existing contacts with researchers and practitioners in archaeology, heritage and museums nationally and internationally. Drawing upon the project team's connections, we will exchange knowledge of our results through digital means, conferences, and publications.","The project will provide benefits for:  POLICY-MAKERS AND FUNDERS IN THE HERITAGE SECTOR (Historic England, Cadw, Historic Scotland, HLF, AHRC, etc.). Policy is gradually moving away from a narrow focus on conservation toward a greater appreciation of the importance of cultural heritage to individuals and communities (e.g. JPI 2014). Research has explored the cultural value of urban and industrial landscapes but approaches regarding ancient monuments generally remain focused on protection. This would seem to be a particularly timely opportunity to influence policy with the creation of English Heritage/Historic England. The perspectives and materials to be developed (Outputs 9, 11) will build upon PI's experience from the 'Tales of the Frontier' project (Hingley 2012), and on the work the present team have undertaken on digital heritage and ethnography.  ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND HERITAGE MANAGERS WORKING IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL MUSEUMS AND OPEN-AIR MUSEUMS. We will communicate a more coordinated and nuanced interpretation of IA&RH that can be drawn upon at monuments and museums. Only limited research has been undertaken to examine the ways that these places interpret the past, we intend to provide academic support for the development of future initiatives (Outputs 6, 9-10).  ARCHAEOLOGISTS WORKING IN LOCAL MUSEUMS, COUNCILS AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL UNITS INVOLVED WITH COMMUNITY PROJECTS either in a managing role or as advisors. There is relatively little synthetic research that addresses the community initiatives funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund or other organizations including AHRC. A set of archaeological guidelines (HLF 2013) focuses on excavation and recording only. This study will provide a fuller assessment of the contributions made by community groups to archaeology which should help justify the resources and to communicate the important role of archaeologists (Output 10).   COMMUNITY GROUPS AND DIGITAL COMMUNITIES with an interest in IA&RH. A number of community projects draw upon archaeological research, (re)construction and living history and we will provide a more informed understanding of the range and character of such work (Output 10). This should help to support the growth of new and existing communities initiatives offline and online (Output 7).   MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO VISIT IA&RH places (ancient monuments, open-air museums and museums). Output 9 will be freely available on the Internet that will itemize, communicate and interpret places in public ownership and the range of values that stakeholders attribute to these.   STORYTELLERS, RE-ENACTORS, DRUIDS AND PAGANS. Archaeologists are often critical of the heritage created by these groups, but by taking a more open approach we seek to communicate and promote a coordinated agenda that draws upon their activities and attitudes to create a broader range of concepts of heritage (Outputs 5-11).  TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS who teach the IA and Roman past can currently draw upon a range of digital sources, some of which are free of charge and others not. We will provide a synthesis of these data sets and will emphasize the importance of IA&RH in school education (archaeology currently remains fairly marginal to the curriculum). The potential to address issues of mobility and frontiers is clearly indicated by existing teaching packs and community projects and we aim to provide an academic context for the educational themes by exploring the potential of IA and Roman places (Output 8).

The United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other global authorities have long debated these conundrums and, to address the expansion of related practices in the 1990s, gave a new meaning to 'humanitarian protection'. However, this meaning has proved to be complicated and problematic. In reality, people claiming to provide humanitarian protection do radically diverse activities, rely on different forms of enforcement and have different ideas about who and how people should be kept safe during conflict.  Even more importantly, despite the expansion of humanitarian protection, people are often not kept safe but are instead left bewildered. People can have very different moral ideas and different fears, not only of physical harm, but also of spiritual, social and cultural harm. Plus, in reality, all actors have limits to their altruism in practice; even, humanitarian protection itself is partly about protecting humanitarians. In addition, as moral schemes are not static but are constantly renegotiated, power dynamics make a difference to these negotiations and subsequent understandings of why and how strangers should be kept safe. These power dynamics can embed hierarchies between men and women, as well as other patterns of social exclusion. We are interested in how people deal with these complex moral, logistical, spiritual and intellectual problems in their daily practices of keeping strangers safe in specific localities during conflict. Our research explores the hidden moral anxieties of national/international humanitarian protection actors as they work in local contexts. We also explore how other actors contest or co-opt these humanitarian ideas and provide different forms of safety. Our research uses history, anthropology, curation, ethnomusicology and theology to explore the practice of the UN and NGOs (both international and national), as well as church leaders, chiefs and other local authority figures.  We focuse on South Sudan and its borderlands. For over forty years, South Sudan has been a seminal site for testing humanitarian protection ideas. Plus, South Sudan is currently experiencing a protracted conflict, including extreme kinds of humanitarian violations. Despite large-scale international attempts at humanitarian protection, South Sudanese have not been safe and millions of people have fled over borders and into neighbouring countries. South Sudanese public authority figures, including chiefs, 'witchdoctors', vigilantes, bishops, Pentecostals, Nuer prophets and women leaders have also used a range of strategies to try to keep people safe. We explore these contested ideas of protection, and the authority entangled within these negotiations. Our team is uniquely placed to carry out this research. Dr Leben Moro and Professor Tim Allen have produced ground-breaking research on protection related themes since the early 1990s. Dr Moro and Dr Naomi Pendle have also carried out some of the only recent research on protection in South Sudan. Plus, our team has nearly a century of combined experience researching in South Sudan and its borderlands.  We also bring new ideas to the discussion by prioritising research and publication by African early career scholars. We do this by increasing the capacity of the University of Juba to offer teaching on research in humanitarian protection.  We, additionally, make sure that our research has a positive impact on humanitarian policy and practice. One way we are doing this is by working closely with three humanitarian organisations, namely an international organisation (Norwegian Refugee Council) but also two South Sudanese organisations (Nile Hope and CARD). Finally, we have an advisory board of high-profile practitioners from other organisations.","Policy Beneficiaries Our research will help policy makers understand and analyse when and why local mechanisms work to keep people safe, and why humanitarian interventions have often failed to guarantee people's safety. The research will specifically inform policy debates in the UK government and beyond about the various themes including the localisation agenda and the role of national NGOs in humanitarian protection, the Protection of Civilian Sites, the ongoing crisis in South Sudan and Sudan, and what works to keep people safe in contexts of extreme humanitarian violations. We will engage in various face-to-face policy discussions and will publish policy briefs and blogs (of that kind that we have been doing successfully for several years). In South Sudan, we will also make use of the DFID-funded Conflict Sensitivity Research Facility to disseminate our findings and make them meaningful to policy makers. In addition, our research will inform the Office of the Prime Minister in Uganda who works as the policy conduit for refugee response within its borders and where DFID has seconded specialist protection advisors to integrate strategies for the response. Practitioner Beneficiaries Our practitioner partners will not only contribute to the research project but will benefit directly in multiple and varied ways. Their policies and practices will all be informed by the research findings and time will be spent in tailoring bespoke recommendations to these partners' programmes. In addition, Nile Hope and the Diocese of Wau will benefit from increased in-house research capacity on humanitarian protection through the capacity building of their staff. NRC will also benefit from the opportunity to develop national staff capacity to contribute to protection research and political analysis. In addition, the project's advisory board is made up of leaders within humanitarian organisations and the United Nations. The project will speak to their questions and contribute to realistic solutions.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT007524%2F1

Or outside the white gaze? On her own terms? Or outside the narrative built around us by the media and governments?"" (Mariam Khan, 'Introduction', It's Not About the Burqa, p. 1). Focusing on writing by women deemed 'popular' rather than 'literary', the initiative engages with under-studied popular and genre texts (including romance, chick lit, comics, graphic novels, detective fiction, Young Adult, fantasy, autobiography, memoir, and science fiction) from a range of established critical disciplinary perspectives and across languages. The project is interested in looking more closely at this writing alongside its production context through a focus on publishers and editors. The project asks: * How does genre act as a 'filter' for Muslim women's writing?  * What opportunities do popular and genre fiction provide for challenging the dominant 'filters' on Muslim women's voices?  * What contexts and pressures do popular fiction publishing and production models provide?  * How are Muslim women authors engaging with and transforming established narrative and genre forms? These areas of expertise have not been brought together substantially before - this is an opportunity to gather disparate expertise and bring together a global network of scholars to discuss and produce focused work on this topic. By bringing together experts on popular fiction, publishing and genre, with established researchers of Muslim women's writing, this networking project aims to produce new and much-needed collaborative interventions and establish a critical platform for future research. In the first year, the steering committee will develop 5 local 'nodes', each highlighting an area of particular expertise. Through in-person or online events, each node will focus on developing scholarly networks more locally, creating local community impact, and work as platforms for facilitating a dialogue between local and diasporic scholars of popular genre.  1. Translation - led by Dr Peter Cherry A workshop on translation of Turkish and Arabic popular fiction with translators, representatives from publishers; a discussion on Turkish soap operas' popularity within Turkey and abroad with invited academics, journalists and actors; collaboration with students taking modules on world literature, migration in contemporary world fiction and translation studies.  2. Education - led by Dr Amy Burge A workshop with local educational partners, National Literacy Trust, policymakers; collaboration with students on third-year module Muslim Women's Popular Fiction. 3. Literature and Decoloniality - led by Dr Aroosa Kanwal A workshop and online discussion with translators, researchers, educators and students on indigenous literary traditions and contemporary Muslim women's Anglophone genre writing.  4. Text and Image - led by Dr Esra Santesso A workshop with graphic novelists and cartoonists (potentially Ozge Samanci, Huda Fahmy, Deena Mohamed, Leila Abdelrazaq), comics scholars, on popular visual genres and Islamic feminism.  5. Mobilities - led by Dr Lucinda Newns A workshop with academics and authors about how works of popular and genre fiction have travelled across borders and enabled migrant, indigenous, minority ethnic and decolonial perspectives to emerge in the global literary marketplace.   In the second year, the network will host an international conference to bring together researchers from local nodes and elsewhere, encouraging collaboration across languages, disciplines and genres. The conference programme will include scheduled time for researchers to meet previously identified research partners and structured space and workshops in which network members can plan for future collaboration (for example, the preparation of co-authored articles for the edited book, or planning for future funding bids).",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV011294%2F1

This has included the construction of hundreds of new theatres and arts centres that offer artists and audiences new opportunities. The development of the human resources to match the new infrastructure is now a priority and the emerging arts producers in China, beyond the Eastern seaboard region, have few opportunities for professional development or international exchange.  To address this issue and to assist in developing the UK's opportunities for new exchanges with China, an existing collaboration between ResCen Research Centre, Middlesex University and the Beijing Dance Academy, has been extended to include arts sector partners - China's Poly Theatre Group and the UK's Chinese Arts Now supported by Arts Council England. The proposal will create four pilot project presentations by leading and emerging UK producers, Emma Gladstone, Dance Umbrella; Farooq Chaudhry, Akram Khan Company; An-Ting Chang, Chinese Arts Now; and Joanna Dong, Performance Infinity. These will be presented at online Producers Forums hosted by the Poly Theatre Group in Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Kunming and then made available online as part of a resource pack called The Producers Toolbox: The Way/Dào of the Producer.  The hosting of the events in Poly Theatre Group venues will allow local participants to attend in person to view each presentation in a large-screen format and to take part in the UK-China discussions that follow the presentations via a modern and effective internet connection. Presentations will also be accessible to a wider audience online throughout mainland China and in Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as in the UK. Each Forum will be moderated by Beijing Dance Academy Vice-President, Professor Xu and ResCen Research Centre Director, Professor Christopher Bannerman.  The UK presenters selected for this pilot project work in different contexts, are all experienced in international collaborations and their material will be carefully tailored for Chinese arts sector colleagues. Additionally, all presenters are widely acknowledged to be established or emerging leaders in their fields who are prepared to engage in lively dialogue and exchange, and to participate in any future collaborative projects. The project is designed to make the first critical link enabling an ongoing exchange between the arts professionals who can create new international collaborative projects and to share information on how to make best use of the available opportunities. The presentations address the new Covid-19 realities and include the discussion of digital performance as well as looking ahead to a time when live performance with an audience will again be possible. The pilot project also assesses the use of the online mode for exchange and network events with Chinese colleagues when it is not possible to engage in the personal interactions that are traditionally important in this sector. Further planned developments include the creation of presentations by Chinese producers which will feature at future online China-UK Forums before being added to The Producers Toolbox.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW000865%2F1

Petrarch's influence on poetic and linguistic practice was epoch-defining in Renaissance Europe. His vernacular poetry became the supreme model for lyric poetry and indeed for refined literary style itself. It spawned countless admirers and imitators in England, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and elsewhere. In Italy, Petrarch's poetry provided the basis upon which to establish the standards for developing and regulating the Italian language.  This project envisages a 3-year research collaboration focusing on the production and dissemination of commentaries and other exegetical writings upon Petrarch's vernacular verse (that is, his 'Canzoniere' or 'Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta' and his 'Triumphi') in Renaissance Italy. The collaboration involves the Centre for the Study of the Renaissance at Warwick, the School of Languages, Cultures and Societies at Leeds, and the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures and John Rylands Research Institute, Manchester.  With the rise of Petrarch's reputation and influence came the emergence, especially in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, of a rich and extensive body of critical commentary upon both of his vernacular poetic works. In manuscript and increasingly in print, we find over twenty major full-length commentaries (many in multiple reprints), several hundred items of other exegesis such as annotations in editions, public and private lectures ('lezioni'), dialogues, and treatises. And yet, quite remarkably, especially given Petrarch's influence, diffusion and transnational appeal, no attempt has been made to catalogue or understand as whole this body of critical interpretation. This ambitious collaborative project aims to address this neglect and to lay the foundations for all future research on the Italian context, and, given Italy's formative role in this period, for research on Petrarch's afterlife in a variety of other European contexts - by providing the following: 1. the first fully searchable online census of Petrarch commentaries, public and private lessons and related writings (c. 1350-c.1650). The database will incorporate a wealth of information on the authors, printers, dedicatees, paratexts (the corpus is especially rich in annotations, lives, commentaries, illustrations, and maps). 2. a digital library with full digitizations of 75 texts of commentary/exegesis made publically accessible 3. an enriched set of catalogue records, based on the census, surfaced to a worldwide audience of researchers via enhanced local catalogue records uploaded to the national and international union research catalogues 4. 10 academic articles and two sets of conference proceedings which will provide ground-breaking studies of: (i) the diffusion of the various works in both manuscript and print, their mechanisms of circulation and the interests/roles of particular printers; (ii) the major genres of critical discussion (e.g., public readings, commentaries, dialogues), thereby determining the extent to which the content and strategies used in the discussion differed by genre; (iii) the interactions between major commentators and other exegetes (not only on Petrarch but also on classical and vernacular authors), and the philosophical interests and citational practices of select commentators.  5. an international workshop will consider commentary on Petrarch in this period outside Italy. 6. a permanent online exhibition (based on the digital library), a month-long exhibition at the Marciana Library, Venice (plans are at an advanced stage), writers' workshops and school visits.  Since so little is known about commentary/exegesis on Petrarch as a whole, the project will define its contours, establishing a new field of study that will appeal to specialists across literature, language, philosophy, science, religion, print and scribal culture.","By creating and disseminating knowledge about a major cultural, literary and linguistic phenomenon in Renaissance Europe, Petrarch Commentary and Exegesis in Renaissance Italy, c. 1350-c.1650 will be of considerable public interest.  Impact will be directed at two main user groups: 1) (throughout the project but especially in year 3) librarians/those responsible for databases/meta-catalogues. Our impact activities are intended to have a transformative effect upon the presentation and understanding of Renaissance holdings in libraries worldwide. In particular, through close collaboration with the JRL - which has one of the strongest holdings of early prints of Petrarch in the UK -,we will provide: (a) enriched set of catalogue entries/bibliographical descriptions on the basis of the project census for 60 relevant prints held in the library (the rich bibliographical findings for the book-objects will be surfaced to a worldwide audience via enhanced local catalogue records uploaded to the national and international union research catalogues such as Copac, OCLC, and EDIT16); (b) a freely available digital library will also be created for these prints; and (c) a permanent digital exhibition based on these 60 digitized prints. In addition, detailed discussion has been progressed with three other libraries that have relevant holdings, one in Italy, two in the US - the Newberry Library, Chicago (which has agreed to provide digital images); the Hesburgh Library, University of Notre Dame (which has agreed to make a further 15-20 digitizations); and the Biblioteca Marciana, Venice. Plans are advanced for a month-long physical exhibition (with visitor book, data projection of our census and exhibition catalogue) at the Marciana (in Spring 2019) following a one-to-one meeting with the Director of the Marciana, Dr. Maurizio Messina, in April 2015 and further follow-up on the scientific dimensions of the project (both with Dr. Messina and the Head of Manuscripts and Rare Prints, Dott.ssa Susy Marcon). The Biblioteca Marciana has some of the richest holdings of Petrarch commentary worldwide and falls under the remit of the Ministry of Culture in Italy. It is part of a ticketed tourist route (available also at no cost) that brings 20,000 visitors per month to the library and its exhibition halls. Further impacts upon librarians and users/heads of databases will be achieved through a workshop at the John Rylands Library with librarians and database directors. 2) (in years 1 and 2) school children and adult learners interested in Renaissance studies and creative writing. This will be achieved in two main ways. First, by means of two workshops held at Leeds, both in collaboration with the School of English at Leeds University. Workshop 1, linked to the 2016 celebrations of Shakespeare, will profile, via public readings introduced by a short public lecture, the influence of Petrarch on the English tradition. Workshop 2 will be a practical writing workshop and will engage the same user groups in reading and writing poetry in relation to core questions underpinning the project (especially the role of commentary and exegesis in shaping our idea and understanding of poetry). The best poems written on the day will be published on-line on the project website and there will be a prize for 14-18 year old group for the best composition. Second, two school visits (end of Year 2) using established networks in the Midlands for up to 20 attendees will be held: one at Warwick's Modern Record Centre (MRC) where Renaissance materials will be used in a show-and-tell format. Two follow-up visits to specific schools in the Midlands and West Yorkshire will also be offered. Throughout years 1-2, initial engagement will take place via a Warwick-hosted web-site featuring images, a blog and podcasts, and a dedicated Twitter account. In addition, we will liaise with the Arts Communications Officer to secure publications in relevant outlets.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN006070%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Nottingham is one of England's major historic urban centres, but relatively little is known about its history and archaeology and many of its most important heritage assets are hidden, subterranean and unrecognised - including significant archaeological excavations telling the story of the city's Anglo-Saxon, Viking and medieval origins. It also has a unique legacy of over 870 extant or recorded sandstone caves, which are a vital part of the city's constantly evolving built heritage and are still used for a variety of commercial, community and private functions. Several groups of caves are open to the public but much remains unknown about their history and archaeology and this inhibits their development as a visitor and heritage resource. Nottingham's 'hidden heritage' is exemplified by the Broad Marsh, a dynamic waterfront area once at the heart of the medieval townscape but controversially swept away in the 1970s for the construction of the Broadmarsh shopping centre, burying a dense cluster of medieval streets and cave networks, some of which survive and are open to the public (managed by the National Justice Museum), others of which were lost or are currently inaccessible. A major redevelopment of the city's southern quarter, including refurbishment of the Broadmarsh shopping centre, was abruptly halted by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and precipitated the key leaseholder and site developer - Intu Properties - to collapse into administration (June 2020) and forced the surrender of their lease back to the City Council. Broadmarsh is a half-demolished wasteland blighting the city centre, but from this unexpected failure arises a unique challenge and opportunity for the City Council to redevelop c.12.5 acres of brownfield land at the centre of the historic core. The City Council have the freedom to shape a new city offering of leisure, commercial, retail and cultural experiences and maximise a rare opportunity to completely transform the city's sense of place. Broadmarsh is the first shopping centre to disappear in the UK but is unlikely to be the last, and this redevelopment will be an exemplar for other cities negotiating the shift from retail to experience as the driver of the 21st-century urban economy. A Broad Marsh Advisory Board with a place-making agenda has been established to support this opportunity, chaired by Greg Nugent, former Director of Brand, Marketing and Culture for the London Olympics and Paralympics in 2012. The City Council published its 15-year Heritage Strategy in 2015 setting out an ambition for heritage-led regeneration to attract substantial inward investment into the city's open spaces, historic buildings and local communities. In implementing this strategy the latest and most ambitious project has been the successful transformation of Nottingham Castle (re-opened June 2021) catalysed by a major Heritage Lottery grant, underpinned by research mobilisation from the University of Nottingham. The public consultation on the future of the Broadmarsh site identified heritage as a key priority. This project is therefore designed to respond to this unique opportunity to put Arts and Humanities research at the heart of the redevelopment programme and to mobilise academic research and expertise to inform a high-quality heritage and place-making agenda in the site's cultural and visitor experience offer. The project will bring together academics across multiple disciplines and key external stakeholders to map existing knowledge of archaeological and historical resources for the Broad Marsh area and its associated caves, liaise with local communities about their memories and involvement in the Broad Marsh excavations, and use this knowledge to develop research-informed interpretive narratives that bring to the surface the historical, cultural and economic potential of 'hidden heritage' to engage citizens and visitors with an exciting and dynamic experience of Nottingham as an historic place.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW008653%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              ""The truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth."" These words are familiar from courtroom dramas. But what do they mean? Debates about the nature of truth have long been prominent in philosophy. But relatively little attention has been given to the question what it is for a statement to be the whole truth, or equivalently, what it takes for a description to be total, rather than merely partial. This project seeks to redress that. We will study the logic and semantics of expressions such as ""and that's all'' or ""and that's the whole truth"" - so-called ""totality operators"".  The topic is of crucial importance for metaphysics. One of the central questions in metaphysics is what the world is fundamentally like. One candidate answer is materialism, or physicalism, which takes only physical facts to be fundamental. However, this notion of fundamentality is notoriously elusive, and so we need to know more about what materialism amounts to. A typical first stab at an explanation would be this: materialism requires that every fact about the world is entailed by the physical facts. But it has been recognized that this would leave materialism without the fighting chance that it deserves: certain negative truths, like the truth (if it is one) that there are no angels, are not entailed by the physical facts, but nonetheless do not threaten materialism. A plausible remedy that has been suggested is that materialism boils down to the thesis that every truth is entailed by the physical facts together with a ""that's all"" or ""that's the whole truth"" clause. This prompts two questions. First, does that thesis adequately capture physicalism? Second, is the thesis philosophically defensible? In our attempt to answer these questions, we will draw on the results of our investigations into the meaning of totality operators.  Outside the context of fundamental metaphysics, totality operators will typically be restricted: not all truths are always relevant, after all. We will study the logic of such restricted totality operators, and apply them to issues in epistemology and in legal theory. One central topic in epistemology concerns the conditions under which one counts as having epistemic justification for believing certain propositions. It is initially appealing to hold that if one has a perceptual experience as of p then one has justification for believing p. But evidence is defeasible. Even though a certain body of evidence provides justification for believing a proposition, an augmented body of evidence may not. As such, the above principles, or any like it, could be exceptionless unless we add to their antecedents some kind of totality clause - a condition to the effect that one has no further evidence or no further 'relevant' evidence or no defeating evidence. Rarely, though, is this totality requirement explained in much detail or investigated formally. We will use specifically epistemic totality operators to illuminate it, and thus to clarify the nature of defeasible reasoning.    The part of the project concerned with legal theory will use case law on perjury as a data source of reflective, yet philosophically untutored intuitions about what counts as ""the whole truth"", and explore how far formal ""that's-it"" operators are capable of capturing the meaning of that phrase. This will help to clarify a notoriously difficult legal doctrine. In the theory of legal drafting, lawmakers sometimes try to make statutes ""judge proof"" by enforcing a tacit ""that's-it""-clause that limits the scope of judicial discretion. In the domain of abstract jurisprudential theory, the doctrine of formalism, with its slogan ""the positive law is all there is"", appears to involve some totality claims. We will investigate to what extent totality operators can be a useful tool in legal drafting, and whether they allows us to give a coherent account of formalism. Our results may lead to improvements in jury instructions and computer-assisted legal drafting.","We will bring the results of our research to two key audiences outside of the higher education sector - legal professionals and members of the general public with an interest in fundamental philosophical questions. We will accomplish this through organising and attending specifically targeted events - the workshop of the Bell Centre for Forensic Studies and Legal Reasoning, the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence & Law, a workshop for the sub-project on legal theory, and a widely advertised public lecture. In the part of the project concerned with legal theory, we will examine reported court decisions that explicitly reason about the conditions under which the whole truth was or was not told, and ask how we can account for that reasoning through the rigorous formal framework developed in our team. Another relevant class of documents consists of jury instructions, which aim to explain the oath, and the terms used in it, to laypeople. We will examine to what extent they capture the meaning of these terms, and ask whether they could be improved. A refined understanding of how the expression ""the whole truth"" is to be understood could feed into the guidelines for how judges are to instruct juries, and into the actual jury instructions.  We will work together with legal practitioners and judges to overcome the challenge of expressing theoretical insights about the meaning of the ""whole truth"" in a non-technical and widely accessible way. Schafer is a member of SIPR, The Scottish Institute for Policing Research, a collaboration between Scottish universities and the Police Service of Scotland. He is also a Co-Director of the Bell Centre for Forensic Statistics and Legal Reasoning, which organises an annual workshop for SIPR on the general topic of Legal Reasoning and Evidence Law. In June 2016, project members will present their work on the meaning of ""the whole truth"" in legal contexts and on reasoning with incomplete evidence at such a workshop. That workshop is heavily promoted to legal practitioners, judges and police officers, and thus provides the project team with an opportunity to reach one key group outside of the Higher Education sector upon whom our research can have impact.  The workshop organised by the Bell Centre will allow us to identify potential partners within this key group, and invite them - as speakers or delegates as appropriate - to the international workshop on sub-project (d) that we are organising in Edinburgh in March 2017. That workshop will bring together philosophers, legal theorists and legal professionals to offer a range of different perspectives, and will further develop the network for knowledge exchange that we are aiming to build.  Another area where this project can have impact is legal drafting. In this, lawmakers are increasingly assisted by formal and computational tools. Lawmakers may be interested in making law ""judge-proof"" - reducing the discretion of judges. Alternatively, they may wish to avoid principles that are overly rigid, and to allow judges a certain amount of discretion in considering further factors. Standard formal representations of legal rules and principles are not particularly suited to promote either aim. In contrast, totality operators of the kind that we are going to study seem tailor-made for it. We will look at extant computational tools that assist lawmakers in the task of legal drafting, and examine in what ways they might be improved. Our project thus has the potential to lead to better computer programmes for checking whether new regulations are consistent and complete. We have budgeted for two project members to attend the biennial International Conference on Artificial Intelligence & Law, to take place in mid-2017, to present our work and liaise with experts in computer-assisted legal drafting.  Further, the PI will deliver a public lecture to communicate some of the knowledge gained during the project to a wider audience.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM009610%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              PROJECT AIMS By the end of the rabbinic period (70CE-c.500CE) Judaism had developed an extensive set of beliefs about demons. Jewish literature from this period connects these beliefs to specific texts from the Hebrew Bible. Most of these texts had nothing to do with demons in their original historical contexts. How and why did texts that originally had nothing to do with demons come to be understood as texts that spoke of demons? This project will examine this phenomenon, which we term 'demonic exegesis', by asking: - Which biblical texts did Jews in the rabbinic period connect with demons? - When were these biblical texts first associated with demons? - How do these traditions relate to Christian biblical interpretation connected to demons? This project brings together the study of demonology, biblical interpretation, and Jewish-Christian interaction in the period 70CE-c.500CE. It considers how and why the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament came to play such a significant role in Jewish demonologies and asks what relationship this has to developments in Christian thought.  RESEARCH CONTEXT The project will make an important contribution to on-going scholarly debates about the origins, development, and influence of Jewish ideas about demonic forces in the rabbinic period. The study of Jewish demonology has received considerable attention in recent decades. Jewish demonology in the rabbinic period has been approached in two ways: through cross-cultural analyses and diachronic studies. The prevalence of beliefs in demons in Babylonian sources in particular has led scholars to evaluate the extent to which beliefs prevalent in Sassanian culture have been integrated into rabbinic sources. Diachronic studies have focused on tracing the roots of concepts, such as the Evil Inclination, or individual demonic figures, such as Samael, back to earlier stages of Jewish history. Extensive studies of demonology in the Dead Sea Scrolls has made this type of diachronic analysis possible and enabled scholars to understand better the extent of continuity and change across these decisive and transformative periods in Jewish history.  The study of early Christianity has also witnessed a renewed interest in the demonic realm. Several 'biographies' of Satan have appeared and important studies have considered the connection between Satan, developments in angelology in the Hellenistic period, and traditions of fallen angels. Practices of exorcism in the New Testament and the early Church and the notion of spiritual combat have also been the focus of scholarly studies in recent years. The proposed project will build on these developments, bringing a fresh perspective to the discussion by considering the development of demonologies as a phenomenon of biblical interpretation. As such it will yield not only new and exciting results that will deepen our understanding of Jewish demonology in the period, but it will also make a significant contribution to advancing our understanding of the extent and nature of the 'Exegetical Encounter' between Jews and Christians in a formative period for both traditions.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS This project will enhance our understanding of the dynamics of biblical interpretation in the 1st-6th centuries CE, its role in Jewish-Christian interaction and identity formation, and in the development of demonologies. Its results will be disseminated to academic beneficiaries through presentations at academic conferences and publications (journal articles, book).  Because beliefs that emerged in this period continue to shape patterns of contemporary thought and practice, the results of this project will be of interest to wider society. The project will ensure it has societal impact by working with Project Partners to deliver a public educational event that will be recorded and edited into an audio podcast.","WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH? There has been a huge growth in interest outside the academic research community in the topics of possession, exorcism, and spiritual healing in recent decades, with which this project aims to engage.  The growth of Christian Charismatic movements encouraged an expectation that spiritual gifts of healing would be manifest, while Evangelical Fundamentalists - suspicious of Charismatic emotionalism - have developed their own interest in deliverance focused on Christ's power to overcome Satan (Collins 2009). A revival of sacramentalism in other sections of the Church has also reignited interest in rites of healing, including deliverance (The Archbishops' Council 2000: 1-15). The growing popularity of the occult and New Age movements, the rapid growth of immigrant communities from cultures in which demons were regarded as a hazard of everyday life, and media portrayals (e.g. The Exorcist, 1974) stimulated interest outside the churches, requiring a response from the major denominations (e.g. Petitpierre 1972). Psychiatry has also taken an interest in the therapeutic value of deliverance ministries (McNamara 2011: I, 1-11; II, 1-44).  Cases such as the notorious 1974 Barnsley murder and the tragic death of Victoria Climbié (2000) - both connected to accusations of demonic possession - prompted the major Christian denominations to implement new safeguarding policies (e.g. Archbishops' Council 2010, 2011). The government reacted too by amending the 1989 Children Act (2004) to incorporate specific provision for abuse connected to beliefs in spirit possession (Stobart 2006); further non-statutory guidance was issued in 2007 and a National Action Plan to Tackle Child Abuse Linked to Faith was launched in 2012.  Working with two Project Partners this project will engage this growing public interest in order to affect the climate of public opinion; it will also initiate discussions with key stakeholders with a view to generating future collaborations outside the academy and across disciplines within the academy.  Outside the academic research community the following groups will therefore benefit directly from the research: The media: - International radio and audio-podcast audiences interested in important ethical and moral issues connected to faith. 'Third sector' organisations:  - The Bethlem Museum of the Mind, the museum of the Bethlem Royal Hospital, the first institution in the UK to specialise in the care of the mentally ill. HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH? The Bethlem Museum of the Mind aims to support learning about the history of mental healthcare and treatment. The museum's interest in the project arises from a recognition that the Bible has provided - and continues to provide - a symbolic language that individuals have used to understand and articulate their mental health experiences.  There is huge popular interest in the topics of possession, exorcism, and spiritual healing in wider society. The project will therefore be of benefit to the wider public in general by contributing to the shaping of public understanding of religious beliefs and practices past and present. Specifically, it will achieve this by disseminating its results to radio and audio-podcast audiences.

"Funding details                                                                                                              Research into reading and the value that it holds for individuals has been an area of rising interest for scholars within a constellation of related fields, including book history, cultural studies, the sociology of culture and literary studies. However, until relatively recently, researchers have been largely restricted to gathering accounts of readers' experiences from sources with limited evidence such as marginalia or accounts in diaries and letters, which are time-consuming to gather, or from somewhat artificial contexts such as interviews, questionnaires and focus groups, where what Pierre Bourdieu has termed the ""legitimacy effect"" - which prompts individuals to report on what they consider they ought to have read, or ought to think, rather than what they have actually read or actually think - may hamper the investigation. The advent of social media platforms, and the unprecedented amount of user-generated data they produce, has opened up compelling new avenues for research into reading, an experience long considered personal and private which is increasingly coming into view as a cultural activity whose social dimensions are equally as complex and as vital to understand.  Not only has user-generated data from social media platforms given researchers very large amounts of data to work with, it has also added new forms of information, such as numerical ratings of books accompanying descriptive reviews, and information about readers' ""affinity"" with others depending on the number of books in their shared collections (a more complex version of Amazon's recommendation algorithm that suggests books that users may wish to buy by comparing their purchasing or browsing activity to those of others). With these new forms of data, however, has come a parallel obligation for scholars to develop robust methodologies for their analysis, including the capacity to make use of the rich metadata - the temporal and geospatial information attached to some of the information produced by users - on social network sites. In the commercial world, such information is already exploited by marketers through such techniques as sentiment analysis - automated analysis that can identify whether a tweet is broadly negative or positive - but such techniques are too crude for understanding the complex interplay between texts and readers as meaning and value are negotiated. This is the gap that this project seeks to fill. By capturing information from two platforms used by individuals to report on their reading and to connect with other readers - Twitter and the book-collection website LibraryThing - it will investigate what this born-digital data can tell us about readers' interactions with texts by taking samples of this data, and exploring and refining the methods that can be used to deal with it, particularly as it contains both numerical and descriptive elements. It will apply techniques of computational analysis to this data to identify significant patterns in relation to three areas. First, thematic and topical information: what do readers choose to foreground when they go to the trouble of broadcasting their thoughts on Twitter or LibraryThing? Second, chronological trends: do particular terms become prominent in online interactions at particular times, and how might these trends relate to events such as the publication of books which achieve mass popularity such as the Harry Potter volumes or Fifty Shades of Grey? Third, geographical influences: do socio-economic factors or the existence of book-related institutions such as bookstores and libraries play a role in influencing the spatial distribution of online interactions around books? By using these disparate methodologies in concert, and finding ways to productively combine them, the project will both advance knowledge about the intrinsic value texts represent to readers, and point to ways that this research can be carried out with ever-larger bodies of data in the future.","The beneficiaries of this research are, broadly speaking, the range of actors and institutions involved in authoring, producing and distributing books, and those engaged in facilitating engagement with literature such as reader development librarians, educators and book group leaders. Some of these roles are captured by Robert Darnton's influential 1982 diagram of the communications circuit, but in an era in which when some texts never make - or indeed need to make - the transition from the digital screen to the printed page, additional actors need to be added to Darnton's model, such as the programmers who refine the search algorithms that take users' search engine queries and produce results which direct them to one book over another, and those who run online communities such as LibraryThing whose attraction is such that they can sustain participation by users who may never meet any of their interlocutors face-to-face.  These actors have various vested interests in learning more about the complex interplay of interrelated qualities that makes a text particularly appealing, challenging or otherwise memorable to a reader, and will benefit from the research in line with those interests. Reader development librarians seeking a book for a citywide ""one book"" programme that will appeal to a wide range of readers, for instance, will benefit from insights into what readers report enjoying about particular books as they make their choice. Those involved in producing book group guides - whether commercially, voluntarily, or as part of third-sector work - will be able to gain a sense of the kinds of themes readers are drawn to discussing, and those topics or textual elements to which readerly attention may need to be more explicitly drawn. Published authors, or writers seeking publication, may find it helpful to learn what kind of textual elements generate excitement among readers as they frame their books to publishers and literary agents. Similarly, publishers attempting to bring their lists to the attention of an audience with ever-growing claims on its digital attention will benefit from knowledge about the substantive content of online book discussions and conversations on Twitter, especially as these relate to events in the publishing world that become prominent enough to merit media interest (such as the advent of another Fifty Shades of Grey or a book and movie cross-promotion such as the Twilight franchise). The geospatial component of the analysis (which, as detailed elsewhere in this proposal, will be closely tied to the thematic and chronological analysis) will have an additional group of beneficiaries: municipal and community authorities with responsibility for planning. This group will be able to use the GIS produced by the project to examine the relationship between, on the one hand, the physical emplacement of literary institutions such as libraries, bookstores, and locations hosting book groups such as cafes, pubs and private homes, and, on the other, spatial data revealing where online conversations around books tend to occur, and hence the physical spaces where book-related activities can be understood to cluster.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL005069%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              AIMS AND OBJECTIVES  This Anglo-Brazilian research project takes advantage of the complex and often spectacular legacy of architectural Modernism in both London and Sao Paulo (SP), and examines the public spaces in and around seminal examples of large scale Modernist architecture in both cities. In a social context of growing demand for greater democratic authorship and ownership of the built environment, in particular its public realm, the roles of the architect and of design need wider and deeper examination. The project will use the analysis of work from the 1960s and 70s in both cities as a way of reflecting historically on contemporary public space design, an important contribution to the current debates on 'place-making'. The research teams from London and Sao Paulo will:  1) investigate the role of the architect in the production of contemporary public space in Sao Paulo and London from the perspective of the architect's very different role during the period of High Modernism (1960s/70s) in both cities;  2) examine whether there positive aspects to architectural Modernism in Sao Paulo and London that can be recovered to address the low quality of much contemporary public space in both cities, and  3) explore possible relationships between traditional top-down design in both countries, and the growing interest in the UK in participatory approaches, within the context of the contemporary design of public spaces in both cities? Does greater democracy in the delivery of the built environment increase its quality? its popularity? 4) develop and disseminate a wider and deeper understanding of the relation between the authorship and ownership of public space, post-war and now in both cities. CONTEXT OF THE RESEARCH:  Brazil had a 'golden period' of Modernism, the result of a social pact between the architect and society. This period and this pact are long over, and it could be argued that England, apart from a brief interlude centred around the Festival of Britain, never enjoyed a 'golden period', resisting Modernism's often alienating expression in built form. Today there are marked similarities between the two countries: they both have world class financial capitals, London and Sao Paulo, and they both have multicultural populations. They both suffer from a wide divide between rich and poor, and from chronic housing shortages. Most importantly, their cities think about public space defensively, mirroring social segregation with spatial segregation. The desertion of crime-ridden public space in Sao Paulo and its over-surveillance in London are symptoms of urban failure unanticipated by the optimism and egalitarianism of Modernism.  The Brazilian and UK teams will therefore select important Modernist and contemporary public space case studies in both cities to investigate the role of the architect in their production, and to discover whether useful knowledge can be transferred between cities in the interests of more 'successful' public spaces - i.e. enjoyed and frequented by the urban population as a whole. APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS:  Architects, urban designers, and developers will benefit from a better understanding of the design of successful public spaces, and will gain a wider perspective on alternative forms of more participatory design that shift the centrality of the designer (and the developer) to varying degrees. Planners and city councils will gain a greater appreciation of the role of design in the creation of public spaces, and of the ways in which the designer can subvert or contribute to their success. Academics will benefit from a cross-cultural comparison that examines the Modernist production of public space in a new way - from the point of view of the designer and design practice. They will also benefit from a view that challenges fashionable ideas about the automatic undesirability of top-down design.","The cross-cultural Public Spaces and the Architect projectis targeted at many audiences beyond the academic community (see 'Academic Beneficiaries'), in the interests of an improved understanding of the role of the architect in public space design, and consequently an improvement in public space design itself. Our built environment partners are the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the professional body of the architecture profession in the UK, which oversees architectural education, lobbies for the role of architecture in the production of the built environment, and promotes architectural culture, including its history, andthe Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), and its International Development Network (IDN), which are committed to greater synergies between planning and urban design, and greater public awareness of the development of the public realm by both planners and designers. Both these bodies have a stake in the role of the architect in the built environment, and/or in the delivery of successful public spaces. They will therefore be keenly interested in a project thatchallenges the prevailing acceptance of the diminished role of the design professional in the production of public spaces, and which makes suggestions for improving the quality of public spaces by means of lessons drawn from two cultures and two time periods. There will be an immediate impact in 2017 - when the results and conclusions of the research are presented to our partners and discussed with them in terms of their contemporary application - and a long-term impact, as those to whom the research was presented disseminate it to other decision makers, in the interests of 'Enhancing quality of life, health and creative output'. Our first UK government project partner is the British Council, which develops cultural relations in over 100 countries, working with thousands of policymakers, academics, curators and teachers in the UK and abroad to develop policy, professional standards and civil society in partner countries. For them, the primary interest in the project is in a successful cross-cultural collaboration between two HEIs, one in London and one in Sao Paulo. The means by which we collaborated, and repeatability of those means, will, if successful, influence funding policy on future collaborations, and serve as a useful template for arts and humanities research partnerships. The second is Design Council CABE, a semi-autonomous government body charged with improving the built environment and ensuring that places and communities are resilient and adaptable. They are consulted by Local Authorities across England, and by central government on developments of any size, and will welcome evidence of the role and importance of design in the delivery of public spaces.Our Brazilian government partner is the Municipal Secretariat of Culture, Department of Historical Patrimony (DPH) in Sao Paulo, for which Prof. Lefèvre has worked as president of CONRESP (see CV). The Municipal Secretariat for Culture is responsible for many important Sao Paulo cultural institutions. The research will contribute to policy formation/revision on historic conservationin the city. Again, some impact will be immediate (2016/17), as the research is presented to, and discussed with, these partners, and some will be long term, as this example of collaboration is referred to later as evidence useful for funding decisions. In addition, our Research Fellows and PhD student will benefit greatly from the project, first in terms of cross-cultural collaboration, and the negotiation and open-mindedness that requires, which translates easily into other employment sectors, and second, in terms of transferable generic skills: writing and presentation skills, mapping and data analysis skills, visualisation and communication skills. This skills impact will develop over the course of the three year project, as our Fellows and PhD student pursue the research and its dissemination",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007475%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              We want 1 million people to directly benefit from new adaptations of Leapfrog tools by unlocking the potential for practitioners across the UK and beyond to work at new scales. We will build on the success of the Leapfrog project by working with new public and third sector partners to help them engage with large groups. This will range from community meetings with hundreds of people through to some interactions that will have over 100,000 people using an adapted Leapfrog tool in a Design Week. To do this we will use co-design to collaboratively create and adapt Leapfrog tools with our partners, giving them tailored resources to support their work, and producing shareable tools available freely worldwide. Amongst the many challenges faced by the public sector at this time, there is a growing need to meaningfully involve more and more citizens, service users and communities in the difficult decisions that affect them. Scaling Up Leapfrog responds to this need by enabling our partners to directly take on the challenges that surround engaging hundreds of thousands of people in meaningful, creative dialogue. With our partners we will co-design Leapfrog tools to support engagement with 80-100 people at a time, a significant shift in scale from common engagement practice that generally engages ten or twenty people at a time. We will also collaborate with our partners to unlock new scales for parallel engagement, producing Leapfrog tools that help form connections between multiple events in a single initiative. Our partners range from those in public health (Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group), to national charity networks (Food Power), international design networks (World Design Weeks Network) and museums (Victoria and Albert Museum). These partners each seek to enable their staff to perform effective, creative engagement with an increasing number of participants. For some of our partners this is driven by a desire to make a population more health aware and to develop a social movement to that end, engaging with the most disadvantaged people and helping their voices have an effect in decision-making or to help eradicate food poverty by drawing on the expertise of people living in food poverty. We also have 'reach partners' who are working with very large numbers of people (e.g. Milan Design Week had over 400,000 attendees in 2018), we will work with the heads of 10 design weeks to develop new tools to help them engage with their audiences en-mass. We will use co-design to collaboratively design and test ways of enabling these new scales of engagement for our partners, giving them direct value during the project, and on-going value as new practices and resources becoming part of their organisational vocabulary.  Our approach to the co-design of tools is exemplified in a stream of work from the current Leapfrog project (2015-2018) We co-designed with 20 librarians to help make this transition to mixed-service teams and spaces a more positive experience. Being led by them, together we developed a range of tools to help new teams form and function effectively. In Scaling up Leapfrog, one could imagine a tool being adapted from the Librarians 'New team tools' to help people explore the contents of a design week collaboratively; this could be incorporated into the tickets created for the design week. Its very important to note though, our experience is that the real insights come from actually co-designing with partners, the real outcomes of the co-design process are likely to be unexpected and all the more innovative for that. The new practices, tools and resources that are produced through co-design with our project partners will also have relevance across a diverse range of organisations, sectors and contexts. All the tools produced by the project will be shared freely through the Leapfrog website (www.leapfrog.tools), building on a library of free, resources available (and used) worldwide.","Every element of this project seeks real-world impact that enhances public sector engagement practice. The proposed work with Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group (MBCCG) and Food Power will lead to new tools and resources, tested, improved and embedded within these organisations, aligning directly with their organisational priorities and ambitions. This will enable the voice of some of the most disadvantaged groups to contribute actively to developing policy and interventions that will affect them directly.  Work with the Victoria and Albert Museum and World Design Weeks Network (WDWN) will produce tools and resources for use by practitioners in national and international networks, reaching hundreds of thousands of people in use (over 800,000 through work with the V&A, over 1,000,000 through work with WDWN). This will have a significant cumulative impact for example helping young people have a more inspirational experience in an engagement programme at a museum. For the WDWN we will help organisations bring design alive for a multitude of people, this could be something that helps attendees for the large design weeks get to grips with the huge scale of design weeks in Milan or Eindhoven but also it could include resources to help emerging design weeks such as Detroit to find their own voice with their attendees and introduce them to design. These four central organisational collaborations form the proposed project and are the product of highly active, engaged involvement of these partners in the development of this proposal. The existing Leapfrog project has demonstrated the transformative potential of tool co-design for public and third sector engagement practice. Our evaluation of the current Leapfrog project (2015-2018) revealed persistent changes in practice for individuals engaged in co-design work, and for organisations collaborating with the project. For example, Lancashire County Council staff co-designed tools to support new team formation which have now become embedded in the organisation, available to all staff though internal procurement systems, integrated into training processes and an everyday element of practice within the Council. We anticipate similar benefits from the proposed activities for our partners, and have integrated activities to embed outcomes into all elements of project. Each stream of activity within this project will produce collections (toolboxes) of adaptable tools, available freely through the Leapfrog website (www.leapfrog.tools) for at least 10 years from the end of project funding. The tools will be promoted by events run by both Leapfrog project staff and independently our project partners. These tools will be downloaded and used by practitioners directly touched by project activities, by practitioners within the existing Leapfrog network, and by practitioners around the world unknown to the project today. We anticipate continued demand for the new tools the project will produce, adding to those who have visited the Leapfrog website to date (over 60,000) and downloaded tools (over 2,000). Each download and subsequent use of a Leapfrog tool has the potential to touch hundreds of people, amplifying the impact and reach of the project and the research that underpins it. The tools and resources will enable effective engagement practice with groups of 80-100 people in a single event, or helping practitioners link together multiple engagement events or activities, in a few cases at the scale of 100,000 people. This aligns with our partners' needs (exemplified by the intent of our project partner MBCCG to run preventative healthcare workshops with 300 teachers at a time), and represents a step change from the existing Leapfrog tools (generally suited to work with groups of 2-20 people). Based on extensive scoping work with partners, we and our partners have chosen the goal of seeing more than 1 million people benefit from the outcomes of this follow-on project by 2021.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS003819%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project aims to create an interactive online tool to enhance the viability of small maker enterprises in the form of an Interactive Viability Roadmap. This tool will contribute the future viability of small maker enterprises through a personalised, design-based approach that provides tailored strategies for product development, process improvement and promotion effectiveness. The tool will assist enterprises in making decisions about future strategies that are in line with their values and priorities and also with the principles of sustainability. All the strategies suggested to an individual enterprise will be based on a) information supplied by the enterprise and b) successful 'real world' examples. The data visualised by this tool will also provide regional economic development and policy advisory organizations, such as the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Craft, with aggregate information about the values and priorities of small maker enterprises so that economic and other forms of support, and policy development decisions, can be better aligned with their needs. In recent times, there has been renewed interest in the provenance of the products we consume. This ranges from the foods available in supermarkets to the ingredients of restaurant menus, and from local craft beers to handmade objects. The research base for this present project was tangible goods, but the concept can be extended to include other kinds of goods. Notwithstanding the renewed interest, however, the viability of enterprises that produce these kinds of goods is often precarious - as indicated by the UK's Radcliffe Red List of Endangered Crafts and, at the international level, UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) Programme, both of which aim to support these cultural practices and raise awareness of their importance and value. While the UK presently does not subscribe to the UNESCO ICH Programme, it has been enthusiastically embraced in China at the national, regional and municipal levels. We have also seen considerable work in this area in the USA. Hence, this is a global issue and the potential use and impact of the proposed Interactive Viability Roadmap is international. Evidence demonstrates that there is a need for better understanding of how small maker enterprises can contribute to a vibrant creative economy through effective support that is respectful of their values and often has deep cultural roots. This project addresses this issue in two ways. First, it allows individual enterprises to adopt new strategies that are aligned with their declared values and priorities and with sustainable principles. Second, it enables regional economic development and policy advisory organizations to ensure that support and policy take into account the values and priorities prevalent among small maker enterprise owners, to ensure appropriate provision. TradeCraft will generate benefits for enterprise owners and other stakeholders, including designers working in the field, Craft Council, Design Council, North West Craft Network, Heritage Crafts Association, and regional tourist organizations; regional economic development organizations such as Local Economic Partnerships; policy advisory groups such as the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Craft; and researchers working in this field. In addition, the work will be of interest to groups internationally, such as Craft-ACT, Australia, the International Folk Arts Museum, Santa Fe, and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing. The extent to which COVID-19 will have a long-term negative effect on the cultural industries and tourism is too early to say. However, whether planning for resumption or for entirely new ways of appreciating and ensuring the resilience of small maker enterprises, this Interactive Viability Roadmap will allow enterprises and economic development and policy advisory organizations to make better-informed decisions about appropriate strategies and support activities.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV008072%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The early-modern period was foundational for modern diplomacy. Yet it was an age of religious turmoil and increasing globalization. How did diplomatic actors overcome barriers of language, religion, and culture to interact with each other? How did they use non-verbal languages (art, rituals, and space)? These are the central problems addressed by the network. They also provide a key to engagment with current practice in two senses. First, modern diplomacy faces seemingly comparable issues: challenges such as the 'Arab Spring', and even Wikileaks, have questioned a view that diplomacy is grounded on a shared understanding of international relations, especially on what constitutes a state and who controls state information. Accordingly, what can we learn today from early-modern diplomats who faced similar challenges? Equally, what can scholars learn from the experiences of contemporary diplomats dealing with 'new' states (e.g. Iraq and Afghanistan) and with cross-cultural relations. Secondly, the interdisciplinary network will eschew narrowly political accounts of diplomacy. It will bring together established scholars and early-career researchers from history, modern languages, anthropology, art and architectural history, legal history, and international relations. It will also involve members of the heritage sector (e.g. English Heritage). Together, we will analyze the social and cultural processes that contribute to creating a global diplomatic community. These aims and objectives will be examined through four themes: Translating cultures How did peoples of different political and religious persuasions find common diplomatic ground? Our period was of critical importance in the history of cross-cultural relations - issues of enormous sensitivity today - as Europeans frequently engaged with 'others': Muslim, African and Asian powers, as well as competing confessions following the Reformation. Who were best qualified to bridge cultural and confessional boundaries - merchants, artists, scientists, translators? Symbolic languages We will assess the power of diplomatic rituals and symbols - did shared understandings emerge of how diplomats should be treated and how they should interact? What happened when rituals were challenged? Could rituals re-define the very notion of sovereignty? The non-textual languages of diplomacy included space and material culture. How did diplomats move through palaces and charged political spaces? What access did they have to each other and to sovereigns? How were diplomatic gifts and the exchange of art interpreted? The methodologies for studying diplomatic practice How can researchers from different disciplines and countries learn from each other and develop a robust methodological framework for the area of study? Ideas will be shared through a dedicated website and the outcomes disseminated through an edited volume. We aim to ensure that the network leads to future collaborative work beyond the life of the AHRC funding. Between the early-modern and modern worlds To what extent are current problems comparable to, or different from, those faced by early-modern diplomatic actors? What can early-modern scholars learn from current practitioners of diplomacy and vice-versa? Also, how can we re-interpret material culture through the study of early-modern diplomacy? The network's potential beneficiaries will include the academic sector, the FCO and the heritage sector. First, the network will serve as a unique international hub for various research projects that are currently taking place around Europe, encompassing established and early-career researchers. The FCO and the academic network will gain mutual insights into diplomatic practice through understanding the early-modern 'models' and their contemporary counterparts. The heritage sector will benefit by fresh interpretations of assets such as palaces and other items of material culture, forming potentials for future collaboration","Our network will be an interdisciplinary examination of how the early-modern world acquired shared 'languages' of diplomacy. These were articulated verbally and non-verbally, at the boundaries between state and non-state power. These issues are not only of academic importance, but also have powerful resonances with contemporary diplomatic problems and also with the interpretation of key heritage assets.  The network is projected to involve participants from the public and heritage sectors, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and English Heritage (EH), and we are in dialogue with the National Gallery. The network will furthermore be overseen by advisors from the FCO and EH. They will participate in workshops where appropriate, to provide keynote talks and critical commentaries on papers. They will also provide a means by which the network will identify areas for future collaborative work.  Central to the network is knowledge exchange, whereby encounters between academics and non-academics transform knowledge and practice for both. Just as academics will benefit from the stakeholders' knowledge and understanding, so stakeholders will benefit from the kinds of theoretical and methodological insights that academics bring to bear on the analysis of diplomatic practice. A clearer understanding of potential benefits can best be achieved through two examples: The FCO's participation will be mutually beneficial. Two network participants recently served as diplomats in Iraq and Afghanistan, and have extensive experience of dealing with new diplomatic actors from different religious and cultural traditions. As an official FCO historian, Keith Hamilton will provide expertise on modern diplomatic practice. We are in discussion also with a senior employee of the intelligence services, whom we hope will particpate in the FCO workshop, adding a dimension to our work on the nature of secrecy as an element of diplomatic communication. By examining the interplay between early-modern diplomacy and current practice, we aim to inform practicing diplomats about the social, cultural and political backdrop to modern diplomacy. Many key issues facing contemporary international politics have a considerable back-story. Why, for example, do we assume that only sovereign powers could engage in diplomacy? Who was qualified to act as a diplomat? Why was secrecy a sovereign prerogative? How should diplomacy operate amongst peoples with different religious or cultural frameworks? For early-modern scholars, FCO involvement will enable us to reflect more fully on the practical issues of diplomacy, and refine our questions for future research. The involvement of participants from EH with expertise in Historic Royal Palaces, together with the involvement of the Society of Court Studies, will inform us of how heritage assets, such as the Queen's House at Greenwich, Hampton Court, and Windsor Castle, were used as diplomatic spaces. These are key national resources that were re-shaped in the early-modern period to meet changing expectations of diplomatic practice. In turn, we hope that the network will identify ways of re-interpreting these assets today, for academic and wider public audiences. This might lead to fruitful partnerships with Historic Royal Palaces, and also with emerging projects on the continent, in particular the Palatium project in Belgium, and that at Versailles.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK005049%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Many people in society cannot benefit from the full value of cultural events if those events are not made available for them to access.  While we tend to think of barriers to access as being geographical (the production I wish to see isn't touring to my part of the country) or financial (I'd love to see that production if I could afford the ticket price), people who have sensory impairments - either because of disability or aging - may additionally experience barriers based on lack of support for their access needs. People who have difficulty hearing a theatre production may need captions. People who are Deaf may need sign interpretation. People who have vision impairments may need audio description. Just as people in rural communities can feel excluded from culture as 'it all happens in London, never here', people with access needs may feel that those who create culture do not care whether or not they are excluded from being able to participate in that culture.  Responding to this need, and prompted by legislation such as the Equality Act 2010, many cultural institutions have shown interest in making their cultural events accessible to the widest possible audience by making them inclusive.  The two organisations at the forefront of providing captioning and audio description services to theatres and live events in the UK are StageText (http://www.stagetext.org) and VocalEyes (http://www.vocaleyes.co.uk). While these organisations collect anecdotal evidence and survey evidence from people who attend their captioned and audio-described events, to date there has never been a rigorous and comprehensive assessment of the cultural value that making theatre accessible to their audiences generates. London Metropolitan University have partnered with StageText and VocalEyes to propose a research study that will seek to answer the following question - What is the cultural value of accessible theatre from the perspective of its two main stakeholder groups: - to the theatres (and businesses around them) that choose to provide captioned or audio-described performances, either to develop new audiences, or to bring former audiences back into the theatre; and - the audiences that those performances are aimed at (both those that choose to attend, and those who do not) We envisage this research providing rigorous evidence for the value of accessible theatrical performance, and of inclusive cultural activity, for a range of stakeholders; supporting the on-going work of organisations like StageText and VocalEyes, and potentially contributing to increased opportunities for hearing and visually impaired people to engage in mainstream culture. It will further contribute to underpinning inclusive practice in the UK; supporting the nation's beacon status in this area. It will also aim to support and contribute to the on-going embedding of inclusion as cultural practice.","Beneficiaries from this research include: Academia: o The rest of the Cultural Value project - providing an early case study to examine how well the other components identified in the Cultural Value Project describe the value that audiences for accessible theatre themselves assign to it, and uncover other possible components such as 'inclusion/exclusion' which might also be measured by other Cultural Value projects o Researchers in cultural practice & inclusive practice - these researchers will benefit from a key case study in the value of inclusive practice in the UK; supporting the nation's beacon status in this area. It will also aim to support and contribute to the on-going embedding of inclusion as cultural practice. Public Sector: o Arts grant-funding bodies such as Arts Council England, that part-fund StageText and VocalEyes at present - these bodies will benefit from our findings in understanding the cultural value return on investment of their funding, and be better able to decide and justify such funding in the future, thus Influencing Public Policy Business/Industry: o All theatres considering the value of accessible performances - theatres will benefit from our findings of the full value (both economic and beyond) of them choosing to dedicate some of their performances to be captioned or audio-described, to enable them to make Commercial decisions about the number of performances they make accessible. Charity: o Accessible Theatre suppliers (charities like StageText and VocalEyes) - these will benefit from our findings of the full value of the services they provide. This will help them to consider whether any Operational and Organisational Changes (such as concentrating resources on different aspects of their service) or Technological Changes (such as the understanding that sections of their audience might accept use of new and cheaper technologies - such as Google Glasses, for example - to reduce the cost or increase the value of their service) may optimise their work's value to their audiences. It may allow them to make better business cases for continued investment from existing funding sources, and potentially help them identify and attract new funding sources ( General public: o People who are hearing impaired, vision impaired, older or who have English as a Second Language (and the people they would choose to go to the theatre with) - these people will benefit from our findings which will enable the cultural value that they ascribe to accessible theatre to be more widely understood, enabling them to feel more included in society. This will also strengthen the business case for the provision of accessible theatre and inclusive cultural activity, potentially contributing to increased opportunities for hearing and visually impaired people to engage in mainstream culture, both of which may impact their Health and Well-being.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL00562X%2F1

Through creative practice workshops taking place in site-specific locations, the 'Unfiltered Coast' project will empower young people in these hard-to-reach communities. It will engage them with the effects of climate change, encourage them to consider their place in and influence on the evolving environment, and inspire them to engage in research that will help communicate and tackle climate change issues. 'Unfiltered Coast' will use the vast Kent coastline as a pilot, building towards national engagement as part of the project's legacy. Research Given the multi-disciplinary team, the project connects to various strands of research across the Arts and Humanities and Natural Sciences. This includes: 1) Representational strategies (audio-visual and literary) that support, strengthen or subvert understandings of places, including the inseparability of humans and their environs 2) Arts-led environmental activism, especially that which centres around blue and green space 3) Best practice community-engaged research that engages underserved audiences 4) Sustainable materials science, agriculture and energy research towards a circular economy  Aims 1) to encourage a connection between young people and their coastal locations, promoting a sense of responsibility towards its environs and ecology 2) to fuel an interest in climate research, inspiring young people via a range of methods that includes creative practice 3) to facilitate young people in their exploration and communication of climate challenges 4) to motivate young people to continue arts-led climate activism  Activities The project's activity centres on two creative practice 'walkshops' taking place along the Kent coast. These will be co-designed with a newly established youth-led Climate Change Working Group in the first month of the project. Self-audits will occur before and after the 'walkshops' as part of the engagement activity and our evaluation methods. Creative outputs emerging from the 'walkshops' will feed into an end-of-project exhibition to coincide with COP26. This will take place in a Ramsgate venue and tour to our partner organisation's venue in Canterbury. There will also be an end-of-project forum for the participating young people to engage with local policymakers. Data collected and the repository of outputs will be collated as a digital repository that will allow youth communities in other coastal parts of the UK to engage with and add to the data. Target Audience and Project Partner The project will involve young people aged 14-18 who live in coastal areas in Kent. As evidenced in the plan document, these coastal areas are especially vulnerable to climate change and related environmental factors as well as the resulting socio-economic implications. Coastal areas in Kent have a high number of young people considered hard to reach, with low cultural and science capital, poor access to higher education and limited opportunities to engage with climate action. We will reach these audiences via already existing youth networks, such as ART31, which is facilitated by our Project Partner - the Gulbenkian. A youth-led working group will be established early on in the project to ensure a bottom-up approach to the project throughout its timeline. Outcomes and Potential Impact The activity will serve to increase the sense of responsibility felt by young people to their coastal environs. It will increase confidence in the participants to take part in climate conversations. It will develop unique opportunities for young people to engage in art-led climate activism. It will bridge the gap between young people and researchers, aiming to break down preconceived notions about academic work. It has the potential to raise public awareness and influence policy.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW004860%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Certain binary oppositions remain prevalent in Western culture, and have done so since the Enlightenment. The production of civilised culture has and is often thought to rely upon the availability of significant leisure time, being long understood as the province of a privileged elite. Beauty and function, too, often sit in a rigid dichotomy, and aesthetic appreciation even now can be associated with the mind in opposition to the body. It is difficult to overstate the power of these historic dichotomies or the extent to which they still shape discussions about art and creativity throughout British and other national cultures. But it is also hard to overstate diasporic culture's capacity to dislodge their entrenched powers of assumption. In a wide variety of creative spheres, throughout the historic territories of the diaspora, the dichotomisation of leisure and art, and indeed of beauty and purpose, founder, growing powerless to explain the different, democratic, achievements of African peoples. Carnivals flower amid grinding violent poverty; Africa-tinged pit barbecue flourishes on the plantation; dances seem somehow to confound the ordeals of physical work; and in an array of other contexts expressivity asserts itself within an everyday life difficult to escape. The story of the blues that Langston Hughes once told, in other words, seems neither isolated nor unique. Invented in the field itself, as he speculated, and chiefly ""to relieve the monotony"" of difficult work, this functional lyricism instead only exemplified an alternative diasporic mode in which expressivity of all kinds happened amid racist toil and guarded against its multiple physical and psychological pains.  Alongside the blues among other lyrics of survival our new network explores some of the other key accomplishments of the diasporic everyday. It places Arthur France's establishment of the Leeds carnival at a time of extreme institutional racism into a wider diasporic pattern of active cultural resistance. It draws together US and UK food scholars to consider how slave cooks throughout the Black Atlantic interwove African food traditions into their everyday work, carving out new cultural and economic resources in a situation that remained sadistically hostile to African culture in the round. And it also welcomes back to Leeds Susan Kiguli, our East African alumnus, who has now won acclaim throughout the continent for her own explorations in oral poetry. Kiguli's involvement in our network promises to enrich our interdisciplinary reflections on the different, and differently indispensable, roles verse has performed among diverse diasporic communities uninterested in Eurocentric dichotomies of beauty and function.  Each of these everyday activities is fascinating in its own right, and through our roundtables our network will deepen understanding of them all. Above all we aim, however, to deepen our understanding of the diasporic philosophy which stands behind each such manifestation, unlocking the liberating, democratic investment in everyday creativity that they hold in common. Beauty, in the diasporic everyday, often manifests itself through function; basic imperatives of hunger and survival animate inspiration; and the permanence and perfection of the monument often seems less important than the moment of creativity itself. Yet as they thus synthesise this alternative cultural sensibility, our roundtables will also call attention to the ways in which it reflects outwards and onto those other vernacular or creative traditions, beyond the diaspora, which also confound agreed dichotomies of work and leisure and beauty and function. By the end of our programme, indeed, it will be clear that Hughes's ""Story of the Blues"" amongst other diasporic affirmations offer liberation to us all, confirming that all have access to art and creativity--that all culture, even, might belong to the everyday of us all.","The ultimate purpose of this network is to find a language that will recognise the creative lives of a constituency somewhat overlooked, even now, by the academy. Our roundtable discussions are academic occasions, and they will build towards a new academic statement or theorisation of the diasporic everyday. But nonacademic speakers will play a central role in this process, and the language which we will thus together pursue will strive towards a double affirmation. It will draw upon recent revisions of Lefebvre, and even Richard Hoggart's classic Leeds study The Uses of Literacy, in order to make an academic argument about the need to recognise the creativity of local everyday cultures, starting with those of the diaspora. And in doing so it will offer to those within the diaspora itself an overarching theory, developed in discussion, which reflects back to them what they might already know: that diasporic creativity has long occurred in everyday time, has often aimed at survival, and thus upsets leading European rhetorical claims about the meaning and function of culture.  The personnel as well as the intellectual framework of The Diasporic Everyday as such offers ample opportunities for new pathways to impact. The award of this AHRC grant would enable us both to develop this intellectual message of affirmation and then to carry it along the routes of dissemination made available through the involvement of our nonacademic members. The extended (three day) visits of our international scholars offer particular opportunities to plan public outreach programmes. When the US ethnomusicologist Shannon Dudley and the Trinidadian ethnographer Gabriel Hosein arrive for our roundtable on carnival, for example, we will plan a further offsite event, in discussion with Emily Marshall and Max Farrar, to share their expertise with north Leeds audiences involved in their own carnival. As Warnes has also, over the last two years, been collaborating with the organisers of the Leeds Indie Food festival, the visit of the brilliant US food scholar Psyche Williams-Forson raises the prospect of another public event on another history of everyday diasporic practice. At the end of both occasions questionnaires will ask audience members about their own relationship to creativity as well as their sense of the role of the university in the life of the city. Thus these events, although small in scale, will produce measurable and meaningful impacts that will in turn feed into our ongoing research.  Far bigger in scale is the public engagement event at the heart of the network: the performance of oral poetry from the East African poet Susan Kiguli alongside diasporic Leeds poets in the summer of 2017 on the new stage of the David Oluwale Memorial Garden. This event will also begin with a statement, from Warnes and Farrar, both on the Diasporic Everyday and DOMA's cultural ambitions for the city. To spread the word of our work on the diasporic everyday we are thus planning a public event of similar size and ambition to February 2016's Oluwale Now. As with Oluwale Now we will publicise this event via the established channels of our network and institution: through the offices of the David Oluwale Memorial Association, the Leeds West Indian Centre, and other organisations represented by our participants, and amongst the schools and colleges familiar to the School of English's increasingly successful access programmes. Questionnaires and social media will again provide a key source of measurable information about these events. As these will include questions not only about the oral poetry itself but also the diasporic everyday concept which frames it, the information we harvest from this event will feed back in and shape our plans for further public work as well as the orientation of our final publication. By these means The Diasporic Everyday will thus intensify and transform the community relationships that we have developed since Oluwale Now.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP007139%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This application is made under the Public Policy Call. It fulfils the principal aim of that scheme by bringing together arts and humanities researchers from a range of disciplines (history, Irish studies, social anthropology, politics, education, English literature and geography) to share their expertise with policy makers at devolved and local government level and stakeholders in the voluntary and non-governmental sectors to discuss how commemorations of the centenaries of the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme in Northern Ireland (NI) in 2016 can be facilitated to avoid heightening further inter-communal and ethnic tensions and to promote greater engagement with and understanding of the shared past. The principal objective of the application is to facilitate academics in contributing to the aims of the NI executive's strategy of May 2013 'Together Building a United Community' (TBAUC) which seeks to establish in NI:  'a united community, based on equality of opportunity, the desirability of good relations and reconciliation - one which is strengthened by its diversity, where cultural expression is celebrated and embraced and where everyone can live, learn, work and socialise together, free from prejudice, hate and intolerance.'  This strategy recognises the significance of the Irish 'decade of centenaries', running from c. 1912 to 1923:  'The decade we have just entered will include a number of potentially sensitive anniversaries which we cannot ignore within the context of this Strategy ... and the way in which these events are marked will also have a significant influence on our continued journey towards a united community.' The second objective is to share the body of knowledge and expertise of the network's academic members with each other and with public bodies in NI that will have a key role in over-seeing and organising events to mark these historic centenaries, including: - The Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) - The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) - Belfast City Council And policy and non-governmental organisations involved in improving cross-community and cross-border relations and promoting peace and reconciliation: - The Community Relations Council - Healing Through Remembering - Co-operation Ireland The final objective is to invite experts in the areas of commemorative practice, contested commemoration in international situations similar to NI and public engagement with history and commemoration through education to establish best practice guidelines which will assist those organising and managing commemorative events. The network will address three key issues: 1. The nature and purpose of commemoration. 2. Comparative contested commemorations in an Irish and an international context. 3. Shared engagement with a contested past through education and the shared use of public space for contested commemorations. The network will hold three workshops to address each of these issues and the findings will be disseminated in the form of: - policy briefing documents that will summarise the conclusions of each workshop - the presentation of findings to the DCAL committee of the NI Assembly - a seminar in the Knowledge Exchange Seminar Series organised by the Research and Information Service of the Assembly - summaries of the workshops posted on the 'Compromise After Conflict' blog hosted by the Institute for the Study of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen's University - an article in Shared Space, the journal of the Community Relations Council - the PGCE History curriculum in the University of Ulster. This is a unique opportunity to raise awareness of the breadth of expertise represented by the network and apply it to the benefit of public policy. It will also inform the academics' research through their own role in advising on the commemorative process.","Devolved government: The Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister is the most important department in the devolved government and has overall repsonsibility for implementing 'Together Building a United Community' and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) is the department most heavily involved with the decade of centenaries. It oversees a wide variety of public institutions whose activities will be centred around events relating to the Rising and the Somme in 2016, including National Museums Northern Ireland, Libraries NI, the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI), the Northern Ireland Arts Council and Northern Ireland Screen. DCAL's involvement in the network will act as a conduit for these organisations to relay the issues which concern them to the network for discussion at their workshops and conversely to disseminate the network's research outcomes to all of these bodies. The inter-disciplinary nature of the academic side of the network ensures that all of these groups will benefit from expertise relevant to their particular area of interest, e.g. English literature will be of most interest to the Arts Council and Libraries NI and History to PRONI and the museum sector. DCAL also works closely with the Republic of Ireland's Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the expertise it will have access to through this network will further benefit cross-border commemorative interaction and allow the Irish government to gain a greater insight into the unique dynamics surrounding contested historical commemoration in Northern Ireland.  Local authorities: All local authorities in Northern Ireland have a good relations officer and the GRO for the largest such authority, Belfast City Council (BCC), will be a member of the network representing GROs in the other councils, with whom she can liaise concerning the discussions and research outputs of the network. Among the principal activities of BCC relating to the decade of centenaries is the hosting of a range of public exhibitions in Belfast City Hall to reflect the key events of the previous century. The members of the network will provide valuable advice to those in BCC tasked with curating these displays. City Hall is one of the most significant and symbolic buildings in Belfast, and a touchstone for contested symbols since the decision to reduce the number of days on which the Union flag is flown there. Given the centrality of this site as a cross-community space, BCC is keen to ensure that its commemorative work is appropriate, sensitive and reflective of the shared past of the divided community that it serves. Third sector: The third aspect to the network comprises the voluntary sector and independent policy bodies. Healing Through Remembering and the Community Relations Council are two of the most influential organisations dealing with the legacy of past conflict within Northern Ireland. Along with the Heritage Lottery Fund, the CRC has taken a leading role in establishing principles to ensure ethical commemoration of the decade of centenaries. Co-operation Ireland brings a valuable cross-border (crossing geographical boundaries) perspective to the network, that will allow it to examine the wider island of Ireland significance of the contested commemorations. Co-operation Ireland's special focus on the youth is central to the network's desire to ensure the engagement of younger people with the historic commemorations, seen in the focus on the relationship between education and commemoration in the final workshop. Trainee teachers: Through McCully's involvement the network will impact upon students taking the only PGCE in History in NI and will consequently inform their teaching of the subject in schools. The inter- and multi-disciplinary approach will also enable them to approach the study of these events in a wider societal and civic context and outside of the strict confines of the school history curriculum.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL015498%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Until the twentieth century barkcloth was a vital material in the social, cultural and ritual lives of Pacific islanders. Barkcloth, or tapa, was widely used in tropical areas instead of weaving cloth on a loom and was used to create clothing, furnishings, carpeted pathways for royal weddings and funerals, and masks and garments for ritual and religious ceremonies. Sheets of the inner bark of trees and flowering plants were stripped and soaked to soften them, then beaten with wooden mallets to stretch the cloth and make it softer and stronger, before decorating it with painted designs. The production and use of barkcloth were disrupted by increasing western impact on the Pacific islands in the nineteenth century and in some areas missionaries completely suppressed its use. There is a continuous tradition of making barkcloth in some areas of the Pacific, but the skill has been lost in other islands, such as Hawai'i. Today the re-introduction or re-interpretation of barkcloth is an important aspect of cultural identity in these islands.  Barkcloth was of great interest to travellers from the west, and Pacific barkcloth objects in western museums are a significant legacy from eighteenth and nineteenth century explorers, scientists and colonists. There are many good collections in museums in the UK and around the world but there are still major gaps in our understanding of it as a material. This project will examine the development of barkcloth production in the Pacific in the nineteenth century. We want to investigate whether materials, techniques and designs originated from particular islands, how they were transmitted around the region and the effect of globalisation on this tradition. This is important both for our understanding of objects in museum collections and for contemporary barkcloth makers in the Pacific. The project will focus on three internationally important collections at The Hunterian, University of Glasgow and The Economic Botany Collection at Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, in the UK, and The National Museum of Natural History, part of the USA's Smithsonian Institution. We will research the provenance and history of objects in the collections and analyse their materials and manufacture. We will also carry out fieldwork in the Pacific islands, talking to barkcloth makers, growers and designers and experimenting with making barkcloth using different plants and beating techniques. We know that a variety of plants, including breadfruit, banyan and mamaki, were used to make barkcloth but it is often assumed that objects in western collections are made from the paper mulberry tree though in fact paper mulberry is not indigenous to the Pacific. However it is currently extremely difficult to identify barkcloth species because the fibres were badly damaged during production. The research will explore different identification techniques including the staining of sections, scanning-electron microscopy, protein analysis and DNA analysis. We aim to use some of these methods to identify the plant species in museum objects so that we have a better understanding of the plants used in different islands and how globalisation affected their use. An investigation of preservation and conservation techniques is an integral part of the project. Many barkcloth objects in museum collections are in poor condition; many pieces are very large and have been folded for storage but the cloth becomes brittle and inflexible with age and the folds become fixed. A programme of conservation treatment and improved storage will make the Hunterian and Kew artefacts accessible for current and future research. This will also improve our understanding of the physical properties of barkcloth; we will be looking for links between the objects' physical characteristics and degradation patterns and the plant species. This could result in different conservation treatments for objects depending on their fibre type or condition.","We envisage three main groups of beneficiaries in the professional and public arenas outside the academic community: 1. Conservation staff, both in museums and in commercial practice.  It is standard conservation practice to approach an object in light of knowledge about its composition and history. At present for barkcloth there is a lack of systematic knowledge about either; consequently each piece must be approached as a new project. The project's insights into barkcloth history, material identification and conservation practice represent both a major resource for conservators, and a baseline for further research by practicing conservators. The development of identification techniques and improved reference materials will inform the assessment of pieces in collections beyond those of the three participating museums. A greater understanding of physical characteristics, degradation pathways and condition indicators will aid identification, even for museums which do not have access to expensive analytical equipment. This has direct benefits for conservators and contributes to the outcomes for museum and gallery visitors, below.  2. Museum & gallery visitors. Because of its portability and ubiquity in eighteenth and nineteenth century Pacific societies many museums have significant numbers of Pacific barkcloths, often on display to the public, and they are currently a popular subject for special exhibitions. The project will share its findings both with specialist Pacific curators (who fall within our academic beneficiaries) but also with generalist curators with wide responsibilities - a group represented by the project participants at the Hunterian and Kew. It has often been noted that European museums have rich Pacific collections, but notably little on display. In reaching curators, we expect to see an increase in the quantity and quality of barkcloth interpretation (and an increase in the number of pieces on display), leading to a greater understanding of and interest in barkcloth - a key element of Pacific cultures - among museum visitors.  3. Contemporary makers and consumers of barkcloth in the Pacific. While the main project activities are scheduled for the northern hemisphere, we are keenly mindful of the source communities for museum specimens, and their strong interest in preserving or - more often - reviving barkcloth production in the Pacific. Although we cannot resolve all the difficulties facing makers, we can tackle three. First, the project database and the improved catalogues of the participating museums will be a simple-to-use and obvious starting point for makers and other artists seeking inspiration and understanding of how barkcloth traditions have evolved. At present it is hard to locate barkcloth in museum catalogues, as terminology varies, key information is missing, and images are missing or poor. We envisage easier electronic access also leading to more visits by makers to museum collections, a pattern already visible from other web resources at Kew and the Hunterian. Second, the project outcomes will make technical information widely available on the raw materials, tools and processes involved in barkcloth making, drawing on evidence from analysis of museum specimens, literature, and fieldwork. Unlocking this kind of information, through written resources or the dissemination event, will enable makers to make better informed choices about materials. Thirdly, we expect the project web site and other forms of dissemination to further raise the profile of barkcloth, leading to greater value being placed by society on contemporary makers and their work. We recognise that resources such as the website will likely inspire both makers - or makers-to-be - who seek to preserve and revive traditional barkcloths, and those who are seeking innovation or artistic experimentation. Both are desirable outcomes, in that the project will be supporting barkcloth manufacture as a living practice.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM00886X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              How did the major 20th century British sculptor, Barbara Hepworth, transform her artistic ideas into physical reality? How did she manipulate tools and processes to shape resistant matter, and how do they shape the artist in turn? And how did she work with technicians and artisans to turn her models into finished sculptures? These are fundamental questions to ask about the practice of Hepworth, or indeed any sculptor; yet they remain remarkably little explored. This project will seek to begin answering them by bringing together diverse sources of expertise to bear on the unique collection of the Hepworth Wakefield (THW), one of the north of England's most important museums of modern and contemporary art. While most other major holdings of Hepworth's work consist primarily of finished works, the core of THW's collection is the Hepworth Family Gift, is a unique archive of preparatory, technical and personal material. This includes plaster prototypes, bronze casts and carvings, prints and drawings, tools and materials, recipe books and notes/journals. There is further enriched by the loan of a significant portion of Hepworth's personal library.   At the moment, this remarkable collection remains poorly understood because of the lack of coordinated research into Hepworth's materials, techniques and processes. Much knowledge exists, but it is currently siloed among curators, conservators, practising artists, technical art historians, and academic art historians. The result is that THW finds it challenging to understand and present its rich holdings.   This research network will begin to address this situation by bringing together the diverse specialisms, skills and fields of expertise needed to understand Hepworth's material processes and their relation to her broader cultural aims and interests. It will enable academic art historians, curators at THW and elsewhere, practicing artists, conservators, technical art historians, technicians and engineers to pool and coordinate their methods and areas of expertise. In doing so they will generate substantial new knowledge and understanding of Hepworth's work. At the same time, they establish the basis for, and set the agenda for, further more targeted transdisciplinary research into Hepworth's material practice.  The network will have substantial impacts on the museum and gallery sector, on conservation practice and on the wide audience for Hepworth's work. It will feed directly into a forthcoming special retrospective - the largest Hepworth exhibition ever staged - and enable intervention into the permanent displays of Hepworth's work at THW. In doing so it will contribute to the cultural life and the wider regeneration of Wakefield.   No less significantly, it will also provide a model and foundation for collaborative research into material practice in the arts, essential if we are to gain a genuine grasp of the material aspects of artistic production. Art historians, while often enthusiastic participants in the 'material turn' in their discipline, have ironically tended to approach the material in highly theoretical ways. As a result, they have tended to prioritise phenomenological and socioeconomic approaches to materiality, while neglecting the immediate physical realities of artistic production. Practicing artists, technical art historians, engineers and art technicians are in direct contact with materials and processes. However, they are often remote from the questions that animate their art historical colleagues. Bringing together scholars and practitioners in the way envisaged by this project will bring these perspectives into dialogue, and show how detailed exploration of material evidence can transform our understanding of artistic production.","Both the subject matter of the Hepworth Research Network, the combination of academic, museum-based collaborators and practitioners, and the plans for dissemination of the Network's activities and findings will ensure that it has exceptionally wide impacts beyond the academy. The non-academic groups directly impacted by the research will include: - the Hepworth Wakefield (THW) - school groups and young visitors to THW and, in the longer term, other museums and galleries showing post-war British sculpture - adult visitors to THW, including artists and Barbara Hepworth enthusiasts  - conservators in museums and private practice - institutions with works by Hepworth in their collections - owners of modern sculpture, especially public sculpture - curators - public and private sector museums and galleries concerned with authentication of works and assessing their condition - residents of Wakefield and the surrounding area, including not only those directly visiting THW but benefiting from the wider economic impacts of THW, which the project will help support The Hepworth Research Network will play a direct role in shaping the priorities of THW regarding the care and display of its permanent collection, as well as informing temporary exhibitions, such as the forthcoming Hepworth retrospective in 2021 and its accompanying publication.  By facilitating new interpretative frameworks and the development of temporary interventions into the permanent display of Hepworth's work, especially the important but challenging group of maquettes and models in the Hepworth Family Gift, the Hepworth Research Network will enhance the engagement of audiences with it, particularly in connection to themes of materials and making. Using the experience of contemporary artists to understand the interaction with material and technological processes in creative practice will bring the engagement of audiences with historical artistic practices to life.   By connecting curators, technicians and conservators, the project will have direct impacts far beyond the academy. It will assist in the identification and dissemination of best practice in the preventive and remedial conservation of Hepworth sculptures, not only to ensure that her sculptures are better cared for and presented in both public and private collections, but that works by her contemporaries are also better treated and appreciated.  By enhancing the public programmes of THW, the project will also contribute to the wider regeneration of the Wakefield area, one of England's 20% most deprived council areas.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV000993%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The AHRC funded Laser Enhanced Biotechnology for Textile Design (LEBIOTEX, Grant Ref: AH/J002666/1, 30 June 2012 to 29 June 2015) project resulted in the realisation of a method for dyeing and patterning textile surfaces in one step using CO2 laser technology. This technique is termed 'peri-dyeing' and involves applying dye locally to the surface of a textile substrate followed by laser irradiation. The dye diffusion and reaction takes place at the point of laser interaction. The novel technique offers digital design opportunities allowing multi-tonal, multi-colour, photographic and precise linear details with high levels of customisation on both natural and synthetic fibre fabrics (e.g. wool, polyester, nylon). Customised colouration on both fabric and assembled garments, including across seams, enables remote, on-demand, non-contact processing of finished products and offers the potential for fixation of chemicals other than dye (e.g. fire retardants, anti-bacterial) to achieve localised surface modification and functionality. The technique has the potential to make significant savings in energy, water and dye use in comparison with conventional textile colouration and patterning processes. The peri-dyeing process suggests alternative manufacturing and distribution flows that may allow for a more precise, responsive approach to market demands potentially reducing waste stock and enabling a more efficient distribution of goods.    The aim of the proposed follow-on project is to identify and pursue new opportunities to implement and exploit the peri-dyeing technique within different textile sectors, focusing on the potential to apply peri-dyeing directly to garments, fashion and upholstery fabrics. This will enable localised and on-demand surface colouration, three-dimensional patterning and surface modification for both aesthetic appearance and functionality, alongside environmental and cost benefits. The emphasis on working directly with textile industry partners in four different sectors will significantly enhance the impact of the recent LEBIOTEX research.","By focusing on both economic and sustainability advantages from the application of peri-dyeing within four textile market sectors, this project initiates new opportunities for impact from the LEBIOTEX project.  The proposed follow-on project will explore the previously unforeseen possibility of applying techniques directly to product blanks and pattern pieces rather than large quantities of fabric prior to garment construction. It pursues the idea that the technique could provide a 're-design' of current models of design and manufacturing for dyeing and surface patterning within the sector. It has the potential to contribute to sustainable innovation by reducing water, chemical and energy use and provide a system that facilitates a responsive on-demand approach further reducing waste in off-cuts and over production.  Through the creation of prototypes, the project will facilitate creative engagement and knowledge exchange between the project team and the project partners, two of whom were not involved in the original LEBIOTEX project. The project will engage new audiences as the proposed activities conducted with each partner will be extended to involve designers, product developers and supply chain managers.  Each of the project partners will benefit from an increased understanding of how the new techniques could be implemented within their current design, manufacturing and supply chain systems and how this implementation could result in environmental advantages and new product design opportunities. This will offer competitive advantage.  The project will benefit from the opportunity to implement and evidence research impact and to explore the potential for commercialisation and acquire an increased understanding of issues around innovation and knowledge transfer.  Dissemination of the work is integral to the project. The outcomes and outputs of the project will be added to the online gallery and website of the LEBIOTEX project (www.dmu.ac.uk/laserenzymetextiles). When appropriate, press releases (DMU, LU and project partners) will be made alongside the publication of industry trade articles (e.g. Draper), conference presentations (e.g. AUTEX, Textile Institute) and journal publications (e.g. Journal of Textile Design Research and Practice).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP014925%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project centres on a one-off piece of technology from the 1830s/40s: the Eureka Latin Verse Machine. This device, built to 'compose' in random sequence lines of poetry (each one arranged in Latin hexameters), was conceived and constructed by a Somerset inventor named John Clark. The 'programme' on which Clark's machine works, which had been in existence for over a hundred years when he decided to 'automate' it, consists of a table of letters so arranged that when a person selects from among them following a particular numerical sequence he or she is able to 'manufacture' a line of poetry that is at once 'correct' in terms of its metre, grammar and sense. The Eureka uses a system of wooden staves, metal wires and revolving drums that are activated when the machine is wound up by hand. Once one line of poetry is composed it appears in windows on the machine's front; the line is then scrambled and another appears in its place, ostensibly in random order, this process continuing until the machine runs out of motive power. The project is interested in uncovering and documenting the competencies, methodologies and skill sets needed for the construction of such a device, as well as the extent to which the convergence of these specialisms can be put to productive use in the current day to inform restoration projects relating to Britain's technological heritage. To that end, the project assembles experts from the key disciplines whose knowledge feeds into the working of the Eureka: a specialist in nineteenth-century versification (principal investigator); an expert in Classical studies of the Victorian period; a historian of nineteenth-century mathematics; a mathematician and computer scientist (co-investigator); engineering specialists working at Exeter's Centre for Additive Layer Manufacture (CALM); two conservators; and the archivist for the Alfred Gillett Trust (AGT), which owns the Eureka. This team of experts, co-ordinated by the principal and co-investigator, with other named experts advising on a sub-contractual basis to keep costs to a minimum, will assess the historical object and documents obtaining immediately and peripherally to it (e.g., notes on its construction and on Victorian prosody/programming/mathematics/Classics more generally) with a view to (1) understanding the Eureka's operation, (2) conserving the device itself and (3) returning it (where feasible) to a functional state. Given its age and uniqueness, however, the project will also (4) produce both a virtual and actual replica--the former using up-to-date computer programming, and the latter the procedures of 3-D printing in Exeter's CALM lab--that will allow for display and hands-on operation. A related outcome is the documenting of collaborative methods and manufacturing techniques for potential application in other restoration projects. The knowledge we gain about the use of 3-D printing for the construction of objects relating to the history of science will have transferable use across the museums and heritage sector, providing a model for best practice, as well as a detailed construction template. Once the core work supported by the grant has been accomplished, we envisage an exhibition of the machine, alongside its replicas and related examples of Victorian 'computing' technology, bringing the Eureka, which was famously exhibited in 1845, back to public view. Roughly 170 years later, a new generation can appreciate the collaboration of science and culture, with a fuller awareness of the array of techniques that came together--both then and now--to make possible computer-generated poetry. For this venture, which is likely to fall beyond the immediate timeframe of the grant, we have begun dialogue with the Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM) in Exeter (which already maintains a collection of artefacts relating to Babbage's 'Difference Engine'), as well museums in Somerset (where the Euerka was originally built) and the Science Museum in London.","The project generates both academic and economic and societal impact--through its end products but also through its methods and processes, which will be carefully documented with a view to sharing with scholars, members of the heritage sector and the general public. Impact generation can be divided into four main areas: public exhibition and engagement, schools, undergraduates and the heritage and private sectors.  Public exhibition appeals to the general public with a focus on science and technology in its historical and cultural context. The specific iterations of the Eureka realized through the project provide a focus for exploration of the foundations of computational poetry and language. Furthermore, the technologies involved (e.g., 3D printing and artificial intelligence) have captured the public imagination. Exhibition will fall outside the immediate timeframe of the grant, but we have begun dialogue with, in addition to the Alfred Gillett Trust (current proprietors of the machine), museums in Devon, Somerset and London. Ultimately, exhibition plans will depend on conservation outcomes, and for these reasons we have not factored exhibition plans into the application's Timetable or Resources. Public engagement designates other ways of reaching a general audience. Given the wide appeal of the cultural and technical topics related to the Eureka, the project will seek to engage popular scientific and history magazines (e.g., New Scientist) and television programmes. Further, to secure the wider impact of the materials we produce, the project website will make available videos, case files, and software, enabling the public to co-create new material based on the project. The project will invite local schools to view aspects of the restoration and replica construction. Exeter's Computer Science department already runs a series of workshops for schools, which will be extended to include ideas of randomness, language and poetry generation. We will work with the newly-founded Exeter Mathematics School, a sixth-form specialist mathematics school, which has strong links with the University of Exeter, but also with students taking English and Latin at GCSE and Royal Institution mathematics classes held at the university. In addition, the project will engage directly with the Computing at School (CAS) initiative, which seeks to promote and support computer science education in light of the introduction of the new ICT curriculum. Following previous conferences hosted by Exeter, we will co-ordinate another conference towards the end of the project that focuses on John Clark, the Eureka machine, language and chatbots. Videos from a preliminary examination of the Eureka are already used by the CI in programming courses reaching over 200 undergraduates a year, and the PI presents prosodical documents relating to the Eureka in undergraduate poetry options. The project will also engage a group of undergraduate Engineering students in a final-year project and a final-year Computer Science student in making a 3D virtual simulation. Of particular relevance to both academic and extra-academic beneficiaries are the methods underpinning the restoration and replication of the Eureka using additive layer manufacturing. The principal beneficiary here will be the heritage sector, particularly in relation to preservation, display and interpretation of historical artefacts since the industrial revolution. We will therefore pursue ways of disseminating the results of our study through professional trade bodies such as the Museum Association and the Institute for Conservation and publications such as Museum Practice. The working methods and techniques may be even more widely applicable, and the project thus presents a prototypical case study of the use of 3D printing for the replication of historical materials, whether by a publically funded museum or private corporation (e.g., a manufacturer of scientific instruments).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM003086%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Sharing a colonial past under British rule and separated by regional tensions since 1948, South Asian nations have all been equally exposed to Hindi cinema for decades. Within the region, Hindi cinema made in India has been simultaneously a shared medium and a modern form of cultural colonisation. Video online distribution (VOD) is now beginning to destabilise this film industrial configuration, enabling the global circulation of films from South Asian countries that, until recently, were confined to the domestic market.  Tension between South Asian countries mark both relations within the South Asian diaspora in Britain and public attitudes towards South Asian diasporans. Today, however, VOD makes it possible for Indian audiences to watch, for instance, Pakistani or Bangladeshi films, even if movement of people and goods between the two countries, and inter-diasporan relations, are at best difficult. But this new form of cultural exchange is entirely mediated by video online distribution companies (VODs) and their commercial interests. The purpose of this network is to enable filmmakers and scholars from South Asia to begin to explore the possibilities of regional dialogue offered by this is new cinematic ground. Two features characterise the growth of VODs like Netflix, Amazon, Hotstar, Iflix or Viu: the expansion of their geographic reach and their diversification into local content production. VODs have adopted the commissioning and production of films or series in local languages with local crews as a market penetration strategy. VODs' claim is that this enables filmmakers marginalised within the domestic industry to gain international exposure. The general assumption is that this, in turn, helps challenge received ideas about local cultures and identities. In reality research is at too early a stage to substantiate either. Most research on VOD is sponsored by the companies or their investors. More objective studies have been undertaken by public advisory agencies in the Global North, which are, however, of little practical use when applied to national cinemas in South Asia. Existing academic research examines VOD as an industrial complex through a political economy of the media approach within which films, their aesthetics and cultural specificity are marginal concerns. This type of research documents the extent to which VODs define the limits within which independent filmmakers work. What is missing is research on how filmmakers move within those limits and how this, in turn, shapes the films they make. These conditions demarcate independent cinema - its content and aesthetics - and, with it, also our imaginings of local identities. By bringing together filmmakers from different South Asian countries and scholars, and combining theoretical approaches with the experience of creative industry professionals, this network will enable research that explores how VODs' operation (distribution, commissioning and production) is shaping ideas of South Asian identity and regional relations. It will be the first network to research VODs' operation from this methodological and geographic perspective. Networking will also stimulate transnational dialogue among nationals who share common historical and cultural influences but have entertained conflictual political relations. Third, networking will enable us to address questions of content, aesthetics and representation from different professional windows, implementing an interdisciplinary, comparative methodology that, based on localised angles, will be of relevance to the study of VOD's impact on independent cinema also in other regions.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW006464%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              From its beginnings, cinema has developed in close interaction and, to a certain extent, rivalry with its sibling arts literature, the theatre, painting, dance, architecture and photography. Whilst, over the past two decades, scholars have become increasingly interested in the relations between film and the other arts, to date research efforts have concentrated mainly on specific interfaces notably between film and painting and film and literature. This network aims to offer a stimulus for new directions in the study of cinematic intermediality (that is, the interaction and crossing-over between cinema and the other arts), opening up new areas of research and new creative pathways. It intends to foster dialogue and exchange between researchers from different Humanities disciplines (Film and Media Studies, Media Arts and Design, History of Art, Theatre and Performance, Modern Languages) and practitioners through a series of four workshops and related knowledge exchange/ impact events. The workshops will examine the manifold ways in which the cinema references, incorporates and reframes other artistic practices, initiating fusions and cross-overs between different media. Particular emphasis will be given to the permeability between cinema and the other arts in avant-garde and experimental practice and its legacy in mainstream film, as well as to the role of technology in forging new connections between film and the other arts.  The border-crossings between cinema and the other arts that are at the centre of this project allow us to revisit questions regarding the specificity of the cinematic medium, questions that are all the more pressing in our digital, 'post-media' age. By engaging researchers and practitioners in dialogue around these questions the network seeks to broaden the traditional horizon of film studies, fostering a better understanding of the ways in which cinema is shaped by the other arts and providing a platform for reflecting on film's status as an 'impure' medium where different art forms intersect and communicate. Inserting itself into the burgeoning field of intermediality studies, which is stimulating thinking across disciplines, the project will make a timely intervention in a more general debate about the relationship and cross-fertilisation between different art forms. The four workshops will experiment with novel forms of presentation and exchange by inviting a mixture of formats (combination of short position papers and exploratory talks, round table discussions, discussion groups based on papers submitted prior to the workshops, illustrated presentations by practitioners). They are accompanied by a series of knowledge exchange / impact events which will place emphasis on curatorial outputs and engage a wider public in the network's research base. The findings of the project will be beneficial to researchers interested in the relations between film and the other arts working in a broad range of Humanities disciplines. The network involves three external partners, the newly opened LUX Scotland, Filmhouse Edinburgh, and Aberystwyth Arts Centre, opening up possibilities for future collaborations between the first two institutions and allowing Filmhouse and the Aberystwyth Arts Centre to extend their programming of non-mainstream work.","The project will achieve a wider impact through engaging practitioners, cultural organisations and members of the public in the research of the network. Its main non-academic beneficiaries are the practitioners involved in the project, the three external partners (Aberystwyth Arts Centre, Filmhouse Edinburgh and LUX), and the wider public engaged in the events that accompany the four workshops.  The key benefits are: - new creative stimuli and networking opportunities for the practitioners through exchange with academics and other practitioners - new programming opportunities, access to new audiences, new collaborations for the three external partners:  the events accompanying workshops 1 (screening of films by Mara Mattuschka and Chris Haring based on live theatrical performances) and 3 (festival of intermedial avant-garde films), held in collaboration with the Aberystwyth Arts Centre and Filmhouse Cinema Edinburgh, will allow these two institutions to extend their programming of non mainstream cinema, incorporating intermedial films into their programming. This broadening of their activities will give them access to new audiences and is likely to have an economic impact in the immediate and longer term. The involvement of LUX, the major distributor of artists' moving image in the UK, in the latter event will encourage future collaborations between the newly opened LUX Scotland and Edinburgh-based organisations, since LUX activities are so far limited to Glasgow and Dundee. LUX Scotland's mission statement includes developing 'new touring and screening initiatives in collaboration with arts venues across Scotland [...] and new public research resources' (http://luxscotland.org.uk/mission/). The network lays the foundations for fulfilling these aims both through its academic research and its public engagement activities. It will feed into and complement LUX's emphasis on learning by establishing a new collaborative research resource on intermediality in avant-garde film that will be accessible through the LUX website.  - enhancement of knowledge and cultural enrichment for a wider public: the public events accompanying the four workshops will engage a diverse audience in the network's research base, allowing them to reflect on film's relationship with the other arts through film screenings, illustrated talks by practitioners, and audience debates led by members of the network. Together these various events will increase public awareness of the cross-fertilisation between film and other artistic practices and of the inherently 'impure' nature of the filmic medium.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN001907%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Widely regarded as a central concept to understanding the contemporary urban form, the idea of the global city is certainly here to stay. The aim of this research network is to investigate how digging deeper into the history of the phenomenon can improve our understanding of its present-day manifestations. Global city scholars identify their subjects by their character as economic giants, international gateways, political and cultural hubs, and sites of great wealth inequalities. Yet, many scholars who research the colonial city in the first age of European expansion would also draw on such categories to describe their subjects of investigation. How does exploring these shared characteristics enrich our understanding of the global urban process over time? How much of this apparent similarity can be sustained after closer investigation? How might it impact the thinking of policy-makers and social scientists when we realize that the problems of today's global cities were also the problems of the first globalized metropolises 250 years ago? These are just some of the questions that this research network seeks to answer by bringing historians into the conversation about the global city. Since the late twentieth century, the idea of the global city has become central to the way in which social scientists and policy-makers approach our contemporary cities and their role in the process of globalization. Urban scholars have contributed to this focus by identifying important ways in which global forces and the city have come together to shape both the modern urban condition and the nature of globalization itself. Thus, whether one considers patterns of financial investment, the emergence of new urban hierarchies, shifts in the urban spatial form, or transformations in the sociopolitical make-up of cities, it has become well-understood that these local realities and broader global exchanges are intricately connected. Historians of the urban past, however, have remained absent from this discussion. While their work has approached the city as a focal point from which to explore global exchanges in the medieval, early modern, and nineteenth century world, it often remains tied to the specificities of a location, shying away from discussions of the broader phenomenon of globalization. Understanding cities of the past as global cities, with a core role in the long history of globalization, nevertheless has the potential to enrich current discussions of the character and implications of globalization. Thus, the chief goal of this network is to stimulate discussion amongst historians, and between historians and other social scientists, to reach a better understanding of the global city across time as well as space. Historians have embraced the concept of globalization with recent inquiries into the networks of people, knowledge, trade, and culture that circulated the world from the medieval era onwards. Yet, urban scholars at work on such themes mostly fail to make connections beyond the limits of their chosen empire or region. This research network will also begin the task of putting ""urban"" back into the global process before the modern era by running four workshops on the pre-modern city in global context. The first three meetings will focus on the main areas of inquiry commonly pursued by urban studies specialists. These workshops will concentrate on space, the economic and political structures of urban life, and the character of the urban population. The meetings will encourage debate about how the main characteristics of the global city might be applied in specific historical contexts but they will also seek to identify broader trends and patterns across early modern empires. The final workshop will then be focused on identifying how historicizing the global city influences our understanding of its form, function, and problems in a contemporary context.","The project is designed to reach groups of people outside of the academy, specifically those involved in public policy and the general public. Public Lecture: The third workshop will be accompanied by a public lecture. Taking place in central London, the talk will be aimed at a general audience and will include a question and answer session. Focusing on London in comparative context the lecture will address how the idea of the global city can help us to understand a city's past, present and future. Introducing a broader audience to intersections between cities and globalization, the talk will convey the key aims of the network to the general public. The event will be publicized through a variety of channels that reach beyond the academic community and the network participants, including the Institute for Historical Research, the Museum of London, and the Centre for Metropolitan History Policymakers: The workshops will include sociologists, urban planners, and geographers with policy-making experience and ongoing links with central government. These participants will be critical to the process of knowledge exchange between historians and policy-makers. A number of individuals who will contribute to the workshops are also part of larger research clusters involved with policy. These groups have a strong web presence (Global and World Cities (GAWC) hosted by Loughborough University, for example) and working papers posted on these sites will broadcast the activities and findings of this network beyond its immediate participants. Blog and Website: The PI will maintain a blog of the network's activities and discussions, also using the site to publicize events and post calls for papers for the individual workshops. Linking the blog to other websites focusing on urban history and policy - GAWC, the Centre for Urban History at Leicester University, the Centre for Metropolitan History at the Institute of Historical Research, the Museum of the City at Portland State University, H-Urban - will raise its profile beyond the limits of the directly involved academic community. Furthermore, the blog will provide an accessible commentary on the project and will be fully linked to social media such as the St Andrews History blog and Facebook page. The blog will be edited with a broad audience in mind, so as to appeal not just to historians but also to interested policy-makers and the general public.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL012995%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project seeks to raise public awareness of the importance of healthy sleeping habits for physical and mental wellbeing by creative recreation of early modern sleeping practices - a period that has been termed a 'golden age' of sleep quality. This ambition will be achieved through a year-long collaboration with the National Trust's Tudor house Little Moreton Hall, which recreates the routines of Tudor daily life for its users. Working with Little Moreton Hall's team (including Costumed Interpreters; educational team; gardening team; staff and volunteers) and with local artists, filmmakers, social enterprises, mental healthcare providers and service users, and school groups across the northwest, the project will deliver a programme of costumed re-enactments of bedtime habits and sleep-management techniques, talks, demonstrations, hands-on activities, workshops, videos, artworks, public events and educational materials at Little Moreton Hall and across the northwest based on early modern sleeping habits and their relationship to historic healthcare practices. The programme will encourage a wide range of public audiences to place greater value on the quality of their sleep, and educate them about how to optimise their sleep quality. This initiative responds to a clearly defined need to combat the sleep deprivation 'crisis' that is endemic to globalised 24/7 societies, which damages economic growth and results in long-term physical and mental health problems. This project has emerged from five years of research visits and collaborative activities with the National Trust, whose collections have been pivotal to the PI's published work on sleep. Her book, 'Sleep in Early Modern England' (Yale University Press, 2016) is the first major historical study of sleeping practices. The book establishes the distinctiveness of early modern sleep culture and defines a critical relationship between sleep's cultural value and its quality. These key conclusions form the core of the creative activities proposed, which will establish the critical voice of historians in sleep's modern knowledge economy, alongside those working in the fields of medicine and biological sciences.  The sleep-themed programme of activities will represent a major innovation in interpretation approaches by the National Trust, whose future policies and working practices will directly benefit from the project. The project will build the capacity of staff and volunteers at Little Moreton Hall, and NT Tudor properties in the northwest (including Baddesley Clinton and Tudor Merchants House), by training them in a cutting edge aspect of social history, thereby enabling them to deliver innovative historically-informed events for their users, to expand and deepen the engagement of their existing audiences, and to increase the revenues of the heritage industry in a long-term perspective. This partnership will build new connections between the academic community, the heritage and creative industries, mental healthcare providers and users, and the educational sector across the northwest, creating new avenues for dissemination and new opportunities to establish the role of the humanities in responding to socio-economic challenges.","The 'How we used to sleep' initiative calls for a recalibration of the balance between sleep's biological drivers, which lie at the heart of medical and scientific analyses, and its cultural and environmental dimensions. This project will demonstrate that the way people think about sleep, and how they manage it, have a critical effect on sleep quality. This core principle will be creatively communicated to a wide range of non-academic audiences, which include the heritage sector, mental healthcare providers and service users, school and community groups in the northwest region, and the general public. The project's chief beneficiary is the National Trust's Little Moreton Hall, whose visitor base and socio-economic impact will be significantly extended. The creative programme of events will deepen users' emotional engagement with LMH by focusing on sleep: a universal aspect of human experience. LMH's profile within the NT organisation will also be enhanced as the project will be used as a case study to highlight the added value that cutting-edge historical research can bring to the heritage sector. LMH's team of staff and volunteers will also be trained in core aspects of sleep's history, building their capacity to enrich visitor enjoyment, expand their user communities, and to deliver sleep-themed activities beyond the project's lifespan. The project will encourage public users of LMH, and the National Trust more broadly, to understand the role that healthy sleep plays in securing physical and mental health. Users will be introduced to historical strategies to manage their sleep on a daily basis and encouraged to incorporate them within their daily routines. In so doing, the project supports the work of professional healthcare providers, including the Department of Health and Public Health England, for whom preventative healthcare practices are a key priority. Mental healthcare providers and service users in Cheshire will benefit directly from the project's insights and creative approach through a carefully tailored programme of engagement activities. This project will provide a unique case study of collaboration between the heritage industry and the academic community by placing historic sleeping practices at its centre. The project's results will be shared across the NT organisation as a model of good practice, thus contributing to policy in the heritage industry and establishing the critical role of historical research in facilitating heritage organisations to engage and expand their public audiences in creative new ways. Additional beneficiaries of the project include the primary and secondary education sectors, whose curricula will be enriched by pioneering historical research. Local artists, social enterprises, and filmmakers will also play a key role in the design and delivery of project activities, which will enable them to expose them to new partners in the academic community and heritage industry.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP00850X%2F1

This is a wide-spread problem in historic university and cathedral libraries and many National Trust properties. A good example from the National Trust is Wimpole Hall with a fully catalogued book collection which however is inaccessible to visitors of the property. This project aims to make such library collections available to the public through Augmented Reality technology, which will allow browsing the books on-site, through a mobile device, without removing the books from the shelves. This will mean that while eliminating any risks of damage, the visitors' experience in the historic property extends to library collections. The project brings together experts on augmented reality and experts on the history of the book to produce a pilot system for a small number of books in Wimpole Hall. It involves testing the technology for identifying individual volumes by hovering a mobile phone camera in front of a shelf. It also involves the development of relevant content for this group of books which will be overlaid in front of the live camera feed. We will develop this system and then test it on-site at Wimpole Hall with participants from the public visiting the house. Key partners: Ligatus, University of the Arts London; Museotechniki; National Trust. Key stakeholders: Institute of English Studies, University of London; University of Uppsala Library; Bodleian Library, Oxford University; John Rylands Library, University of Manchester; Salisbury Cathedral; Christchurch College, Oxford.","One of the aims of the project is to engage with stakeholders in order to raise awareness of the project output. We have identified stakeholders for every aspect of the project and the level of engagement that would be of interest to them. In general we have divided the stakeholders into: - Public / visitors of historic houses, whose experience will be enhanced and their knowledge extended by having access to rich material of the books in historic libraries, - Professionals / content providers, such as cataloguers and conservators who will be able to share their records and knowledge with the public thus increasing the impact of their work, - Heritage managers, such as National Trust property and collection managers who will become aware of a new technology that can enhance visitor experience of their collections. The project focus will be the deployment of the system in a National Trust property during the Easter holidays to maximise public impact. A number of meetings with stakeholders will also take place to demonstrate the functionality of the system. We will invest resources in these stakeholder meetings in order to form new partnerships which will allow us to follow up this pilot with a project of an extensive scope.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR010102%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project addresses the pertinent issues that have emerged in the massive growth and uptake of machinima, building on previous research into digital creative practice of performance-based media reported in the literature. It will engage key stakeholders from the breadth of creative and cultural industries, as well as the community of machinima practice, through the research design using traditional face-to-face and online techniques including within virtual environments. The range of opinion proposed for inclusion in this project is a key aspect of its contribution to understanding the impact of machinima, which has not previously been investigated. This research will therefore provide an important 'state of the art' dataset and point of reference for future researchers, as well as insight into the immediate and future ways that machinima is impacting on the shifts in our cultural values, particularly towards a visual culture that cannot be addressed through evaluation of social media alone. Machinima is the making of original content using 3D computer games engines and gameplay recorded in real time. Machinima creators ('machinimators') now draw on a multiplicity of computer video games but this type of co-created and participatory content was originally popularised by the growth in fantasy and simulated role-play environments such as World of Warcraft, Halo, Grand Theft Auto and The Sims. It originates from the 'demoscene' whereby computer 'geeks' promote the technical capabilities of computers through demonstrations of gameplay. The first machinima film was released in 1996 and since then machinimators have created and distributed thousands of fan-vids, parodies, satires, reenactments and original content through online fora in an increasingly complex ecology of technologies and new media. Recently, Machinima.com listed on the US stock market based on an impressive record of growth - more than 2.5 billion downloads of user-generated machinima films through its various online channels and 45 million unique monthly users. Content is now included in digital arts festivals and galleries around the world: machinima is inherently a convergence of technology, digital social practice and culture. Importantly, it has been described as 'the visual cultural phenomenon of the 21st century' (Greenaway, 2010).  Its growth in popularity has impacted games developers significantly because it challenges the ways in which they view their intellectual property and the role of their customers (games players) in the creation of commercial value, effectively testing the boundaries between authorship and ownership. In turn, this is resulting in shifts in thinking about the format and framing of end-user license agreements. More recently, as a main search facility for online digital creative content, the stability and growth of the community using Machinima.com is considered to be a health indicator of media platforms such as YouTube (much user-generated content posted to this site is machinima and computer gameplay recordings).  Despite this impressive growth record, particularly for the UK's digital cultural scene, it remains a relatively under-researched and poorly understood genre of participatory new media (Lowood & Nitsche, 2011). Within media studies, for example, it is described as a convergence culture, produced by 'digital natives' as a form of user-generated content that is superficially consumed in a purely online experience. Within computer gaming studies, it is considered to undermine the demand for animation artists skills, being seen as 'hacking and modding' content. These views fail to recognise the role of emergent creative and computing skillsets, or the ways in which the creative and cultural industries are recognising their value.","This project will have impact on a range of academic disciplines such as media studies, digital arts and creative technologies. It will contribute to the worldwide research community by enhancing knowledge of creative skillsets for digital visual culture, demonstrating a breadth of values and further highlighting areas of potential application, and aspects that require in depth, cross-cultural and transdisciplinary analysis. It will be of interest to cultural and digital creative arts industries who wish to develop evidence based policies from insight into creative practice, evolving skillsets, ways and means of interacting with digital creative content, development, emergence and evolution of on and offline communities of practice in digital visual culture. It will provide information for a general business community that wishes to learn about digital visual culture, its uses and applications. Finally, it will provide information for amateur and professional digital artists and content developers who wish to learn more about a participative new media format and the technologies employed in the sector. Impacts include - Providing an overview of the different types of machinima creative endeavours so that the values associated with different genres may be explored by stakeholders, enabling creative and cultural industries to engage with machinimators through mediated exchange during the project and beyond by encouraging them to consider how they may engage audiences to broaden the awareness of digital visual culture;  Providing a means for creative and cultural industries to evaluate a significant new media user-generated content format by enabling them to assess machinima digital creative practices and artefacts; Supporting creative and cultural industries to think about how they may adapt and develop their propositions for machinima creators, including how machinimators may be included as a resource for their industries, criteria for participation, legal and moral implications of involvement; Providing an evidence base to inform policymakers' thinking on new types of creative endeavour within digital and virtual contexts, and how this may support policy development for access to creative and cultural sectors nationally and internationally; Increasing public awareness within the UK of the roles and creative potential of machinima, with a view to enhancing cultural and social benefits for participants and non-participants.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL014203%2F1

Dr. Alison Rooke is sociologist whose teaching and research is concerned the dynamics of participation in the city brought about through arts-based urban interventions, urban planning, research and evaluation as well as informal spaces of citizenship and community. She is also CoDirector of the Centre for Urban and Community Research (CUCR) an established interdisciplinary research centre within Goldsmiths' Department of Sociology with a distinguished history of collaboration with local communities, activists and cross-sectoral stakeholders. Her work lies at the overlap of visual sociology and experimental methods exploring the philosophical underpinnings of sociological representation, and the ways that understandings of representation inform the epistemology of social research. Along with colleagues in the Sociology Department she shares a concern with concerned with 'The Social Life of Method' (Savage et al 2013) and 'Live Sociology' (Back and Puwar 2012). Alison has been influenced by ideas that challenge the notion that research impacts on society 'as if from the outside'. If research 'works' or is successful, it is by virtue of a variety of social actors contributing to it on an on-going basis, well before the research can be framed as a 'product' or as an 'outcome'. Indeed, much of Alison's evaluative research is co-constructed carried out in tandem with others outside of the academy. Alison continues to be engaged in a wide range of activities that embed this approach in a number of highly practical endeavours. Her work spans: the public sector; the policy community; the business community; international organisations; the community and third sector; the media; and 'publics' of various sorts. Alison's work has been concerned with developing critical and collaborative approaches to research and evaluation. She has an outstanding track record in developing a critical and participative approach to the evaluation of a variety of urban interventions spanning citizenship, community development, urban planning and participatory and socially engaged arts at a local, national and international level.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM504142%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The central focus of this research is producing reliable, accessible and scholarly reading texts of Robert Burns for both the academic and general reader in the 21st Century, specifically Burns's Poetry and Correspondence. The Poetry has not been freshly edited in complete form since the 1960s, and the present edition will take advantage of around 75 new manuscript and 55 new print material discoveries. The two volumes of 'Poetry' will also include a proportion of 'Song' texts, which have been presented and read, historically, as 'Poetry' texts. Much will be made in the descriptive apparatuses and criticism produced by the 'Poetry' part of the project of 'Burns Song as Poetry'. Similarly, the Correspondence will capitalise upon around 100 new manuscript and 60 new print material discoveries. These three volumes of letters will also be the first time ever that there has been an edition of any kind, let alone a scholarly one, that brings together both sides of Burns's correspondence in its fully extant form. Correspondence to Burns has either never been published previously (about 50 per cent of this material), or it has been badly edited and often bowdlerized in print.  As well as attempting to produce as complete and helpful a reading experience as possible through the application of modern textual editing techniques and providing explanatory annotation (of historical matters, the Scots language and other biographical and cultural information), 'Editing Robert Burns for the 21st Century: Poetry and Correspondence' also allows a 'behind the scenes' or 'hands on' approach for the reader who desires it. This will occur through four substantial online workshops on the editing of Burns, including the large hinterland of forged and facsimile material sometimes mistaken for the real thing. Editorial possibilities and choices are explained for the editing of Burns song, poetry and correspondence (the material for the first among these three drawn from the AHRC-funded 'Editing Robert Burns for the 21st Century', 2011-16, and the resultant Oxford University Press volumes published, or to be published - 2014, 2016 and 2018). These workshops are intended to be accessible to the generally interested 'layperson' as well as providing insight for other scholars and also archivists, curators, librarians and rare book and manuscript dealers, all of whom make up the substantial Robert Burns area of the Cultural Heritage sector. This online material will also be directly related to the 'Introductions on the Text' sections of each of the new OUP volumes. Similarly, and with additional benefits to the Burns Tourist sector, the interactive map of Burns's correspondents and their locations provides an accessible and path-breaking mapping of Burns's social, cultural and intellectual networks during the late eighteenth century.  The research for 'Editing Robert Burns for the 21st Century: Correspondence and Poetry' will also be showcased in public-facing workshops at four different geographical locations where there are holdings of Burns manuscripts: Alloway, Dumfries, Edinburgh and Irvine. Likewise three articles in peer-reviewed journals will also be of specialist editing interest to the academic community.","'Editing Robert Burns for the 21st Century: Correspondence and Poetry' will not only be of benefit to the academic community, but will also be of direct relevance to the Robert Burns Heritage Sector. As mentioned elsewhere in this application, four symposia will be held at venues of partner members of 'Burns Scotland'. Burns Scotland is the nationally recognised ('distributed') Robert Burns collection encompassing national institutions and local authorities. Our events will be open to the public of these different museums and libraries and will be based upon opening up the collections of these partners in tandem with the editing work of the project. Additionally, our online workshops (again detailed elsewhere on this form), will be of relevance to the wider Burns public, as well as to curators, archivists and rare booksellers. The Burns Chronicle (organ of the Worldwide Burns Federation, over 250 Burns Clubs and over 35,000 members worldwide) is keen to report our progress on the editing of Burns's Correspondence and Poetry. Our four substantial online workshops will discuss such issues as paper-types, watermarks, dating and, indeed, forgery. Our list of forgeries and facsimiles will bring together for the first time a database on Burnsian phenomena which have never been comprehensively collated before. Burnsians, Burns 'professionals' and tourists, home and abroad, will be interested in material, manuscripts, objects and virtual exhibitions, generally, within our workshops and in our 'tour' sections (see below) which link to various repositories and museums, operating in partnership with the University of Glasgow editing project. For the years, 2012-15 'Editing Robert Burns for the 21st Century' has had over 40 stories in the local, national and world press and media. Given the likely interest in Burns's Correspondence and Poetry this is a figure I would predict to be superseded in the new project.  Our activity will be available to enhance the wide swathe of Burns tourist activity (over 47,000 footfall alone in 2014-15 at the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum), but will also more specifically, via our interactive map of Burns's Correspondents, allow a resource for people planning bespoke Burns tours. Links via the Burns Scotland partner websites will foreground, indeed, propose the itineraries of these local 'trails'. Initial discussions with 'Visit Scotland' (the national tourism umbrella of Scotland) and the National Trust for Scotland have seen both express interest in having our correspondents and tour material linked from their websites, as being of particular interest to tourists to 'Burns Country'.  Internationally, as well as interest from the Worldwide Burns Federation, the Robert Burns Association of North America is also keenly interested in our editing project and represents a strong sales element for the Oxford University Press edition of the Works of Burns, of which Poetry and Correspondence will form a part. Among regular trips to RBANA partners, the PI will address the Calgary Burns Supper in 2017 (800 attendees) on the edition. The work and outputs of 'Editing Robert Burns for the 21st Century: Correspondence and Poetry' have a large potential audience in the wider community, including the interest of as many as 35,000 Burnsians and a much larger tourism community. As well as being a scholarly project, it has a natural reach not only to a large public interest group (via our existing social media as well as through our symposia), but to the heritage sector represented by 'Burns Scotland'.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP004946%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Indigenous Ecologies in South Asia aims to 1) consolidate, through practices of co-creation, an indigenous methodology for filmmaking; 2) develop a culture of indigenous research-based filmmaking that address asymmetries in the public sphere; and 3) research different ecologies of indigenous film.   The proposed project is based on a research partnership with a collective of indigenous artists and filmmakers belonging India's DeNotified Tribal communities (DNTs) and associated with Nomad Movies. These are communities who were labelled as 'criminal by birth' during the colonial period, who have been actively excluded from processes of knowledge production, as well as from citizenship, and who continue to be misrepresented in mainstream media through the frames of criminality, primitivism and victimhood. The project consolidates a methodology and form of filmmaking developed to document indigenous experiences of the global pandemic and takes it to different regions and communities at India's borderlands: the sea, the desert and the mountains. These are sites of ecological disruption that are becoming increasingly unliveable with rising sea beds, uncharacteristic rainfall patterns, increased heat and desertification- where traditional patterns of migration, of livelihood, nutrition and shelter are being challenged and where communities are having to adapt fast to new conditions of life.    The project is designed as an action-research intervention based on collective reflexive practice that comprises: 1) a training component involving technical training in filmmaking adapted to the needs of communities with low literacy and digital skills, in combination with training in research methods and collective reflexive practice to support communities in developing their own research questions and projects, while drawing on and transforming their creative practice; 2) a promotional component with the objective of developing a culture of indigenous filmmaking, consolidating Nomad Movies as a hub for indigenous film and at developing a 'Nomad Film Festival'; and 3) a research component focussed on the transformations in communities' artistic practices, both in relation to the training and in relation to the expansion of the digital as an imperative to participate in the country's creative economies.    The value of the project lies in the process itself - and in this respect its outputs and impacts, methodology and epistemology, are enmeshed. In terms of tangible outputs, the project will result in 1) the production of at least six fiction and non-fiction films that will be showcased as part of the Nomad Film Festival, alongside selected films produced by indigenous groups across the country; 2) the creation of a Nomad Film Festival as a hub for indigenous film publications in the country; 3) publications reflecting on the processes and methodology and on the transformation of artistic practices in these border regions. More broadly, the project will contribute to a transformation of collaborative research practice, moving beyond 'participatory' models and socially engaged art practices. It will also be an intervention into multimodal methods of knowledge production, while providing a platform for an emergent and vibrant community of praxis.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX00693X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The project is a new intervention into academic, political, and public debates on the history of the British coal industry between 1947 and 1994. The study is particularly timely given the recent closure of Kellingley in December 2015 the last deep coal mine in Britain. It draws upon both the experiential and academic knowledge of PI Gildart who spent seven years as an underground coal miner in Wales between 1985 and 1992. The research will be based on extensive archival work in the coalfields, a comprehensive oral history project, interaction with former miners and colliery managers, a partnership with mining museums, and the development of a comprehensive interactive website, blog and touring exhibition. It will explore the development of the industry, its workplace cultures, industrial identities, politics, and individual and collective experiences through a detailed examination of eight collieries located in England, Scotland and Wales: Bickershaw Colliery (Lancashire, 1830-1992), Easington Colliery (Durham, 1899-1993), Hatfield Colliery (Yorkshire, 1916-2015), Annesley-Bentinck Colliery (Nottinghamshire, 1865-2000), Markham Colliery (Derbyshire, 1882-1993), Barony Colliery (Ayrshire, 1910-1989), Tower Colliery (Cynon Valley, 1864-2008), and Point of Ayr Colliery (Flintshire, 1890-1996).  The oral history project will seek to understand the everyday experiences of coal miners and officials in the workplace, the community and the domestic sphere. This will involve interviews with around 80 participants and substantial community engagement in former mining localities. As such it represents a landmark scholarly intervention into the history of the industry by examining policy development, deployment and reception at macro (Government/NCB), meso (coalfield) and micro (colliery/community/domestic) levels. The project will tease out the unifying and diversifying identities and tensions in the eight collieries and their connected communities. In contrast with much of the existing scholarship on the industry there will be a specific emphasis on gender, generation, masculinity, femininity and regional/national identity and how these aspects of mining life contributed to a sense of individual and collective memory.  The research will be organised around particular themes: the political evolution of public ownership and its local social/political impact, occupational culture and identity, the tensions between divergent industrial relations cultures and their impact on organisations, the changing nature of underground work, masculinity, gender relations, community fragmentation, deindustrialisation, memory, heritage, and the resilience of occupational and class identities. Chronologically the project will shed new light on key-moments in the history of the coal industry such as the debates around the nature of public ownership, the industrial disputes of 1972, 1974 and 1984/5 and the subsequent closure of all of the nation's deep mines in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. Yet just as importantly it will gauge the impact of these events on miners, their wives/girlfriends, children, and the wider community in which the collieries were located. The project will go beyond the organisational/institutional frameworks adopted by many historians of the industry in order to reveal both the unifying and fragmentary nature of occupational, national, local, and class identity.    The comprehensive coverage of the eight collieries, will support, stimulate and publicize research material that will be of use to academics, policymakers, schools, and the three major mining museums of England, Scotland and Wales. The website and published outputs will ensure that the project has broad impact in both the academic and public sphere. The project represents a significant reappraisal of the importance of the coal industry in shaping the identities, politics, and cultures of industrial localities in post-war Britain.","Who benefits? The project will have significant public impact benefitting from the social and cultural connections developed by PI Gildart during his experience as a coal miner and CI Perchard through his expertise as a former head of energy supply policy in the Scottish Executive. This will be complemented by a dissemination strategy informed by the advisory board. The website and oral history project will be of value to diverse groups including: - Museums/archives: coal mining museums in England, Scotland and Wales - Local historians/local history societies/colliery preservation groups - Primary schools/high schools - Institutions investigating their own history: the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) (Scottish Area, Yorkshire Area, North Wales Area, North Western Area, North East Area, Nottinghamshire Area, North Derbyshire Area, South Wales Area), the British Association of Colliery Management (BACM), the National Association of the Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS), and the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation (CISWO). - Surviving Miners' Welfare Institutes  - Family historians - Those promoting local historical awareness e.g. the North Wales Miners Association Trust - Local history organisations including but not exclusive to named project partners. - The project will more generally stimulate and support public engagement with twentieth century British history. The first version of the website will be available early in year one, along with the project blog and the bi-monthly 'colliery of the month' feature, with a mechanism to support public submission of former miners and their families.  Anticipated benefits include: - Recognition by user groups of the value of the coal industry for understanding continuity and change in British society. The development of awareness that the eight selected collieries were symbolic of the link between work, identity, community, culture and politics in the post-war period. They were also crucial in engendering a sense of individual and collective identity that reached beyond the workplace. By identifying, recovering and making accessible the history of the collieries, the project supports and publicises the work of local historians, as well as stimulating and activating local communities' and institutions' interest in their own histories - Project partners will benefit from assistance in recovering and recording evidence of the history of the collieries and from participation in project events. The good practice in retrieving evidence of the importance of the collieries in working, domestic and socio/political lives will be disseminated in the wider local history constituency. - Greater knowledge/understanding of coal mining resources in national and local mining museums and record offices, including those run by local authorities, leading to more footfall among all types of user - Impact on archival repositories' acquisition, as the significance of new material related to the eight collieries is highlighted. Targeted institutions will be the named partners but also the People's History Museum (Manchester), the Working Class Movement Library (Salford), and the Modern Records Centre (University of Warwick). - The website will be promoted as a resource for schools and colleges in the specific coalfields and beyond the chosen localities: its content (images, text, finding guides and downloadable education packs) will support teaching at various levels from primary to A-Level. - The project's recovery of documentation and artefacts will extend and deepen collections held in partner organisations. This will not only assist in the interpretation of such sites for visitors, but could facilitate re-enactments of mining life that could enhance the reputation of mining museums as visitor attractions. - The findings will also inform the historical content of courses offered by organisations such as the General Federation of Trade Unions",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP007244%2F1

In this field, there is a range of literature discussing 'Civic Media' to examine how media practices and technologies employed by grassroots groups have helped to advance rights and social justice. We will contribute to this debate by focusing on the civic media practices utilised in the housing rights struggles across Lagos and São Paulo, where rights violations are threatening lives and livelihoods of marginalised groups living in insecure housing.  In São Paulo, local government has recently endorsed evictions that violate housing rights, while in Lagos, government-led evictions and harassment of informal dwellers have persisted even after court orders condemned these as unlawful. Social movements and their support networks in both cities have used digital and social media practices to share information about the threat of evictions and denounce these housing rights violations. In São Paulo, social movements have used on-line manifestos, webinars and digital mapping tools to generate public debates about these violations and to amplify the voices of the urban poor. Meanwhile, grassroots groups in Lagos' informal settlements have developed films, exhibitions and digital stories aimed at mobilising public support against evictions while also challenging social stigma associated with residents of informal settlements. In both cities, it is crucial that these civic media initiatives can be strengthened to improve their capacity to shape equitable decision-making processes and support more inclusive visions of urban development.  This project will support and learn from these initiatives by focusing on how civic media can influence policy and planning processes in Lagos and São Paulo. The research activities will identify specific short- and longer-term opportunities to support housing rights by reducing unlawful evictions and other violations, while at the same time securing policy instruments that can promote access to adequate housing and enhance recognition for marginalised urban citizens. During our participatory action research project, we will carry out civic media campaigns in both cities targeting these specific planning opportunities. At the same time, we will analyse the lessons learnt and impacts of these experiences, with the intention to inform debates and practice about how civic media can advance social justice in cities.  Our project's public-facing outputs will mainly target policy and planning processes in Lagos and São Paulo to raise policymakers' awareness of marginalised residents' voices and priorities. By doing this, we hope that urban plans are better able to recognise the diverse needs of the urban poor and support programmes that can upgrade informal settlements and other precarious housing via participatory processes. Through academic papers and a tool-kit on civic media for housing rights, we will share key lessons with international networks of practitioners, civil society organisations, and engaged academics interested in using civic media to enhance the capabilities of social movements to advance housing rights. Finally, we also seek to influence international donors and foundations by discussing how to promote housing rights using community-led communication activities.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW005980%2F1

Our objectives are to understand the acceptance or marginalisation of BVI musicians within professional, amateur and educational musical communities; their involvement with different musical styles, instruments, practices and roles; opportunities and barriers they perceive in relation to personal development and participation throughout the life-course, along with their adaptive strategies; and their learning practices, both when they were children and into adult life, including how, for example, a blind professional musician prepares for a concert. Findings from our pilot study have indicated that BVI musicians tend to feel, on one hand, excluded and discriminated against; and on the other, highly respected amongst musicians generally for their abilities. Overall, there is a pressing need to develop and share information and increase understanding. The findings will be relevant for many parts of the musical community, including employers such as orchestras, educational providers including conservatoires and schools, music therapy organisations, community music groups, and others. Our investigation will begin with a questionnaire survey extended to 700 musicians who are currently registered with the RNIB (Royal National Institute for Blind People) as being BVI musicians. The survey will explore the demographics of musical participation (e.g. age, gender, instrument choice, reasons for starting or stopping musical participation, musical idiom, training background, and so forth). A purposive sample of approximately 40 of the adult participants will then be invited to contribute detailed life history interviews. The interviewees will represent a range of genres and instrumental disciplines, with a mix of professional and amateur performers, composers and teachers. They will be of various ages and sight-loss backgrounds. The study will look at their musical pathways from childhood to adulthood, their life-course issues, their musical practices, perceived barriers, and successful adaptations to musical participation.  There will be two half-day seminars held at the Institute of Education, University of London to allow respondents to network, reflect on preliminary findings and offer feedback, and feedback will also be sought throughout the fieldwork process. Our pilot interviewees highlighted the need to belong to a community of music practitioners who share a disability, since this augurs for gaining information necessary for musical development. A website will be created that is accessible both to sighted and BVI visitors. It will be search-engine optimised and linked to the RNIB site and other prominent music industry sites; and the aforementioned survey will be linked to this site. The website will assist in recruiting participants and sharing information about the reflective seminars, our main conference event and findings. There will also be a blog to which the research participants can contribute, thus assisting in building a national network of BVI musicians. These blog reflections will become part of the analysis with respondents' permission. Finally, the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) have agreed to invite the PI, CI and RNIB colleagues to present findings within the LRAM diploma and Open Academy programmes; from this platform, outreach days will be formed that engage music undergraduates in powerful, life-enhancing practical experiences with BVI adult musicians and children.","The project will raise awareness of BVI musicians and, in light of the present lack of information, have the potential to feed into policy at institutional, local government or community level.  Music-making occurs within formal settings such as concert-halls, schools and universities but also in isolation from specialist knowledge, which is a concern. Amateur and leisure activities (such as small instrumental groups, ensembles or music productions) can occur in village halls, in pubs or clubs, or in people's homes. Many sighted musicians are unsure where to access information that will allow them to counter the social exclusion of BVI musicians and raise participation. During our pilot, every interviewee mentioned exclusion. Findings will help community organisations such as amateur orchestras to serve the needs of someone who, for instance, is losing sight and wishes to continue participating effectively.  This issue of isolation from necessary knowledge is significant, too, when one considers that a vast quantity of qualified and unqualified instrumental teachers operate from home. We will optimise our site for search engines and link it to the online presence of bodies such as Local Authority music hubs, professional and community organisations, and national examination boards, creating widespread access. There will be an 'open' invitation to musicians (i.e. amateurs, professionals, delegates from other institutions and organisations) interested in attending our main conference event.  The RNIB will also take the lead in dissemination to its international partner organisations. Furthermore, outcomes will be useful to curriculum designers, particularly the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM), which is a major international stakeholder in instrumental examinations. Owing to their previous research, the PI and CI have an established, dynamic working relationship with the ABRSM Syllabus Director, Dr Nigel Scaife. He and Jacqui Seal, who is responsible for ABRSM special needs, are interested in this work and its potential ramifications for the accessibility and structure of their music syllabus.  The project will develop knowledge that will assist conservatoires, working particularly with the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), to assess and develop its opportunities for both sighted and BVI students. The RAM is actively engaged with outreach and community music-making. The project will, through talks given by the PI, CI and RNIB partners, allow RAM students to understand the practices and issues surrounding BVI musicians and, consequently, engage with them more effectively. Findings will be threaded into their LRAM diploma and undergraduate programmes. The RNIB, RAM and Institute of Education (IoE) will form suitable musical collaborations that will bring together sighted undergraduates and BVI musicians (adults and children). This augurs for the 'preparedness' of future music educators and community music leaders to cater for this group. The immediate impact will be one of improving 'quality of life' for the BVI attendees. These events will also enhance wider cultural life into the future. It is hoped that the RAM, one of the 'Royal Schools of Music', will serve as a 'flagship' conservatoire in this respect for Conservatoires UK.  The website, reports and other publications will highlight both unique and shared BVI lived experiences, which were previously the private domain of individuals. The website will raise interest and participation in the research. The reflective seminars, blog and conference, which are part of the research process, will bring together BVI individuals with common experiences and, as such, will assist in the development and strengthening of the national network of BVI musicians. Our pilot interviewees underscored the need to belong to such a community.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK003291%2F1

The failure by key stakeholders, and policy makers in particular, to recognise the skills offered by the Humanities (defined broadly) is a real concern. The core skillset relevant to business is that of narrative creation, transmission, understanding, and reception. This skillset is taught broadly across almost all disciplines within the Humanities, but it is rarely described in these terms. Moreover, none of the many initiatives to promote the Humanities has explicitly focused on this angle. Doing so is potentially a powerful and novel way of communicating why the Humanities are relevant to business and, more broadly, to STEM subjects, government, education, and society itself. This proposal, therefore, outlines a project to examine how narrative skills are understood, deployed, and valued within business contexts. A rapid interview study will be undertaken with CEOs from a diverse range of businesses and organisations to produce a report that the AHRC will be able to use across its networks to raise the profile of the Arts and Humanities. A high-profile steering group has been put together to ensure unprecedented access to key business leaders and that the report has maximum impact in the media as well as business and policy contexts.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV009079%2F1

UCA's research profile includes peer-reviewed publications, practice-based research and collaborative research all within the field of creative arts, creative technologies and business for the creative industries. Our impact is demonstrable through our impact case studies (REF 2021) and through our numerous externally-facing outputs, as measured in the Social, Community and Cultural Engagement table in the annual HE-BCI survey. The aim of our research impact strategy is to build our capacity for interactions with our stakeholders, including business and the wider community, and increase activities concerned with the generation, use, application and exploitation of knowledge, increasing our global impact within the creative industries. This application is focused on three themes within the creative industries: circular economy innovations; digital and technological futures in the creative industries; collaborative practice in local and regional creative communities. These are all areas of strong research at UCA with an established or emerging impact record. All have clear untapped potential and the capacity for investment to add value in a developing impact and KE profile. 1.

The immediate and mid-term aims of the IAA account during the three year's funding is to sustain and build momentum for the UCA Innovation Hub. We aim to: - Widen participation in business engagement and knowledge exchange. - Increase the mobility of people and ideas. - Broaden and enhance the skills of our researchers. To achieve these aims we will use the IAA funds to support the following objectives: - Foster industry engagement: the IAA will support UCA in working with businesses to drive economic growth, productivity and resilience. Working largely (not exclusively) within the innovation priorities identified in the previous section, the IAA will enable rapid and flexible response to external opportunities as they arise. - Develop interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration: the IAA will encourage, support and enable, cross-sector collaborations and interdisciplinary working, for instance, between AI and VR and the digital arts, and across management and economics and creative industries in our Business School for the Creative Industries. - Be inclusive and empowering for our staff: the IAA will create an open and inclusive environment where academic staff feel valued and supported to engage with the creative industries, communities, and organisations locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally. - Enhance our impact culture: developing our impact by creating strong connections between our research, impact and KE activities with a positive flow in multiple directions. - Training and professional development: integrating impact and KE into the University's Schools and Research Centres, enabling new and compelling collaboration with the creative industries, including through the development of our CPD offer. - Generate, support and sustain wider engagement: by pro-actively developing and sustaining industry engagement by academics, within Schools and in cross-School collaborations.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX003167%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Inscriptions on stone are the most important and numerous category of written document created by the inhabitants of the ancient city of Athens that has survived through to the present day. Of the over 20,000 such inscriptions dating from the 7th cent. BC to the 3rd cent. AD that are extant, around 1% (ca. 220) are in British collections, mostly (ca. 163) in the British Museum (BM), but including also other collections, such as the Ashmolean museum, Oxford, and the Fitzwilliam museum, Cambridge, private collections, and the British School at Athens. Most of the inscriptions are records of decisions of the citizen Assembly and other bodies, financial accounts, leases, dedications to the gods and funerary monuments. Many of them are decorated with relief sculpture, and they are a resource of the first importance for scholars and students as well as potentially engaging monuments for visitors to the museums and collections where they are located. Generally speaking, however, these inscriptions have suffered from neglect. The last systematic edition of the Attic inscriptions in the BM dates from 1874, and it is for the most part this edition that is the basis for the museum's current online catalogue. Since 1874 the landscape has been completely transformed, not only by the accession of new inscriptions to the museum's collection, but by the progress of scholarship. For example, thousands of Attic inscriptions have since been discovered, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of inscriptions already known; this includes in many cases new fragments of inscriptions in the BM. 1874 predates even the first editions of the authoritative corpora of Attic inscriptions (IG I and II), published in the 1870s-1890s, which set their study on a systematic footing, and which have themselves long been overtaken by second and third editions. We propose a two-pronged approach to this material designed to make it accessible in an up-to-date fashion to scholars, students and the general public. Central to this approach is Attic Inscriptions Online (AIO), a website launched in 2012 which publishes annotated English translations of Attic inscriptions, together with supporting academic papers (AIO Papers). First we propose to publish new editions of the inscriptions in a series of 17 AIO Papers each of which will cover an individual collection, or in the case of the BM a category of inscriptions (e.g. decrees, dedications, funerary monuments). Based on the most up-to-date scholarly bibliography, supplemented by fresh autopsy of the stones, and supported by photographs, the AIO Papers will contain new editions of the inscriptions, together with textual notes, translations and commentaries. The main mode of publication will be online on AIO, where the Papers will be available to view and download without charge, but hard copies will also be published. This will transform the utility and accessibility of this material to scholars. Second, entries including translations and photographs will be published on the main AIO site, with notes aimed at the user without good knowledge of Latin and Greek, including school students and museum visitors. At the same time we will engage with the curators of collections to make the translations and information about the inscriptions on AIO available to the public, both via online catalogues and directly to museum visitors in real time. This will include advising and assisting with preparation of e.g. display boards on which there will be automatic links to AIO material, via the British Museum's mobile web-platform, or via QR codes which will enable direct access to AIO on mobile phones. Materials will be developed, designed to enhance and facilitate teaching and learning based on the Attic inscriptions in the UK by school students, both virtually and via visits to the collections, stored in a section of the site specially designed for the purpose, following testing by teachers collaborating on the project.","Apart from the benefits to academic researchers, outlined above, the project will benefit the following: (a) Curators of collections where the inscriptions are held. AIUK will enable them to provide a more reliable, complete, up-to-date, and enlightening experience to visitors from academic researchers, to teachers and students, to members of the public with no prior knowledge, both online and in person. This will apply especially to the British Museum, where, in the absence of a specialist curator, the information currently supplied is particularly outdated, the collection is particularly sizeable and relatively underutilized, and the visitor numbers are among the highest of any museum in the world. Smaller collections will be able to use the product of AIUK to enhance their visibility, communications and marketing around the inscriptions in their collections. Online visitors to AIO will be stimulated to visit local collections and to seek out the Attic inscriptions in them, whether this be the BM or a local country house. Overall AIUK has the potential to increase visitor numbers to relevant collections and the quality of the visitor experience. (b) Visitors to collections. AIUK will enhance their appreciation, at every academic level, of the major role played by stone inscriptions in ancient Athenian culture, and enrich their understanding of the many areas of history into which they provide an insight, including narrative history, politics, empire and ""democracy"", warfare, attitudes to death, religious beliefs and practices, associative life, the family and other aspects of economy and society.  (c) Universities and University teachers. AIUK will enhance their capacity to teach effectively about the major role played by stone inscriptions in ancient Athenian culture, and to deploy inscriptions as evidential sources, both online, by direct use of materials available on AIO, and via museum visits.  (d) University students. AIUK will enhance their appreciation of the major role played by stone inscriptions in ancient Athenian culture, and enrich their understanding of the many areas of history into which they provide an insight (see b above). This will have beneficial knock-on effects, e.g. in making future generations of researchers, University and school teachers better equipped to teach Ancient History (in which Athenian history plays a major role) more effectively. (e) School exam boards and syllabus creators in UK and internationally. By the supply of free, user-friendly and open access to this significant body of source material, it will provide an incentive to increase the (currently in the UK very slight) role accorded to Attic inscriptions in exam syllabi.  (f) Teachers in schools, in the UK and internationally. Essentially the same potential impact as (c), with an appropriate adjustment of academic level. AIUK will enable them to offer a more vibrant and rounded historical learning experience to their students. (g) School students, in the UK and internationally. AIUK will enhance their appreciation of the major role played by stone inscriptions in ancient Athenian culture, and enrich their understanding of the many areas of history into which they provide an insight (see b above). This will have beneficial knock-on effects, e.g. in increasing the level of knowledge and understanding of Ancient History, and the importance of inscriptions as historical sources, among potential University students. (h) Online visitors to AIO, at whatever academic level. They will benefit from the significant enhancement of the site represented by AIUK, including enhanced presentation of this body of material (e.g. photographs, dual level presentation), and the integration of it with other material on AIO, enabling Attic inscriptions both in UK and outside the UK to be better appreciated. (i) Knock-on impacts will arise from AIO's role in the semantic web, e.g. from deployment of AIO outputs on other sites (e.g IG online).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP015069%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              How do philosophy and architecture give us a distinctive way of understanding equality, and how can this have impacts on the wellbeing of individuals and communities? This is the primary question this project aims to address. We will look at an alternative history of the concept of equality found in both the 17th-century philosophy of Spinoza and in architectural thought. Here, equality is understood in terms of proportion, a way of thinking that can lead to new strategies for increasing equalities of wellbeing. Standard notions of equality originate in the Enlightenment social contract tradition and depend on the assumption that every human being is an autonomous, rational subject. The resulting notion of the moral equality of reasoning subjects undergirds both 18th century political thought (e.g. Rousseau and Kant) and dominant theories of justice today (e.g. Rawls and Sen). The notion that all persons are moral equals is foundational in arguments for political equality and universal rights. However, while liberal democracies have increasingly committed to the political equality of citizens, their societies have become less and less economically equal over the past fifty years. Recent studies such as Wilkinson and Pickett's The Spirit Level have demonstrated the link between income equality and wellbeing. Wellbeing and ""happiness"" as indicators of national progress are now high on the public agenda. We are interested in finding out whether a concept of equality different from the standard moral-political sense, might provide a better foundation for arguments for income equality and greater wellbeing. This alternative concept of equality is connected to an alternative concept of human subjectivity found in the 17th-century philosophy of Baruch Spinoza. Spinoza sees people not as equal rational subjects, but as fundamentally unequal individuals whose capacity for reasoning and freedom constantly varies with their bodily constitution, political circumstances, and emotional and social situation. He suggests that we should abandon the assumption of absolute moral equality, and instead look to ideas of geometrical proportion and mathematical ratio in order to understand what defines individuals, distinguishes them from others, and allows them to bind together into communities. What emerges is a concept of proportional equality which, if put into practice (Spinoza believes) would result in a greater equality of wellbeing among all individuals. Our contention is that thinking about equality in this Spinozian way can provide a foundation for societies to pursue equalities of wellbeing amongst citizens. In Architecture, there is a long tradition of connecting a proportional conception of equality with wellbeing. From Vitruvius's classical treatise On Architecture, through to Renaissance and Enlightenment aesthetic ideals, through to modernist utopian building and social housing projects, architects have upheld geometric criteria of proportion and harmony. In the 20th century these criteria were strongly linked to generating greater equalities of wellbeing through housing design. While this connection was recognized, and standards of living space protected, in the 1960s-70s, it has been ignored over the past 25 years due to the drive for large quantities of affordable housing. As architectural theory and practice remain focused on increasing wellbeing, there is a need to interpret and discuss the connection to proportional equality in a distinctive way. In the project we will do philosophical analysis on Spinoza's concept of proportional equality and connect it to case studies to see how it can be realized in architectural theory and affordable housing design. We will consult with professional groups and charities aiming at greater wellbeing through income equality and housing standards. The final outcomes will be a series of papers and a documentary film that will be accessible to a wide audience.","We anticipate that the research will have three kinds of non-academic beneficiary: 1. Groups influencing government policy (UK) Happiness and wellbeing are now central to statistical research and government policy. The Equality Trust, a charitable organization that aims to influence policy, campaigns to make governments focus on income equality as the key means to improving wellbeing. Action for Happiness draws on academic research to harness efforts to increase social wellbeing. Its parent charity, The Young Foundation, builds on research to develop social projects and influence policy. Its communities and housing team develops projects and tools aimed at improving wellbeing through the built environment. Think-tank The New Economics Foundation's Centre for Wellbeing works to improve wellbeing through various means including the built environment. 2. Professional architectural associations (UK) Organizations for architects and built-environment professionals engage with how housing quality affects wellbeing. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), now part of the Design Council, aims to put architecture and design at the heart of social renewal, and works with a wide range of organizations to inform the design professsion. The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) promotes better architecture at a policy level and in the profession; its Future Homes Commission investigates whether the size and quality of newly-built homes are fit for purpose. The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) is the national agency in England that invests in new affordable housing and in improving existing social housing. 3. Charitable groups concerned with housing and wellbeing (UK) The Joseph Rowntree Foundation works in a range of fields relevant to our research: housing market reform, housing planning, and assessing housing trends. Shelter is the leading authority on homelessness and poor housing in Britain and its research and policy section has a direct impact on its campaigning and services. We aim to engage with the research and policy sections of these groups to have an impact on their body of knowledge and thinking, to feed into their campaigns, services, and practical activities. Our research aims to provide a philosophical foundation for a concept of equality that has a demonstrable link to increased wellbeing, and to apply this concept to architecture and the built environment. The research will benefit these groups, first, by providing a philosophical foundation for the connection between equality and wellbeing, something that has not previously been done. This will deepen their knowledge-base and add to its academic credibility. Second, the research will provide models and case studies for how equalities of wellbeing can be improved through affordable housing design. This will enhance their research and feed into specific projects and practices that improve communities through housing. Third, the research has potential to ground and generate related future projects. In the first year of the project members of these groups will be invited to attend the initial seminar and to join our project advisory panel. They will be consulted on the aims and methods of our research at the outset, and consulted regularly through the project on methods, findings, and potential applications of the research, so that we monitor and understand the research impacts. We aim to post links to our website and position papers on the websites of some of these groups, and to advertise through their Facebook and Twitter feeds, thus benefiting their members and followers more widely. See the 'Pathways to Impact' document for further detail of these activities. We have contacted many of the named groups, and several of them have indicated their interest in being on the advisory panel, including the Design Council, the New Economics Foundation, and several professional architects.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK00042X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The study of science and technology's interactions with literature and the arts, while an established field in European and North American academic contexts, has not been widely pursued within Latin American studies. This is due in part to the perception that Latin America has not been a hub of scientific production and thus has lacked a receptive aesthetic culture that reacts to news of such innovations, particularly in the frenzied period of scientific and technological breakthroughs during the nineteenth century and beyond. The 'Science in Text and Culture in Latin America' network will seek to rectify this assumption by bringing together a group of scholars to study the diverse ways in which Latin American writers and artists have responded to scientific and technological innovations occurring both locally and globally, from the nineteenth century to the present day. We will respond to research, recently published and in progress, that is starting to reveal a wealth of histories, methodologies and interpretations of the dialogues that existed between these two apparently distinct realms. To enhance this conversation, the network includes contemporary writers, film directors and dramatists from Latin America whose work is informed by advances in science and technology, and who employ science to imagine alternative histories or views of their region.  We have planned a number of activities over the course of two years to maximize the potential of the network. Firstly, we will organize four international symposia in Oxford, Buenos Aires, San Juan (Puerto Rico) and Cambridge, each of which will be structured around different historical, cultural and aesthetic questions concerning the relationship between science and the arts. All four encounters will feature conversations between researchers and creative practitioners whose works cross the boundaries between these two realms. We are especially keen to offer travel bursaries to postgraduate and postdoctoral students, to allow them to participate actively in these international encounters. In the first symposium, hosted by the University of Oxford, we will focus on what happens when we cross the boundaries between science and art, both in creative practice and in research, and raise awareness of the value of interdisciplinary approaches. The second symposium, to be held in San Juan, will focus specifically on the phenomenon of science fiction in the region. The third symposium, to be held in Buenos Aires, will explore the historical conversations between science and literature in Latin America, and how these in turn yield theories of what it means to be modern. In the last symposium, at the University of Cambridge, we will ask what light recent theories of creativity and evolution can throw on our understanding of innovation both in science and in creative writing (or other forms of narrative art). Aside from bringing renowned artists from Latin America to the UK, such as the Argentine dramatist Rafael Spregelburd, the two UK-based symposia will develop comparative perspectives by featuring talks by scholars working on European and Anglo-American literature and science.  Beyond the international symposia, a number of other activities will also take place within the network period to extend the impact of the project to the general public. These include screenings of Latin American science fiction films in Cambridge and London, and an exhibition of Mexican, Argentine and Brazilian texts and artifacts from the nineteenth century to the present in Oxford's History of Science Museum, as well as a network website, which will be regularly updated. Two edited books and a number of articles will come out of the network, marking its intervention in Latin American and interdisciplinary studies. The network harbours a number of exciting possibilities beyond its two-year period of operation, and will pave the way for applications for a major research grant on this theme.","The principal non-academic beneficiaries of this research network will be a) the local communities in Cambridge, Oxford and London (UK), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and San Juan (Puerto Rico) who will attend events designed with the general public in mind, and b) journalists, writers, and other members of the wider public in the UK, Europe, US and Latin America with an interest in science fiction, the history of science and/or Latin America. The social, cultural and economic benefits of this research network will include the following:  1. Raising awareness among the general public in the UK and abroad of the particular ways in which themes of universal interest (science, modernity and technology) have been inscribed in Latin American literature and culture, thereby expanding knowledge and providing a broader understanding of the importance of these themes in culture and society. 2. Reinforcing the value of the national and regional literary, artistic and cultural heritage for the general public in Argentina and Puerto Rico.  3. Generating audiences and revenue for the Arts Picturehouse in Cambridge, with whom we intend to work on scheduling screenings of important Latin American science fiction films. 4. Raising awareness of the work of, and generating visitors for, the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, where we intend to hold the exhibition and one or two keynote sessions.  5. Raising the profile of Latin American studies within the UK, and of UK academic research within a global context, by making Oxford and Cambridge the coordinating hubs for a number of events related to the network, and bringing international participants to the UK for two international symposia. We also hope to attract future overseas applicants for Master's and PhD programmes at UK universities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013029%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project aims to explore attitudes towards the arts and cultural value amongst 'culturally aware non-attenders' (Winzenried, 2004; Dobson & Pitts, 2012) - the sector of the population who are receptive to arts involvement, but are currently minimally engaged. Three interlinked interview and survey studies will include people who have previously learnt a musical instrument but no longer play, as well as those with an interest in one art form who are unlikely to attend another. For this substantial sector of the population, their perception of the value of the arts is only partially translated into action, making them a potentially rich source of arts advocacy and involvement, if the means can be found to further activate their latent interest. The three studies will take place as follows: Study 1: The violin in the attic - investigating lapsed musical participation This study will focus on amateur musicians, exploring the experiences and attitudes of those who no longer play, and who commonly cite pressures of time, family, and work as having caused them to cease involvement (Pitts, 2005;2012). Through in-depth interviews with around 30 'lapsed' members of musical groups, this study will explore how the benefits and costs of musical participation are articulated by those who no longer actively participate, and will identify the factors in causing participants to cease their involvement. These findings will shed new light on cultural value as perceived by those who have other priorities in their lives, and will help to propose strategies for retaining and re-engaging such people as active participants. Study 2: Loyalty and its limitations - exploring cultural value across art forms This large-scale questionnaire study will explore the articulation of cultural value across genres, by questioning those who attend a narrow range of arts events about their experiences of their chosen genre, and their broader understanding of arts in society. Responses will be sought from audiences in a range of venues, including independent cinema, theatre, concert halls and museums; each will be asked about their frequency of attendance, factors in choices of events, openness to other art forms, and attitudes towards less familiar arts. The study will therefore highlight any differences between the attitudes and experiences of audiences at specific arts events - and so shed light on whether 'cultural value' is generic to arts engagement, or needs to be more subtly defined for different audiences. Study 3: Cultural value in lives and localities This study will return to the in-depth interview approach used in Study 1, so allowing for comparisons between lapsed arts participants and occasional arts attenders, as well as deepening the evidence from Study 2 with a closer exploration of how attitudes and patterns of engagement are formed in adult life. Around 30 volunteers from Study 2 will be interviewed using a life history approach (cf. Pitts, 2012) to explore their level of past engagement, and how this has shaped their perceptions of the contribution of the arts to their life and to the local community. This study therefore offers another perspective on the factors that promote and inhibit involvement in the arts, and on the articulation of cultural value that surrounds those participation decisions.  The project will generate data and discussion of academic interest (to be published in at least two journals of different related disciplines) and of practical value to arts organisations (to be reported through the Sheffield Performer and Audience Research Centre website - http://www.sparc.dept.shef.ac.uk/). Findings will be reported back to arts organisations, local government and Arts Council representatives, so fulfilling the aims of the AHRC agenda on a local, social scale as well as through contribution to academic debate.","In addition to the academic beneficiaries of this research, other users of the research will include arts organisations, seeking up to date information about a traditionally hard to reach sector of their audiences, and amateur performing groups, who will gain understanding of the factors that cause members to cease involvement. The main impact of the research will therefore be in its provision of a substantial body of empirical evidence on contemporary attitudes to the arts, generated by a group whose currently minimal involvement has the potential to be converted into more substantial engagement.  Arts organisations will therefore gain understanding of: - How their cultural offers are perceived and received by occasional audience members, both within their own genre and through comparisons with others - What the factors are that inhibit greater engagement in the arts, and how these might be overcome through changes to current marketing, presentation and/or audience consultation - How cultural value is perceived and articulated by the 'partially engaged' sector of society, and how this might be strengthened or challenged by arts organisations in the future  Specific beneficiaries will therefore include: - Directors, promoters and marketing managers of arts organisations, who will gain a clearer understanding of their potential audiences and ways to communicate with them - Arts educators, seeking to promote lifelong arts engagement in their students, who will understand the factors in sustaining or ceasing arts involvement - Local and national government, who can be provided with evidence for the benefits of the arts and with strategies for increasing engagement and so supporting the cultural economy - Artists and audience members themselves, who will benefit from a clearer articulation of the value of the arts, and the potential to increase engagement in future audiences Through dissemination and implementation of the research findings - achieved through web resources, seminars and publications - improvements could therefore be made to the effectiveness of arts organisations and cultural policy, so enhancing the quality of life for citizens who are persuaded to engage more fully with the arts. Educators, arts funders, and arts organisations will be equipped with clearer evidence for the social and wellbeing benefits of their activities, and encouraged to articulate cultural value more clearly. Some of these benefits will be immediate, for those organisations and individuals who take part in the research; others will be disseminated by the end of the project through online resources and reports; and longer-term changes to marketing and audience engagement will take one or two years to implement. The data collection tools of the project will equip arts organisations and professionals to update their qualitative audience insight a regular basis, so enhancing existing audience development strategies and improving the quality and reach of the organisations' work.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL005476%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project seeks to better understand the humanitarian impact of continued forcible transfer of the Bedouin communities living in E1, Jerusalem, and how impunity for violations of international law contributes to the deterioration of humanitarian vulnerabilities. Through qualitative enquiry, combining desk based research and first hand semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, the project will gather together a significant body of evidence to highlight to ongoing deleterious impact of repeated violations of IHL (and impunity for violations) on those living at the sharp edge of the situation in Israel-Palestine, namely the Bedouin communities of E1.  In their 2017 report, Humanitarian Facts and Figures: Occupied Palestinian Territory, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted that forced displacement is listed as one of the four key drivers of humanitarian vulnerability. The report highlighted that, ""between 2009 and 2016, Israeli authorities demolished or seized over 4,800 Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank, mostly in Area C and East Jerusalem"". It further indicated that ""46 Palestinian Bedouin communities in the central West Bank, home to some 8,000 Palestinians, the majority registered Palestine refugees, have been targeted by the Israeli authorities for ""relocation"" to a number of designated sites"". The expansion of Israeli settlements, considered illegal and condemned as a ""flagrant violation under international law"" by UN Security Council resolution 2334 of 2016, has been a driver for confiscation of Palestinian private and public land, demolition of homes (including Bedouin shacks) and repeated displacement of Palestinian civilians. The confiscation and demolition of property in Bedouin villages, and the ensuing forcible transfer/relocation of these vulnerable communities, is recognised as a violation of IHL and human rights by the UN, EU and other international actors. Forced displacement of civilians in an occupied territory is also considered a crime under International Criminal Law. The planned expansion of the 'Ma'ale Adumim' settlement block east of Jerusalem is exacerbating the humanitarian vulnerabilities of the Bedouin and herder communities in the E1 area. Bedouin communities such as those residing in Abu Al-Nuwwar, Wadi Abu Hindi, Al Khan Al-Ahmar, Jabal Al-Baba and Sath Al Bahar are at the front line of defence for resisting Israeli settlement expansion, thus ensuring Palestinian access to Jerusalem. This scenario does not just affect individual Bedouin villages at risk of demolition and transfer, but carries grave implications for the broader Israeli-Palestinian situation. Thus, Palestinian Bedouin at risk of forcible transfer have, unintentionally, become key players in the regional context, whilst simultaneously facing unique humanitarian vulnerabilities that must be better understood.  A number of Israeli policies and practices in those areas, including a restrictive permit and planning regime, demolitions and threats of demolitions of property and the active promotion of relocation plans all contribute to the coercive environment, ""which generates pressure on Palestinians to leave their communities"". In the Israeli-Palestinian context, impunity for violations of international law, including IHL, has been recognised as a ""driver of conflict"". In espousing the benefits of holding violators of IHL to account, it has been noted that, ""effective accountability not only ensures that perpetrators are brought to justice, but also ensures that victims have access to remedies and serves to deter future violations and to try to repair the harm suffered."" As such, it is vital to understand the impact of violations of IHL on the Bedouin and herder communities in Palestine, and engage with the ICC's work. This project will work fill this gap, and produce an edited book and policy report.","Who will benefit for the research? There are three key beneficiaries of this research  (a) local groups and individuals facing humanitarian protection risks, namely Bedouin communities, including women and teenagers identified as specific vulnerable groups therein, whose improved capacity to understand, collect evidence of, and communicate issues and experiences illustrating IHL violations will enable greater participation in international accountability efforts, including at the ICC;  (b) in-country researchers and practitioners, in addition to the project partners, whose greater coordination and access to updated analysis will improve the efficiency, effectiveness and timeliness of engagement with international accountability efforts, including at the ICC; and  (c) the international community, including the State of Palestine, acting responsibly in line with the peace and security aims of the UN Charter, including accountability and guarantees of non-recurrence for violations of international humanitarian law through appropriate international legal fora (such as the ICC and UN, as well as the EU and other key players). All of this will maximize humanitarian protection of the Bedouin at risk of forced displacement by responding to past abuse by ensuring accountability for violations before an independent and impartial tribunal, building an environment founded on international law and conducive to full respect of all human rights, and offering some remedy to affected communities by acknowledging harm, seeking justice and empowering local groups to tell their story and be heard.    How will they benefit? Each group will benefit from the planned activities by way of capacity building. And in particular, the Bedouin community will be in a stronger position to engage with the ICC preliminary examination activities.  In line with the overall purpose and aims of the AHRC-DFID humanitarian protection research grant, and as detailed in pathways to impact, this project offers potential impact in policymaking, practitioner and development contexts by addressing the IHL violations affecting Palestinian Bedouin at risk from the ground up, involving and building capacity of the communities affected, working with local researchers and practitioners and engaging with the preliminary examination activities at the ICC, UN and EU. Palestinian Bedouin at risk of forcible transfer have, unintentionally, become key players in the regional context, whilst simultaneously facing unique humanitarian vulnerabilities that must be better understood to enable and unlock the development potential of Palestine. The impact, in line with the primary aim of this project, seeks to mitigate in the long term the significant and specific humanitarian challenges faced by the Palestinian Bedouin at risk of displacement in E1, with a view to reducing harm through an increased respect for international law. The specific humanitarian challenges underpin these communities' possibilities for development as well, as illustrated by a range of UN reports and other sources (see Case for Support). As such, this research project on the E1 Bedouin speaks directly to the international community's commitment to development in Palestine, and commitment to peace and justice in the region.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT007540%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              For thousands of years and across the globe, humans have painted images in caves and on other stone surfaces. Some painted sites were later revisited by people who added new paintings on top of the older. Such sites can be very colourful, complex assemblages of paintings placed one on top the other, so much so that it can be very difficult to discern the sequence of painting over very long periods of time. While archaeologists have developed many sophisticated theories to interpret these paintings, and pieces of the paintings that have fallen off may be recovered to analyze in a laboratory, until recently it has been very difficult to analyse the paintings using powerful scientific equipment while the paintings remain on the rock surface. However, technolgoical advances have produced small transportable devices which now allow for detailed on site analyses that do not harm the paintings. These non-destructive portable technologies can scan the cave, rock-surface, and paintings in 3-Dimensions; can use X-ray technology to determine the chemical elements used to make the pigment that makes the painting; laser instruments to identify organic components of the paintings; and can use portable digital photography to reveal hidden layers normally barely perceptible to the human eye. Unravelling the Gordian Knot Project will apply all of these methods to analyze the spectacular and colourful paintings at the site called Pleito, found in California, USA. Pleito is one of the most complex painted sites in the world. It has hundreds of individual paintings with many colours, including different shades of red, black, white, yellow, orange, green, and blue. This is the widest colour palette of any known site in North American and, importantly, it has multiple panels where paintings have been placed over earlier ones. This kind of overpainting, known as superimposition, presents the greatest challenge to rock-art researchers in their attempts to understand painted art found in the landscape. Even though such complex paintings are challenging, they offer to the archaeologist who can unravel the sequence the greatest chance of understanding the development of paintings through time. Within the site of Pleito, a panel known to researchers as the 'Gordian Knot' is the most elaborate panel found there, making it one of the most complex prehistoric panels found anywhere in the world. The name of this project is derived from this panel, and so Pleito and its complex sequences of overpainting executed in various colours is an ideal case to disentangle the history of painting events. The method employed will integrate a range of portable technologies including portable X-Ray Fluorescence, portable Raman Spectroscopy, Highlight Reflectance Transformation, dStretch digital photography, and portable digital laser scanning to unravel the sequence of painting that makes up one of the most complex sites found anywhere in the world. These techniques will help address questions concerning traditions of pigment use and give insights into the role of the art within Native society. The project includes a state-of-the-art website with a 3-D recreation to be housed at the California State University, Channel Islands, offering an alternative to site visitation as a means to experience the site without risk of damaging the ancient paintings. Also, a new conditional assessment will compare degradation of the site to a 2003 baseline report to see how much of the paintings have recently eroded away: finally, a series of experiments combining different pigments with different types of binding agents will give us material to test with both lab based and portable equipment in the creation of a spectral database: this will give us a series of different chemical readings to compare with the actual paintings and allow researchers across the world to compare results from their discoveries with the Gordian Knot Spectral Databasee","The Gordian Knot Project will have impact across a wide range of different audiences: Website: This website will be a vehicle for impact including A) Virtual Reality Remote Site Experience; B) Multiple Narrative Viewpoints; C) Spectral Database access; D) Native American Voices; and E) Management Options. This website will be designed with will include a virtual reality 3-D model of the site and the rock-art, and maintained at the California State University, Channel Islands. Derived from the 3-D scan data, layer separation graphics from Photoshop, and data from the pXRF and pRaman, a virtual reality model complete with specific dropdown menu options for panels, sequences, and individual element compositions will be created. Individual panels and the layers comprising them will be able to be explored, with chemical descriptions in lay and technical terms provided. This will allow for anyone with internet access the opportunity for a virtual experience of the site without the potential harm to the paintings that physical access risks. The inclusion of two optional narratives: one a lay narrative, the other containing the technical data, will allow for users with different needs and levels of knowledge to comprehend the results of the project. Equally, the site will house the Gordian Knot Spectral Database - a comprehensive list of the results of the spectral work which will be usable for researchers across the globe. With its permanent housing, future data will be able to be added, thus making it an expandable data base and add lasting project legacy. Another feature of the site will include a Native Americans Voices page, thus providing a venue for this important stakeholder group that often does not find a place in academic research for input: this section will include voice and video interviews with the local Native American groups to promote indigenous perspectives on the site and its importance within local traditions. Conservation ethos: The main ethos of the website will be to promote conservation and long term care of Pleito as an example of a precious, world class rock-art site to promote long term changes in the attitudes of the general populace in terms of site preservation. This ethos reflects the Wind Wolves Preserve mission statements of preservation and conservation of the natural environment. The website will also act as a management tool to mitigate visitation while promoting the long term aim of preservation of both the site and other archaeological sites found on its property. The Gordian Knot Project will also provide a site management plan to the Wind Wolves Preserve in order to more fully protect Pleito in the long term. In 2003, the Rock Art Documentation Group (RAD Group) published a technical conditional assessment of the pictographs and the host rock. The RAD Group will work with The Gordian Knot project as consultants to reassess the site: this will give us an assessment of the potential damage that has occurred to the site in the intervening decade. Robinson and Perry have extensive experience with Cultural Resource Management reports and the site will edited the final report before submission to the Wind Wolves Preserve. The report will include management recommendations for the long term preservation of the site. In addition, the project will produce a pamphlet outlining the archaeology of the Preserve and the importance of conservation for a younger, non-academic audience. This pamphlet will be written by Robinson and Perry, and will include. A pdf of the brochure will be provided for the preserve so that it may use in its educational program. The project will work closely with B&W Tec to aid in the refinement of future portable spectral technologies. A white paper outlining this will be made freely available on the Gordian Knot Website and we will apply for further funding to host a conference to reach a broad spectrum of UK professionals.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM008894%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Human rights are about the brute moral minimum. They identify the minimum level of decent treatment we owe to each other as human beings. Over the past two decades, philosophers, political theorists, and legal theorists have turned their collective attention to the analysis of human rights. But, they have focused their attention largely on a subset of our civil and political rights, such as our rights to participate politically, to have free expression, to practice a religion, to assemble together for political purposes, and to be safe from torture, as well as on a small set of our socio-economic welfare rights, such as our rights to be free from poverty, to health, and to education.  International agreements enumerate a range of other rights, however, which have received considerably less analytic attention from human rights theorists. Among these enumerated rights are, notably, our interpersonal, social rights, such as the rights to marry, to be protected in parent-child relationships, and to share in the benefits of our society's scientific and cultural advancements. The elucidation of these rights makes little mention of either the goods of friendship or more general rights to have ongoing, close human contact beyond the family unit.  There are signs that policymakers are beginning to take our interpersonal needs seriously. The UK government, for one, has made a material commitment to combating loneliness and social isolation, through a £20 million investment and the appointment of a Minister (Tracey Crouch) tasked with implementing the government's cross-party work on these issues. This background environment provides an ideal setting for this network to produce timely and impactful research on social human rights.  Some key questions to ask at the outset are whether the social rights enumerated in international agreements hold up to analytic scrutiny, and whether human rights offer a good conceptual apparatus with which to frame our social needs and ensure they are met. Other important questions are whether any key social rights have been missed in legalistic debates about human rights, and whether social rights would require society to rethink radically its policies within sectors such as criminal justice, health, and immigration, which are often sites of forced segregation and social malnourishment.  Through a programme of activities including an open conference, research retreat, and stakeholder meetings, this network of internationally renowned philosophers, political theorists, legal theorists, and rising stars will investigate these and other questions. Network members represent a range of conflicting views on the status of social human rights. Some hold that the centrality of social needs to our wellbeing means that the language of duties and obligations attendant to rights-discourse is indeed the correct framework to adopt. Others are unconvinced that such an approach is feasible, and argue that discussions of social rights overstep the boundaries of what rights-discourse can hope to achieve. The contest of these perspectives will inform and underpin the project's edited collection and the other outputs that will emerge from the network's activities.  By foregrounding our social natures in discussions of our needs, obligations and duties, either within or beyond a rights-centred framework, we can develop our understanding of the political and legal structures that shape our relations with other people. If, for example, a person is systematically excluded from associations with other people as a result of others' free choices, what support, if any, does society owe her? In addition, what other processes within our social world generate situations where our social needs go unmet? It is in opening up these questions, and shedding light on what emerges as a consequence of taking our constitutively social nature seriously, that this network intends to make its mark.","In response to the final report of the Jo Cox Commission in December 2017, the UK government has made a material commitment to combating loneliness and social isolation, through a £20 million investment and the appointment of a Minister (Tracey Crouch) tasked with implementing the government's cross-party work on these issues. Many charities, including the Campaign to End Loneliness, a collaborating organisation in this AHRC Network application, are working at the heart of the government-led process to tackle the loneliness epidemic in Britain. Several other countries, particularly in Europe and North America, are looking to the UK as a model to tackle their own growing numbers of lonely or isolated people.  This background environment provides an ideal setting for this network to produce highly impactful research on social needs and social rights. This is particularly true given that the empirical facts around loneliness and social isolation are becoming increasingly well known, but their normative force is not. Loneliness and unwanted social isolation can result in poor bodily and mental health, including increased risk of heart disease, depression, arthritis, alcoholism, type 2 diabetes, and dementia. Loneliness is also expensive for governments: treatment costs the NHS £6,000 (approx.) per person for a decade of an older person's life. Once we understand how acute loneliness and persistent unwanted isolation can implicate key human rights, we can better combat their social, political, health, and economic effects. The network, which includes leading figures in human rights debates, will provide a normative framework to understand our basic interpersonal social needs, which will help to tackle dimensions of the 'loneliness epidemic' currently taking its toll on millions of people in the UK and throughout the world. The network's research ultimately aims to influence public debate and key stakeholders' activities and, thereby, benefit the providers and users of services that support people who are especially vulnerable to loneliness and unwanted isolation, such as elderly people, children, people with disabilities, migrants, and people convicted for criminal offences. Impact on campaign groups, NGOs, and policymakers will be key to the achievement of this fundamental aim. Such stakeholders will be directly engaged in the network from the outset to ensure that its outputs will specifically address the challenges faced by these groups in confronting issues of loneliness and unwanted social isolation.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS011013%2F1

Such non-clinical approaches are gaining added resonance in the mental health care sector due to their proactive, preventive qualities, and the opportunities created to provide strategically 'joined up' services across a range of cross-sector organisations. Within the Liverpool city region, there are many examples of hugely effective arts-based interventions and initiatives in mental health care, spear-headed by Mersey Care NHS Trust and leading arts and cultural organisations including National Museums Liverpool, Tate Liverpool and The Reader Organisation. The proposed network seeks to build upon the learning outcomes generated by these initiatives and associated research programmes to inform the strategic development of arts-based social prescribing in the city, including a co-produced policy framework for participating organisations, and an accompanying 'how-to' guide for applied research on the arts and social prescribing in mental health. This will be achieved via a series of themed research development workshops, with participants drawn from academia and relevant policy and practice communities. The regional model will then be used to inform national debate and policy development during a conference event to be held at the end of the funded period.","As a research network funded under a public policy highlight notice, there are a number of communities of practice and interest, outside of academia, who will be invited to participate in and potentially benefit from the activities and outcomes of the proposed project. These include but are not limited to: Cultural organisations and practitioners: with arts and cultural interventions (within the context of a public policy concern) as its focus, the network will be of significant interest to arts and cultural sectors, especially those practitioners with an interest in arts and mental health; participation and engagement; instrumentalism and cultural policy; the social, cultural and economic impact of cultural action and intervention. Mental health care agencies and service providers: the network will make a considerable contribution to continuing debates on the relationship between arts and mental health and wellbeing, and will be of interest to health practitioners, rehabilitation workers and social service providers with professional experience in this area.  Cultural policy and advocacy agencies: bodies such as Arts Council England and the Department for Culture Media and Sport are key stakeholders in the proposed discussions, especially in relation to debates on cultural value and long-term socio-economic impacts of cultural action and interventions. A dedicated research programme of this nature should have significant cross-party interdepartmental appeal. Local and national government: furthermore, due to its relationship with a number of government objectives (and associated learning outcomes) as identified above, applicants will endeavour to engage local and national government representatives with the network and its findings, to help shape national and international policy on arts and mental health, and cultural value more broadly. Other potential interested parties include charities, voluntary groups and third sector organisations working in communities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL015455%2F1

The application proposes the creation of a new national organisation for UK documentary - the Documentary Film Council (DFC) - that has been co-conceived by the research team in collaboration with the leading organisations in the industry.  The DFC will consist of a range of working groups that address the different needs and represent the different sub-sectors in the documentary industry. The specific aim of this project is to target Follow-on Funding at key elements of this proposed organisational infrastructure: the core work required to establish the DFC, and the specific activities of its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and Mental Health working groups. This strategic use of funds will directly support the foundations of the DFC and address two of the most pressing industry-wide issues - diversity and mental health - while also animating the DFC's broader organisational infrastructure and stimulating activity across all the DFC's proposed working groups.    The UKFD project was primarily a work of cultural history that explored the evolution of documentary as a cinematic form over the past two decades. However, the project also included a more future-facing research strand that aimed to investigate the challenges faced by those working in the sector today. This strand of the project expanded well beyond its original scope following high levels of stakeholder engagement and the formation of close relationships with leading industry bodies. As the research developed, it emerged that policymakers in the film and television industries alike had, for various reasons, largely overlooked the unique needs of the nonfiction sector. As a result, UK documentary was suffering from a range of problems that stemmed from a long-standing lack of tailored support. This work thus exposed an urgent and unforeseen need for widespread policy intervention across the documentary industry. Responding to this need, the UKFD research team scaled-up their originally modest plans to explore challenges in the sector. In partnership with Doc Society - the lead body for documentary in England - and with additional 0.4 RA support, funded by UWE in recognition of this expanded remit, in April 2019 the UKFD team launched what became the largest survey ever conducted of UK documentary producers and directors. The results were published by the UKFD team in June, which in turn became the basis for an extensive sector-wide consultation in summer and autumn 2020, the results of which were published in a second major UKFD report in January 2021.  This Follow-On Funding bid is the product of this unanticipated and unforeseeable research trajectory. The proposed project builds on the original UKFD research and takes it in a significant, innovative and exciting new direction. The proposed structure and reach of the DFC is without precedent in the UK screen sector. It will generate a range of creative, innovative and evidence-based interventions across the documentary industry, and will attract national and international attention, engaging a genuinely diverse range of new audiences and user communities. As evidenced by the UKFD project research, many of the issues and challenges facing the documentary industry can only be addressed via sustained and collective commitment to the problems at hand. A secure and sustainable cross-sector infrastructure is a precondition to building and maintaining such commitment. With support from the AHRC at this crucial stage, this project will provide that infrastructure to the UK documentary sector, delivering significant cultural, economic and social benefits to the sector and its audiences and ensuring the impact of AHRC-funded research is felt across the UK screen sector and beyond for years to come.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW011352%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The aim of this project is to explore how an expanded account of community - one which recognises the active participation of non-humans - might contribute to our understandings of how research can be co-designed and co-produced.  It arises from a concern that 'community' has too often been thought of as only including the human, thus leaving out the wide range of interactions with non-humans that sustain and enhance our communities. Likewise, 'research' itself appears most often as an activity that is quintessentially human. However, our research practices have always been entangled with the lives, qualities and capacities of non-human actors. From the birds who demonstrated the vacuum in Robert Boyle's air pump, the dogs who demonstrated the effects of insulin and the genetically modified OncoMouse, much research has relied extensively on the contributions of non-humans. Our interest in this project, then, is to explore how both research and community might be rethought within a 'more-than-human' framework. Literature on the coproduction of research with communities emphasises the benefits of attempting to integrate a wide range of perspectives and experiences, arguing that this makes stronger research that is of more benefit to those the research affects.  However, while there is some evidence that, in the context of climate change and biodiversity loss, proponents of participatory research have begun to recognise a need to extend the paradigm beyond the human communities it has focused on, this has not yet occurred. As a result, this project will initiate an exploration into the possibilities of co-designing research with more-than-human communities. We will do this through staging four 'conversations' with non-human actors and the humans who work with them. We are interested in exploring issues to do with power, voice and agency and so will seek to test the boundaries of 'polite conversation' by working with dogs, bees, trees and water. Reflections on these workshops will be available from our website and we will produce an analysis of the opportunities and challenges of such an approach. We will also produce a peer-reviewed article that will extend the literature on co-production and co-design in this new direction.","This project takes place in a context of mass species extinction, extensive habit loss, climate change, and resource depletion. At its heart is the conviction that, while dominant research paradigms have undoubtedly given rise to remarkable improvements in a range of areas, they have nonetheless failed to address how our changing societies might remain within sustainable limits. One concrete example of the effects of failing to consider more-than-human communities within research is the drastic decline of vultures in East Asia, where over 99% of the population have died from acute reactions to diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug given to cattle. Over and above the consequences for the vultures themselves, the increasing amounts of carrion available, (which was previously eaten by the vultures), has led to an exploding feral dog population, which in turn has led to tens of thousands of rabies cases in humans, as well as increases in other diseases. There have also been cultural losses for Zoroastrian communities who have had to find alternative funeral methods. This cascade of effects, which has very real consequences for humans, is partly due to inadequate research methods around drug testing that do not take broader contexts into account. What this suggests is that the impacts of transforming research practices so that they operate within a paradigm of more-than-human communities are potentially immense. However, shifting conventional research paradigms, many of which remain embedded within Enlightenment philosophies of self-aware humans in a machine-like world, is not a task to be taken at all lightly. Thus while we would like to situate our project within this broader context, we have more modest hopes for our work in this project. Specific beneficiaries of the research will include the organisations and arts practitioners involved. They are particularly interested in reflecting on how this approach might develop their work in new ways. Their accounts of the benefits of this research will then be disseminated through their wider networks including the British Beekeepers Association and the National Association for Areas of Natural Outstanding Beauty. More widely the novel application of the coproduction paradigm promises to be useful for many working on the intertwining of human and nonhuman communities. For example, these approaches could feed into long standing and acrimonious debates within conservation movements which can pitch local human communities and nonhuman interests in direct opposition to each other. Given the wide range of interests in issues to do with dogs and service work, bees and their current decline, trees and risks to current national forests, and increased risks of flooding and rising sea levels we believe our research will be of further interest to a broad community and so will seek to disseminate the results of our project through a variety of means including through our website but also at events such as the Bristol Festival for Nature, who we are in discussions with at the moment.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK006517%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The proposed network brings together scholars from across different disciplines (arts, humanities, social and physical sciences; see Academic Beneficiaries), creative writers, business strategists and policy makers to investigate the presence and role of concepts of fate, luck and fortune (hereafter FLF) in discussions of environmental risks, to develop a nuanced understanding of the variety of ways in which, in different historical and geographical contexts, concepts of FLF have played a role or roles in perceptions and expressions of risk, and responses to it, and continue to do so.    In modern post-enlightenment western culture, risk tends to be described in terms of quantification. Setting FLF side-by-side with risk may seem incongruous: it has been argued that the idea of risk is what differentiates the modern era; risk management has become an arena of expertise, and specialised education and training. However, it is now widely accepted that people respond less to objective information about risks and take more notice of their own perceptions of danger, shaped by the implicit assumptions of their particular culture, including the role of FLF; nevertheless, these conceptions and the role that they play in shaping decision-making are rarely if ever made explicit and addressed.    This network aims to provide a systematic overview of the ways in which concepts of FLF have been, and continue to be expressed in historical, contemporary and futuristic narratives concerned with environmental risk, for example, from ancient Greek dedications to the goddess tuche ('Chance'), to contemporary climate change fiction. Such an exploration will not only bring insights from other cultures, but also provide new perspectives on contemporary narratives of environmental risk-with the potential to reconsider current approaches to responses to environmental risk.    There are three planned workshops addressing the following themes:  - Historicising the role of FLF, providing scholars who study environmental risks with clarification of the development of these ideas and their use in this context; - Developing new policy approaches, exploring how a more thorough understanding of the role of FLF in narratives of environmental risk may be used to develop new responses in current policy;  - The popularisation of FLF, exploring the ways in which conceptions of FLF (or personifications of abstract powers) remain powerful in historical and current discourses (visual, written and oral) concerned with environmental risks, and how they shape perceptions of agency. The project aims to provide insights that that will develop beyond the usual assumptions about environmental risks, gaining new perspectives, developing new questions and approaches to data, working with new evidence and methodologies. This will be achieved by bringing together the heuristic tools of different disciplines across the arts and humanities, sciences and social sciences. The network will also include participants from a broad range of publics and key stakeholders, including those working at the science - policy interface, in business, but also in the creative arts. As well as helping to develop a shared arena of research, the network aims to contribute to relevant public and policy conversations concerning the nature and role of fate luck and fortune in contemporary society, and in attitudes to environmental risks.","Research into the nature of environmental risk--and responses to it--is becoming increasingly urgent. Scientific communities tend to focus on quantifiable aspects of risks, which inform public policy narratives. But the role played by underlying beliefs concerned with fate, luck and fortune (FLF)--informed by historical developments and cultural norms--is rarely examined; and although the role of public and/or popular narratives is increasingly being recognised as offering insights that can aid risk management and the crafting of public policy, how to integrate them remains a key question.    This project seeks to bring together the findings from across the arts, humanities, social science and science arenas to examine how popular beliefs of FLF have shaped and continue to influence perceptions of agency in contexts of environmental risk. It will draw on the expertise of those creating popular narratives concerned with environmental risks, as well as those working with such narratives in business and government.  1. Public impact: Results will be disseminated across academic disciplines, but also to a wider audience, with the aim of raising awareness of the role of FLF in public and popular narratives concerned with environmental risk. Working with the Nottingham Writers' Studio and professional writers, and using social media, and a public lecture, we hope not only to invite the public to explore, but also to develop, new narratives of environmental risk. We aim to identify ways in which such narratives might be better integrated into the development of appropriate environmental risk communication strategies, and so to shape public and popular debate about responses to environmental risk.  We therefore envisage impacts across four additional key sectors:  2. Creative arts: Alongside its analytical focus, the project's explicit discussion of FLF as a crucial but often implicit aspect of narrative will offer a rich vein of material for artists to integrate into their creative work. Through collaboration with the Nottingham Writers' Studio and invited writers and artists, the project will inspire both immediate creative and artistic outputs and longer-term collaborations; these will also encourage reflection on the role of FLF in shaping responses to environmental risks.  3. Policy: Understanding the implications of beliefs in FLF is essential for the creation of effective policy. Individuals working in or with policy-making within international and national government or in fields or with constituencies affected by environmental risks have agreed to participate in the project. Historical case studies presented at the meetings will not only provide a long-term perspective on the significance of FLF beliefs, but also offer 'neutral territory' for examining contemporary concerns. The aim is to develop understanding of underlying beliefs (among both the public and the policymakers) that continue to influence environmental risk perception.  4. Business: The use of 'scenarios' for strategic planning means that narrative can play a crucial role in business strategy. Through participation in the project of members of corporate strategic teams and strategic consultants, the project will engage with those who shape current business strategies; this will aid exploration of the role of FLF in the formation and audiences of business strategy.  5. Education: education can play an important role in creating an environmental risk-literate society. We aim to reach the educational sector by working directly with schools, as well as through social media. In addition, the Co-I's links with the Royal Geographical Society-Institute of British Geographers will enable further dissemination of the outcomes of this research; finally, through the participation of representatives of government, the project aims to impact educational policy.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN006062%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Making clothing is a fundamentally corporeal experience. Yet histories of dress, textiles, and manufacture often lack awareness or acknowledgement of the physicality of garment making. Such processes were rarely captured in text, and extant material objects usually only represent the finished product. The Making Historical Dress Network will bring into conversation and flatten traditional hierarchies between a diverse range of scholars and practitioners who have recognised this lacuna and taken to their needles to recapture practical sewing knowledge of the past. Through these 'embodied' approaches, garment construction can be reverse engineered, lost skills can be recovered, and instructions and diagrams can be tested. Recreative methods push back against the narratives of professionalised and masculine production, which dominate the archive. Attention to historic practices of manual making offers a mouthpiece to labourers, particularly women and BAME makers, who are often obscured in guild records and industrialist accounts. Vitally, recreation recovers the manual skills devalued by present-day fast fashion. It illuminates and retrieves the physical human labour required to make clothing, which historic narratives around and current practices of mass manufacture have diminished. Experimental methodologies are well established in disciplines such as archaeology and technical art history but have only recently gained traction amongst historians, as recreation and practical approaches have often remained outside the academy. The recent 'making' and 'embodied' turns, led largely by dress historians, have asked scholars to consider how these objects interacted with and were formed by historical bodies. Existing scholarship, such as the work of Arnold and Tiramani in Theatrical Costume Studies and Hohti Erichsen and Pitman in History, has been fragmented along disciplinary and professional lines. However, this approach has gained accelerated traction amongst scholars following the launch of Tiramani's School of Historical Dress in 2012 and Davidson's 2019 article. Simultaneously, the growth of historical recreation on YouTube and Instagram since 2018 (recognised as a fashion phenomenon by Vogue in 2021) has created a global community of historical makers, who generate knowledge outside of the academy. Despite the field's growth, there is little cohesion or field-wide acceptance of key terms and methods. Research in this field has been undertaken by scholars and practitioners fragmented across the UK, USA, Europe, and Australia, working on different periods, or employed outside traditional academic institutions. The Making Historical Dress Network will unite established and emerging scholars of dress across the disciplines of History, Literature, Art History, and Cultural Studies with practitioners in the worlds of costume production, curation, and conservation, as well as the social media community of historical costumers. In doing so, the network will provide a forum for the discussion and establishment of a shared fundamental rubric for the field. The network will address the lack of diversity within the field, a particular challenge for the academy, by illuminating the work of diverse and enslaved makers of the past and raising up the voices of BAME practitioners. This network will consolidate existing fragmented work, co-create knowledge with non-academic practitioners, and enable participants to establish field-defining best practice.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX007790%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will examine a dialogue about death and dying between the clinical and historical disciplines. The aim of the project is two-fold: to demonstrate tangibly how archaeology can inform our current attitudes to death and dying, and thereby help shape policy and practice; and to explore the value of collaboration between health care professionals and archaeologists. The diverse methods of dealing with death and the dead uncovered by archaeologists will bring a different perspective to our current attitudes and therefore contribute towards a necessary re-examination of today's taboo status of death as an inevitable human experience. Death is rarely discussed in everyday life mostly for fear of the emotions it raises. This has considerable consequences for individuals and families in decision-making in illness and frailty of old age. The fundamental hypothesis underpinning this work is that through introducing the topic of death through archaeological examples, discussions of death can become more commonplace, more emotionally detached and hopefully more familiar. Through bringing this topic back into the conversational realm, many fears can be alleviated and practicalities and preferences can be discussed. Through creating a compendium of insights into death through time, particularly the fundamental resonance of bereavement, loss and commemoration, the project will shape thinking on how contemporary practice and historical perspectives can be mutually informed. It offers a more enlightened approach to a fundamental and inevitable moment in our human lives. The project will test out this approach with both lay audiences and with students and professionals in health, social and spiritual care, including nursing students, spiritual care practitioners, counsellors, and medical students. It will seek to use materials to prompt reflection and examination of participants' own familial and cultural approaches to death, commemoration and continuing bonds with those that have died. It will also draw on the past to explore the concept of ancestors, and how this relates to contemporary considerations of legacy, continuing bonds, and the prospect of ourselves as ancestors of future generations. This will be achieved through a series of thematic workshops with the stakeholder groups and an action research approach, with each workshop informing future workshops, as well as working towards an exhibition intended for the public. Stakeholder workshops will run in conjunction with two 'Dying Awareness Week' events on the theme of Continuing Bonds, which will include a public audience, and will be the primary dissemination event for exhibition materials. Towards the close of the project, an exploratory workshop will be held with secondary teachers, to assess the viability of introducing material into schools as part of a 'Death Education', with this the focus of work beyond the current project.  The project will provide a foundation for further interdisciplinary approaches to fundamental issues of life and death, demonstrating how disciplines which are apparently diverse can aid, inform, and mutually benefit from each other. This project builds on an existing programme of research undertaken by the PI and CoIs, which has developed networks between archaeology and healthcare, and explored the ideas raised here with stakeholders, including palliative nurses, spiritual care practitioners, and academics in health care, receiving overwhelming support for project development. A successful pilot workshop has also taken place, organised by CoI(1) during Dying Awareness Week (May 2014), where the PI delivered a keynote lecture. The networks and support for this research are in place and growing, creating an exciting and new interdisciplinary approach to attitudes to death, dying, legacy, and memory, and a tangible demonstration of the impact of humanities research.","Who will benefit from this research? 1) Public sector groups, including health-care professionals, spiritual care practitioners, counsellors and teachers 2) The Dying Matters coalition 3) Policy-making bodies around NHS and care settings 4) Wider public How will they benefit from this research? 1) The project will inform the practice of nurses and other healthcare professionals in their work with dying patients and their families, improving confidence though an increased understanding of historical and cultural approaches to death, legacy and memory. Previous research has demonstrated the utility of narratives in enabling healthcare professionals to contextualise grief and loss. Our hypothesis is that an increased understanding of historical and cultural approaches to death, legacy and memory through facilitating exploration and discussion of dying, death, mortuary rituals will help practitioners examine their own attitudes and current practices. This in turn will lead to improved confidence, courage and thereby compassionate care of the dying and their families (DH 2012). A longer term impact will be on secondary teachers: during the final phase of the project, an exploratory meeting will assess the value of the project in working towards a 'Death Education'. 2) The Dying Matters Coalition, who strive to ""help people talk more openly about dying, death and bereavement, and to make plans for the end of life"" (Dying.Matters, 2013), will benefit through the provision of a new and innovative approach to dealing with death, desperately called for by researchers and policy-makers alike (Moon, 2010, DH, 2008, Cox et al., 2013). The establishment of dialogue and discussion about current issues surrounding death are often accompanied by strong emotions and polarised debate; research that informs this discussion using historical narratives based on archaeological findings will provide additional tools to contribute perspective to the discussion. 3) Changes in our stakeholder groups have the potential to inform future policy and planning in terms of treatment of our dying and dead, particularly around teaching medical and nursing professionals, as well as around hospital, hospice, care home and community settings. We anticipate that changes in attitudes will inform policy, planning and practice.  4) The project will contribute to an attitude change towards death and a breakdown of the current taboo of death as a subject, potentially allowing discussion of the topic in a more objective and less emotive way thus enabling people to think about their own death, legacy and bonds with their ancestors, both past and future, through participation in our Continuing Bonds workshops, accessing our project website, and through dissemination events, such as Death Café and Café Scientifique events. This has the potential for broader impact on issues of wellbeing, enabling both better deaths and better life (SGHD 2008). It will also provide new material for public talks and lectures, providing cultural enrichment for those interested in our human past.

The All Our Stories projects that we will be working with focus on oral histories, archive-based research and understanding the built, buried and natural environment. In response, we have put together a project team that can support the needs of the groups with a mix of historians, archaeologists and cultural geographers. With a combination of expertise in political, social and economic history as well as a thorough knowledge of the history and geography of the East Midlands, the research team bring a diverse range of intellectual perspectives which will enhance the capacity of the community partners to understand, interpret and assess their projects in a range of related contexts. In support of the project team, a larger academic body can be called upon to respond to community group needs, with dedicated research time and access to specialist facilities enabled through a Challenge Fund targeted to cover any core costs incurred which cannot be met by the community groups' AOS funding. Our programme of engagement will include three milestone events (launch, mid-term showcase and final showcase) and a programme of enabling workshops focused on the key requirements of the groups as articulated through a consultation process which enabled the Phase 1 project team to identify the key training and skills development needs. This programme will deliver networking and knowledge exchange opportunities between the community groups and between the community groups and non-academic partners and the academic team.   Key to the success of the project are the three Early Career Researchers (Johnson, Mills and Veale) - they will act as direct support for the core projects and the point-of-contact (through a dedicated hotline) for general enquiries from other groups. Working with the NCCPE and other sections of the University (Centre for Advanced Studies, Community Partnerships and Information Services) they will facilitate access to relevant, specialist academic support and University facilities for All Our Stories community groups. The programme will benefit from strong institutional support from the UoN including the Centre for Advanced Studies, Community Partnerships, Information Services and the University Museum. It will also draw on the UoN's non-HEI partners including Nottingham City Museums and Galleries, Derbyshire County Record Office and Trent & Peak Archaeology (part of York Archaeological Trust).  Our programme will be taking place between February and December 2013 to time with the life-cycle of the All Our Stories projects. The benefits of the programme will be the enhancement of existing community-based research, the fostering of new community groups and the co-design of research bids for HLF funding. In the longer term, the programme will build new capacity for academic engagement with volunteer researchers.","As a community-focused project, the proposed programme is inherently geared towards knowledge exchange and impact. Since it aims to enable community groups who are actively involved in research to have greater engagement with academics, its starting-point for planning and evaluating impact is very different from that of the more usual type of research project carried out by academics which seeks to build wider public impact into the project plan. Nevertheless, a number of specific ways can be identified in which the proposed programme will have wider benefits. Firstly, the research process can be envisaged as having a direct and immediate impact on the non-academic researchers involved in terms of the research and professional skills they have the opportunity to acquire. Academic engagement with community groups and their volunteer researchers should enable volunteers to: a) ask broader research questions and develop themes with the potential to enhance more far-reaching analysis, for instance linking together case studies into a larger framework; b) acquire hands-on archaeology techniques including intrusive and non-intrusive survey and sampling techniques, management and analysis of finds; c) develop historical research skills: extracting data from newspapers; map research; using local record offices; accessing documents in The National Archives e.g. poor law records, judicial records, census returns (many now online); d) learn new digital technologies (with input from Information Services and the Digital Humanities Centre); e) record data appropriately, present findings and create research resources: e.g. collecting/recording data 'collectively' to allow searches across the work of a group or several groups; using video and audio equipment to capture testimonies effectively; drafting texts and managing visual images; making the most of a website to communicate research results. Secondly, more indirect benefits can be envisaged arising from the research process. Among those indirectly benefiting from the research would be other staff such as room stewards in museums or heritage sites who will gain from the knowledge disseminated by volunteer researchers. Another group of more indirect beneficiaries are respondents drawn into community research projects whose testimonies are solicited as part of oral history data gathered by the researcher group: respondents, often a generation older than those interviewing them, are generally glad to have their knowledge, opinions and memories taken seriously and captured as part of a research process. Thirdly, the project offers an opportunity to have a positive impact on non-academic bodies such as museums, libraries and archives, and other heritage bodies such as the National Trust, through the development of new links to communities (and potentially new audiences and users), new knowledge and understanding of the holdings and sites cared for by these organisations and an increased capacity in mobilising community groups and academics to participate in future collaborative research projects. Finally, longer-term benefits can arise from the research findings, their dissemination to different audiences, and their potential applicability to current social and economic challenges. Community archaeology and local history typically chart the origins, rise, evolution and decline of particular communities over time: such research can offer clues into what makes communities flourish and how communities adapt, or fail to adapt, to a changing environment. In particular, it is clear that there are contemporary lessons that may be drawn from projects looking at community resilience and adaptation to change with factors such as the demise of a major industry which can lead to social deprivation but also, under certain circumstances to forms of economic regeneration.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007696%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project addresses an urgent issue that has profound effects on humans, animals, and the wider environment, and in which there is high public interest in the UK. The raising of farmed animals is a major global enterprise with massive impacts on domestic and wild animals, human food and water security, human health, and the environment. In 2013, 77 billion birds and mammals and around 6 trillion fish were used for human food globally, using 78% of available agricultural land, consuming 35% of global cereal output, resulting in more greenhouse gas emissions than those from transport globally, and contributing to a wide range of human health problems including antibiotic resistance, zoonotic diseases such as bird and swine flu, and increased incidence of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and stroke from the associated increase in meat consumption. The raising of farmed animals has grown markedly since the mid-20th century, primarily as a result of a revolutionary intensification of production methods. Poultry consumption has increased at three times that of human population growth in each of the past five decades and a 73% rise in demand for meat from 2010 levels is expected by 2050. Progressive intensification in the rearing of farmed animals, high and rising public concern about farmed animal welfare, and uncertainty about UK farmed animal welfare standards post-Brexit make this project timely. Churches and other Christian organizations in the UK have significant interests in and influence over animal farming in the UK, through ownership of agricultural land, investments in food producers and retailers, participation in policy debates, and consumption of animal products, and will therefore play an important role in public debates about farmed animal welfare. It is striking, therefore, that they currently have no policies concerning farmed animal welfare. This project will produce the first substantive academic discussion of the Christian ethics of farmed animal welfare and, by working with national churches and other organizational partners, will resource the development of new policy and influence institutional practice concerning the raising of farmed animals and consumption of products derived from them. It will also provide a new model of how to engage religious groups and other groups with particular commitments and concerns with the ethical implications of new scientific knowledge and its implications for practice. The project will use a collaborative research process between an interdisciplinary research team and institutional partners which will result in (1) a framework for institutional policy and practice; (2) a process for engaging institutions with that framework to enable development of policy and changes in practice; (3) the first academic monograph in the field and related journal outputs. The partners committed to this project are major Christian denominations representing the majority of the Christians in the UK (Church of England, Roman Catholic Church, Church of Scotland, Church in Wales, Methodist Church, and United Reformed Church), the globally leading charity addressing farmed animal welfare (Compassion in World Farming), groups representing farmers and veterinarians, and Christian animals organizations. The range of this collaboration and its potential influence to improve welfare outcomes is remarkable and unprecedented. The project will enable institutional changes in practice that will have substantial implications for farmed animal welfare and a resulting impact on human well-being and the environment. These changes will be enabled through a process that draws on graphic illustrators, a performance artist, and change facilitators, to help institutions appreciate the need for change and the route to achieve it. Beyond the funded period, new institutions will be engaged, and a planned successor project in the US will build on this one to generate even greater impacts.","Short-term impacts (2018-2022) Impact 1: Changed attitudes among dialogue partners Since there has been very little deliberation concerning the implications of Christian ethics for farmed animal welfare, opening a dialogue with the church and NGO partners, farmers, church landowners and investors, and church congregations included in the collaborative research process will provoke new thinking and changed attitudes. Impact 2: New institutional policies and commitments to changed practice The majority of the impact pathways are via the key objective of developing new institutional policies concerning farmed animal welfare and securing institutional commitments to the key priority actions identified in the framework. Within 6 months of the end of the funded period of the project, we aim to have at least 10 organizations developing institutional policies and committed to the key priority actions. The project enables this through a facilitated change workshop for partners, a commissioned report for the Church Investors Group, and recruiting new institutions to engage via the project conference. Follow-on support will be sought to allow the PI to work with institutions beyond the funded period to support them in policy development.  Medium-term impacts (2021-2025) Impact 3: Changed attitudes of church members and wider public The Fairtrade campaign initiated by Christian NGOs in the 1990s, and the recent campaign by the Church of England (CofE) against excessive interest rates charged by payday lenders, are good examples of changes in church policy impacting on the attitudes of church members and the wider public. New church policies in relation to farmed animal welfare will have a similar impact on attitudes, especially where it relates to the practice of congregations (e.g. concerning the consumption of farmed animal products). Impact 4: Influence on public policy debates about farmed animal welfare standards New institutional policy and practice and changed public attitudes will both have an influence on the post-Brexit public policy debates about farmed animal welfare. There will be direct influence through encouraging churches to make contributions to these debates (including the CofE bishops in the House of Lords) and indirect influence, as partner organizations affect the attitudes of their members and the wider public. Long-term impacts (2021 onwards) Impact 5: Fewer farmed animals in intensive systems and growing proportion in high welfare environments While the results of the collaborative research process cannot be predicted in advance, it is uncontroversial that at least some elements of the intensive rearing of farmed animals are in need of remedy and that significant improvements in weIfare are unsustainable at current levels of production. Each of Impacts 1-4 will therefore contribute to reducing the numbers of intensively farmed animals and to increasing the proportion of animals raised in high welfare conditions. Impact 6: Benefits for human health and food/water security, animal welfare, and the environment Reduced numbers of farmed animals (Impact 5) will contribute to mitigating some of the broad impacts of the large-scale intensive farming of animals for human well-being, animal welfare, and the environment (detailed at the start of the Case for Support). Impacts from US successor project Finally, success in achieving changes in institutional policy and practice (Impact 2), together with the framework and academic outputs, will enable an application to US funders for a successor project in the US (target 2023-26), which will have its own pathways to Impacts 1-6 on a significantly greater scale. The US academic observers on this project will be key advisors for this successor project. The Public Policy Program of the Henry Luce Foundation is one potential funding source. Figure 3 in Pathways to Impact depicts the routes to these impacts as a flowchart.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR014752%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Euclid's Elements of Geometry was written in about 300 B.C. in Alexandria on the north coast of Egypt. Its long history of active use and re-use passes through the Arabic and Latin Middle Ages as well as the European Renaissance, and it has been a touchstone for mathematical training as well as a spur to new mathematical research for more than two thousand years. This project looks at Euclid's Elements in Britain and Ireland during the century of the Scientific Revolution, when standards of geometrical proof were being actively questioned by mathematicians, but when geometrical methods were also being deliberately brought into other fields, most obviously natural philosophy.    In the period from 1560 to 1700 dozens of new editions of the Elements were printed, and it was certainly the most widely read mathematical book of the time. We will study these editions and the choices they made - about the content and layout of the Elements, which topics to include and which versions of the proofs to print - to help understand the unique position the book occupied and how that position was shaped and maintained.    We will also study the things people did when they had the Elements in their hands. Some wrote in it; some cut out the diagrams; some pasted in extra material. By looking at many examples we will build up a picture of the kinds of ways early modern people engaged with the Elements - schoolchildren, working men, teachers and scholars - which will help to understand the book's role in their lives and in culture.    No mathematical book had such an impact on early modern culture, yet the Elements in this period has never been the subject of a dedicated study. The proposed project will involve two years of work on archival and printed sources in Oxford and London.","The project addresses three themes that are of perennial public interest: early modern British life, history of science, and how to teach and learn mathematics. The project will prove important new information about neglected aspects of early modern British culture such as mathematical practice and the growth of scientific knowledge. It will fill a gap in our knowledge about the history of science by looking at how mathematics was part of culture in the past and why it mattered so much. And it will provide rigorous background for discussions about mathematics education and the use of Euclidean geometry in the classroom.    The public will be able to engage directly with the project through our project blog and Twitter feed, and we will use the website of the British Society for History of Mathematics to reach an audience including teachers and interested lay people with news about the project. We will also actively seek opportunities to raise the profile of the project with contributions to other blogs, websites and magazines.    The two planned workshops will attract participants from a range of backgrounds including members of the BSHM, museum curators and popularizers, providing a route for the results of our work to be disseminated more widely still to the general public.    Finally the public will be able to visit the display we will organise in Blackwell Hall at the Bodleian Library: a popular city-centre space that attracts a lot of footfall. Here the story of Euclid's Elements will be told using images and objects based on the results of our work.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN009053%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Right-wing agendas have consistently identified feminism, gender equality and anti-racism as a problem, and have used 'anti-gender', 'anti-feminist', and anti-migrant feeling as a way of garnering support for nationalist, cultural, religious or political agendas. Currently 'anti-gender' attacks are on the rise globally, in the form of violence against feminists, LGBTQI communities and institutionalisation of feminist thought in universities, NGOs and governments. 'Anti-gender' aggression also forms part of religious, ethnic, cultural and nationalist fundamentalism in a range of contexts, with gender equality demonised as a foreign import associated with heightened migration and liberalisation, or heightened Westernisation. Within feminism, too, 'anti-gender' work insists on the integrity of 'sex', both as the unique site of sexual oppression of women, and as a unique position from which to challenge sexual violence and its representations. In this context, trans* claims to integrity are dismissed, and critiques of sexual essentialism from within decolonial feminism remain unacknowledged. The research network starts from a critique of sexed, sexual, racial and cultural 'authenticity' that lies at the core of 'anti-gender' rhetoric, exploring Arts and Humanities approaches that can help us draw out how these mobilisations work, with the aim of generating more robust tools for resistance to the take up of anti-feminism for right-wing agendas. It will bring together people who are already doing research on 'gender ideology' within academia, or as activists and policy-makers, and ask them to foreground a focus on concepts and narrative in order to contribute to the network's transnational methodological aims. We will invite participants from the main sites of 'anti-gender' mobilisations: Brazil, India, Pakistan, Hungary, Germany, Poland, the UK, the US and Scandinavia to participate in four linked events as follows: 1. Politics. This workshop will identify the 'politics of ""anti-gender"" mobilisations' across multiple sites and scales by focusing on common languages used, figures invoked, concepts developed and narrative arcs embellished. It will explore methods through which 'anti-gender' approaches are linked to right-wing developments and begin to answer the question of why gender itself is so important as part of arguments about culture and authority. Finally, it will ask after the modes of resistance that also characterise its contemporary politics. 2. Geographies. This second workshop will foreground the question of location and scale in examining crossovers between sites of investigation transnationally. How are a range of different geographies represented as 'under siege', and how are the boundaries and borders of region, nation or culture produced and policed (at the grammatical and rhetorical level). How are such instantiations resisted by transnational social movement for gender equality? 3. Temporalities. The third workshop focuses on the stories told about past, present and future by 'anti-gender' movements transnationally. How are audiences persuaded of what has been lost and what needs to be found (again)? Origin stories about family and nation are key here, but how do these stories work to generate an idea of a shared temporality across different sites? How too do responses from within intersectional feminisms work to interrupt those temporalities to open up new futures? 4. Transnational Imaginaries. This final event will be a larger one that presents the work of the workshops to a broad audience and showcases the importance of a narrative approach as part of developing a transnational methodology to interrogate and resist 'anti-gender' mobilisations. The work starts from a resistance to 'anti-gender' work, and its participants locate themselves as part of trans* inclusive, intersectional, anticolonial feminism attentive to the importance of Arts and Humanities-based interventions to political critique.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW01047X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Methods and 'best practice' for the documentation (recording) of classical music are well established, as is the understanding that access to that documentation is a vital part of education and research. For music involving non-sonic elements, there is neither an established 'best practice' for documentation nor any reliable archive. This interdisciplinary network will explore the problems raised by, and solutions for, documenting and disseminating exemplars of this type of music. Music where the focus is on ""the visual and theatrical energy that lies implicitly in the performance itself, in the creation and bringing forth of single sounds and music on instruments, and in the communication and relationship between musicians and the audience"" (Håkon Thelin, 2011, section 3, http://haakonthelin.com/multiphonics/zab) has roots in experimental and avant-garde practices across the visual and performing arts in the Twentieth Century. It has been historically described with terms such as ""Musiktheater"", ""Instrumental Theatre"", ""Fluxus"", ""Performance Art"" or ""Intermedia"". Recent attempts at codification of this practice include New Conceptualism and New Discipline, but these are partial, theoretical, and do little to advance the practical considerations when engaging with this work in performance. This type of work has been particularly marginalised within music institutions, often finding sanctuary in the visual arts (Robert Filliou quoted in Relational Aesthetics by Nicolas Bourriaud, 2002, p. 102). Despite its 70-year history it has struggled to gain a footing in serious musical discourse. This is in no small part due to the lack of suitably documented works. For music containing only sonic elements there is a clear and well established pathway for its documentation. However, this is not the case for works that contain non-sonic elements. This is not only because video is essential alongside audio, but also because the pieces have so many variables which make successful audio and video recording an order of magnitude more complex than making an audio recording alone. The lack of high-quality, easily available documentation has had a number of significant detrimental effects on the development and performance of compositions with non-sonic elements: - Musicians are uncomfortable performing such pieces, and so they are rarely programmed. - Composers and performers lack an understanding of their historical contexts. - Educators lack the resources to demonstrate best practice in composition and performance. - Researchers struggle to find material on which to base further academic study.  As a result the compositional and performance practices have not matured at the same rate as other forms of experimental music.  For the first time there are enough academic and professional practitioners specialising in music with non-sonic elements for it to be feasible to explore ways to rectify this situation. To do this, an interdisciplinary network is required. Music with non-sonic elements is 'boundary work' that is intrinsically slippery. While practitioners in different (but related) fields implicitly know how to recognise and produce this type of work, recent attempts to explicitly define its parameters have been incomplete. This is because those attempts have come from music alone. What is required is a network of people from music, dance, theatre, visual art and documentation.  Once assembled the network will create rigorous parameters for examining, codifying and finally documenting historic and current works of music involving non-sonic elements; something never previously attempted.","This project has been conceived to respond to the needs of scholars in 20th and 21st Century experimental music, in addition to lecturers in contemporary musical performance practice and musicians outside academia who are involved as performers, composers, ensemble directors and workshop leaders. The project team's existing work producing brief documentary footage of mid-20th Century musical performances involving non-sonic elements has proved to be a valuable tool in communicating the complexities of this type of performance to researchers and practitioners involved in more traditional music-making and scholars in related fields of dance, theatre and visual art. It has also proved useful in teaching music students about good performance practice and staging theatrical compositions. The next logical step is to create a network of expert practitioners that will not only undertake a specialist research project but more specifically develop a concrete method for documenting performances involving non-sonic elements that is widely accessible. This will serve to widen access to this important yet often overlooked tendency within contemporary music. We are incorporating consultation with key musicians and ensembles such as Multi-Story Orchestra (London), Kirkos (Dublin), Mocrep (Chicago), as well as groups within university contexts such as the Music Composition as Interdisciplinary Practice research network, to obtain further feedback from professional user groups. The video output from this project will be linked to high-profile archives such as the Live Art Development Agency video archive in London, which will enable the outputs to be widely disseminated beyond the field of music. Professional composers and performers of contemporary music will often have been through higher education programmes in which the teaching of music that involves non-sonic elements is patchy. Exposure to high-quality documented performances of this practice is rare, and the gap is currently filled by amateur footage uploaded to websites such as Youtube with little contextual information. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this puts off potentially interested performers. As a result, elementary training by musicians and ensembles beyond academia tends to be picked up unsystematically, with little opportunity to explore the nuances of performing music that involves a significant degree of sensitive interdisciplinary thinking. This leaves musicians poorly equipped to perform new pieces inspired by this tradition, which in turn results in poor-quality performances. Our project will redress this by providing solutions in the form of an agreed method of documentation that can be independently explored by practitioners at all career stages and used as a teaching aid. The method will be shared in the form of a professionally produced video documenting a high-quality performance of music with non-sonic elements with in depth analysis and commentary. Music with non-sonic elements is highly social and discursive, involving a degree of lateral thinking beyond the scope of more traditional musical practices. The outputs from this project will thus be useful in educational settings, particularly those where participants have limited musical experience. A lack of conventional musical training is not necessarily a hindrance to engaging with this type of music, and this type of work can integrate transferable skills from people trained in theatre and dance, which can provide an access point to contemporary classical music. In this way the outcomes of this project can be used by policy-makers to increase participation in the arts. By creating this network the team will be able to establish best practice methods in documenting, preserving and reworking compositions that are non-conventional. The network will inform future performance practices and the curatorial decisions of promoters seeking to programme works of this nature in concert halls worldwide.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT001054%2F1

To extend our deployment of inter- and multidisciplinary approaches 2. To encourage and enable blue-sky invention and innovation in the application of the Arts & Humanities across the three Priority Areas for Action. 3. To see the Knowledge Exchange and Impact imperative shape the culture and the structures of our academic and professional service communities 4. The extension and enhancement of career and skills training and development provision for our new and next generation Arts & Humanities practitioners. It will do so through the achievement of three objectives within the term of the award: 1. The conception and completion of a portfolio of pilot and proof-of-concept inclusive innovation projects (Priority Areas 1 and 3) with regional partnerships which will provide a template for larger scale and longer term proposals in wider networks. All funded activity will be aligned to the priorities identified by public authorities, NGO/Third Sector agencies and/or community groups. Design and delivery will be a co-production with Creative Industry SMEs. 2. The design and delivery of short and medium-term interventions that will inform policy and practice in the improvement of sustainable living, working and tourist environments of the South-West region (Priority Area 2). We will deepen the relationships with regional, national and international stakeholders (South West LEPs; National Trust; UNESCO Creative Cities) already initiated and in most cases already underpinned by MoUs. 3. Building on the success of skills workshops in digital applications and KE sandpits in the domains of Environmental and Social Policy and Health & Wellbeing which we have trialled since 2018/19 (some in partnership with our regional AHRC and ESRC DTPs), we will produce a suite of inclusive training opportunities prioritising the participation of PGRs, ECRs and staff with diverse role profiles and career paths. We will integrate the collaborations funded under (1) to create a dynamic training conversation in entrepreneurship as the researcher/SME partnerships get underway. In the same way, we will draw on the policy interventions funded under (2) and their public and NGO/Third Sector stakeholders so that workshop participants can reflect critically on Policy KE in real time.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX003264%2F1

'Bringing Landscape to Life: Environmental Histories at Sheringham Park, 1812-2012'  (Daniels P-I, Veale PDRA; Partner Organisation, National Trust)  ii. 'The Invisible College: Creating Communities of Creative Practice'  (Lorimer P-I, Hollis Co-I; Partner Organisation, NVA) [Lead Project]  Introduction: In work undertaken independently to date, the two REC projects have investigated the geography and history of estates created as designed landscapes during the 1800s. At Sheringham, on-going estate histories of environmental change and landscape's scenography have been communicated to diverse publics through an exhibition, and at Kilmahew, a range of site-specific participatory activities have enabled different communities to connect environmental change in the past with projected plans for the near-future of an abandoned estate. This project is designed to capitalise more fully on work already undertaken in two different estate landscapes by identifying areas of common and contrasting research experience at Kilmahew and Sheringham. Its dynamic will be collaborative, critically reflective and comparative, its outputs aimed at ensuring the transferability, applicability and greater impact of locally derived knowledge.  Research Question: The exercise in temporarily twinning Kilmahew and Sheringham will add value to existing activity by providing critical responses to a two-pronged research question: What information about the geographical particularities of these two estate landscapes, and the lessons learned during project operations across 2012, can be shared: i. for the wider benefit of relevant user groups (academic and non-academic) considering comparable activities in designed estate landscapes?  ii. between respective project teams and partner non-HEI organisations for the betterment of future on-site activities centring on questions of environmental change?  Subsidiary Research Questions:  In what ways can the twinned research projects be mutually enriched through the exchange of estate-based knowledge and specialist skills/experience?  In what ways can diverse constituencies of interest (academic and non-academic) benefit from the lessons learned in these projects?  How is it possible to satisfactorily involve diverse accessing publics (ranging from specialist interest groups to local communities) in conversations about the future design of estate landscapes? Scope of Research: Accordingly, amid the two estate landscapes of Kilmahew and Sheringham, and closely informed by the on-site experience of project partners (National Trust and NVA), consideration will be given to intersecting matters of:   environmental change (planned/unplanned; interventionist/entropic; short-term/long-term; species-specific/ecologically generalist)   strategic concern (ownership structures; landscape management models and plans; visitor policies; public communication; approaches to public consultation and community engagement; visions for continuing care),  practical impact (access controls; community traditions and customary uses; public safety; path networks; pressure points; boundaries;).  Planned Activities: 1. Intensive two-day exploratory and knowledge exchange site visits to Sheringham and Kilmahew, where the host project team will be guide the guest project team around the estate landscape, along with a small number of invited project affiliates, and other members of REC project teams (where demonstrably relevant). Activities will be directed at addressing 'key challenges' and understanding 'key locations' on-site, with attentions focusing on how matters of environmental change are being addressed. Additionally, project teams will trade acknowledged expertise in specialist fields (e.g. Stephen Daniels' international expertise on landscape gardening and the tradition of British design; Angus Farquhar's international expertise in designing landscape-scale public art interventions and installations. Daniels and Farquhar will deliver public talks as part of respective site visits.)  2. Preparation of a Toolkit of instructive summary documents - derived from shared experience at Kilmahew and Sheringham - explaining practical techniques for, variously: narrating environmental change; managing environmental change; making environmental change a motor for public communication; making environmental change an opportunity for community involvement. Using a Toolkit template devised successfully in the Landscape and Environment Impact Fellowship , a series of cross-project exchanges will enable production of a set of concise self-help documents, containing transferable and transportable advice. The documents will be designed for future use by non-HEI organisations interested in emulating the kinds of on-site activities piloted at Sheringham and Kilmahew, and, academic researchers (including postgraduate students and early-career researchers) interested in developing comparable kinds of partnership-based, practice-led activities in closely managed and/or abandoned estate landscapes.  Adding Value: The project will add value to existing work by ensuring the exchange and dissemination of crucial information concerning contemporary research practice in historic estate landscapes. It will be of benefit to:  the two collaborating REC project teams   current and future research teams working on impact-orientated projects supported through existing AHRC themes ('Care for the Future') or cross-Council programmes ('Connected Communities', 'Living with Environmental Change')  academic researchers (including postgraduate students and early-career researchers) holding interests in, but lacking experience of, the development of research projects on estate landscapes involving different agencies, organisations and stake-holders  staff in a range of non-HEI partner groups involved in the management of estate landscapes (i.e. charitable trusts, public arts organisations) with an interest in developing new project-based partnerships with the academic research community  Key Milestones: The project extension will begin on 1st March 2013, with an end on 30th March 2014.   Two knowledge exchange site visits by project teams will take place in late spring (at Sheringham) and early summer 2013 (at Kilmahew).   Project dialogue and exchange leading to drafting of Toolkit documents, to take place in summer of 2013, with document finalisation in early autumn.   Preparation/formatting of final Toolkit documents for dissemination via open on-line sites (e.g. landscape.ac.uk, scribd.com and invisiblecollege.org.uk), to take place autumn 2013.   Exchange visits to Glasgow and Nottingham by P-I and PDRA to take place throughout the project.  By the project's close, preparation of a draft journal article will be complete (ready for submission to Landscape Research, explaining and exploring processes of creative, public-facing research practice in different designed estate landscapes.) A Brief Case for Estate Comparability: The Kilmahew and Sheringham estates have much in common. In scale, both are relatively small (Sheringham is around 80 hectares, Kilmahew around 140 hectares). Both raise issues of species management, control and curation, in relation to Rhodedendrons for example. Both sites contain 'ghost' designs, memory traces, elements of absence and voided landscape. In both places vestiges of original parkland design are hidden or exposed, or potentially recoverable. Methodologically, both projects have deployed landscape as a forum for public communication and collaboration. There are also some crucial differences between the sites and projects, which will make comparison instructive. Ironically, Sheringham was designed with an understanding that it would eventually be ruined, and yet has been well preserved; Kilmahew was never intended for ruination, but ruination has become its signature feature.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL503538%2F1

The substantial costs to the health system and the wider economy caused by smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, alcohol misuse and substance abuse are well established. For example, smoking rates among people with a mental illness are three times higher than among the general population. However, while smokers living with severe mental illnesses are just as likely to want to quit as the general population, they are generally more addicted, and face greater barriers to quitting. Similarly, weight gain and obesity are major problems for people with mental health problems, increasing the risk of developing diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, all contributing to low quality of life and exacerbating psychiatric symptoms. Other interwoven and modifiable risk factors associated with the poor physical health of people with mental health problems include low self-esteem, unemployment, loneliness, the low expectations of others, and social exclusion. For a range of social and psychological reasons, including the damage done by stigma, people with mental health problems have relatively limited access to local cultural and natural resources which could improve their physical and mental health.  In recent years, greater attention has been focussed on the physical health of people living with mental illnesses but services remain fragmented and uncoordinated. This disconnect may be particularly true in the relationship between statutory health and social care services, and the community and voluntary sector organisations. Moreover, many lifestyle interventions exist that are of potential benefit to people with SMI these are seldom implemented in community settings and there is a lack of evidence on the development of effective interventions to help people with SMI. The CHOICE project aims to build a community coalition of agencies and people across Northern Ireland to maximise the resources, skills and knowledge held collectively. We will use Community-Based Participatory Research (CPBR), a powerful 'bottom-up' approach which uses innovative and inclusive approaches to empower disadvantaged communities and populations in the co- design and implementation of solutions to address health disparities. CBPR helps bridge research and practice by engaging the community to tackle disparities in population health and has been used in diverse and disadvantaged settings as an efficient means of challenging power imbalances. Importantly, our coalition will assist in identifying and exploiting all the assets and resources that exist in our communities but remain generally underused. Working with the experts by experience, we will use arts-based approaches to highlight the experience of living with mental illness, and the relationship between exclusion and physical health. By the end of the project we will have developed a strong community coalition and an agreed strategic plan to improve the lives of people living with mental illness.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX005852%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Outlawing an entire class of weapons is a major step towards creating a safer world. Forty years ago, on 10 April 1972, the first ever such step was taken as the nations of the world were invited to sign up to the new Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). This treaty, which had been several years in the making, sought to ban biological weapons, or more colloquially germ warfare. As such, it was remarkable for attempting not simply biological arms limitation but full disarmament. Three years later the treaty entered into force, in other words its provisions now had full legal effect. Currently, and despite all kinds of set-backs, 165 nations are states parties to the BWC. Despite its significance, and close to the fortieth anniversary of its entry into force, there is surprisingly little scholarly research on the origins of the BWC, still less on how this treaty was shaped by its broader political and social context. Perhaps more remarkably, most scholarship on the Cold War ignores the BWC. This research aims to draw on a wide range of archival and oral sources to go beyond a blow-by-blow account of the technicalities of arms treaty negotiation, and instead provide a deep historical account of the birth of the treaty. The historical roots of the BWC are intimately bound up with the Cold War and other wider concerns, particularly: Anglo-American relationships; nuclear and chemical weapons policy; varying attitudes to US chemical agent use in Vietnam; the different obligations and interpretations of the 1925 Geneva Protocol; and the complex roles of experts, both scientific and social scientific, individual and collective, civil and military, in shaping events. In this respect:    1. Existing accounts give an adequate overview, but there remain crucial gaps in description and analysis. We have but a scant account of the foundations of discussion about the BWC, the negotiation period, or the period until the BWC's 1975 entry into force. 2. Many potentially important direct and indirect influences on the BWC have not been explored. For example, the negotiators of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty were the same as for the BWC; the full influence on treaty negotiations of uses of tear gas in Vietnam and poison gas in Yemen 1967 remains unexplored.  3. Existing accounts of the BWC are only suggestive about: the influence of non-governmental groups such as Pugwash and the Bernal Peace Library; the thinking of individuals such as Hedley Bull, the international relations scholar, turned director of the Arms Control Disarmament Research Unit of the Foreign Office; and the actions of scientist-advisers such as Sir Solly Zuckermann. By addressing the gaps and research problems outlined above, we suggest that a more thorough historical account based primarily on UK and US sources will contribute far more than added layers of description to existing analysis. In short, our study will seek to write the BWC into the historical writing about the Cold War and, in particular, the period of detente. The research will be of value to academic historians, political scientists and sociologists. This project will make a significant contribution to the mission of the AHRC/RCUK Global Uncertainties Programme by setting approaches to removing conflict (including weapons of mass destruction) in a richer historical context.   Through a series of public events, we intend to demonstrate how this research will be relevant to users outside the academic community, particularly those concerned with the development of effective policy approaches to the threat posed by biological weapons such as civil servants, the security community, policy-makers, NGO workers and campaigners.","The impact plan builds on the team's outstanding track record of impact across a range of audiences. The PI and Co-I have been involved in a range of communication and engagement activities and have built an extensive range of contacts with stakeholders directly interested in biological arms control (see Pathways to Impact). The proposed research is of significant relevance to users outside the academic community, particularly those concerned with the development of effective policy approaches to the threat posed by biological weapons such as civil servants, the security community, policy-makers, NGO workers and campaigners and is planned to be disseminated accordingly.  The Parliamentary Office of Science & Technology (POST) describes various ways in which sound historical research can inform the policy process. It can provide, for example: background and context for policy debates; identify lessons that can be applied to the present and dispel myths and misconceptions ensuring that current policy is based on informed understanding of events (POST 2009). In addition, historical analysis can open up past decision-making processes, which in retrospect often appear inevitable, by identifying factors that led to specific policy choices and exploring what alternatives were available at the time. History can also help identify the differences as well as similarities between historical and contemporary cases helping avoid superficial analogies. As outlined in the project proposal and pathways to impact, we envisage that our historical research will likewise feed into the contemporary BW control policy arena. As such this proposed project will be of significant relevance to non-academic users such as policy makers and policy shapers and other members of civil society concerned with the development of effective policy approaches to counter the threat posed by biological weapons. Initial research outputs will be ready for dissemination to mark the 40th anniversary of the entry into force of the BWC in 2015 and at the annual meetings of States Parties to the BWC in Geneva (2012-2015). These outputs will also feed into and complement work being done in the US to mark the anniversary of President Nixon's decision to renounce its offensive biological weapons programme. Both the PI and Co-I are deeply committed to communicating their research in an accessible manner to non-academic communities such as policy makers and other stakeholders directly interested in biological arms control (see Pathways to Impact). As well as pursuing academically excellent research, published in peer reviewed journals and books, the research team will also produce Briefing Notes targeted at non-academic audiences including those engaged during the research. A project website will also be designed to showcase the research.  The research team also intends to host a witness seminar, an anniversary workshop on 'The BWC at 40', and a stakeholder symposium. The witness seminar will function as both a means of gathering data and for dissemination, so a small stakeholder audience apart from the witnesses will be invited. The 'BWC at 40' workshop will bring academics and stakeholders together to produce an edited publication of proceedings in time for the BWC's fortieth anniversary of entry into force in 2015. The cross-sectoral symposium (in 2015, again to mark the BWC entry into force) will be convened to promote awareness of the research and communicate emerging outputs. Input will be sought about how the research and its outputs might be tailored to be of maximum use to stakeholders. In organizing these events we will also exploit our links to the academic community and particularly younger scholars. This is an increasingly important activity because the community of academics engaged in this area is suffering from demographic problems with many of the leaders nearing retirement.

"Funding details                                                                                                              Screen encounters across borders are transforming. Transnational video-on-demand services like Netflix and YouTube fundamentally change viewing patterns and affect the nature and extent of overseas audiences' digital encounters with the UK. But we do not know how. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap by applying overlapping and integrated analyses of: (1) How young Europeans define, find, access, value and experience screen content (fiction & non-fiction) from the UK, and what motivates them to do so; and (2) how they understand the UK and British culture based on their screen consumption and wider UK-related experiences, and how this impacts their attitudes about the UK. The project's intervention is timely and important, culturally and economically: Popular culture plays a decisive role in circulating representations, which viewers use to make sense of the world. As radically different mediascapes (Appadurai 1996) emerge, it is vital that we comprehend how they reshape viewing communities, and impact UK content distribution and by extension the production and 'modes of cultural reproduction' (Vertovec 1999) that inform and shape how people perceive the UK. The country's departure from the EU lends additional urgency and makes Europe a particularly important site of investigation now. The research focuses on young, digital audiences (aged 16-34) in four case study markets, Denmark, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands-chosen for feasibility, variety in market size, different levels of English-proficiency and perceived cultural proximity to the UK. Six questions guide the research across three work packages: markets, cultural intermediaries and young audiences. The mixed-methods approach combines document analysis to assess market trends with quantitative and qualitative methods (survey, digital activities, online interviews, workshops) to illuminate viewing behaviours, preferences for and views about UK screen content, and the role that cultural intermediaries from industry, education and social media play in in shaping these behaviours. Academically, the research is of relevance to the fields of media, film, TV and cultural studies, audience research, intercultural communication and cultural policy. Alongside its significant and important empirical contribution, the project makes a theoretical intervention by advancing our understanding of (1) the complex interaction of personal, demographic, local, national and transnational forces that determine the consumption and reception of screen content; and (2) how digital encounters with other cultures impact opinions and behaviour towards these cultures, with implications for international relations. Methodologically the project makes a vital contribution by adopting and promoting a transnational research framework, and by developing an innovative mixed methods approach for researching digital, transnational screen audiences in context.  Outside academia, screen practitioners will benefit from a better understanding of how young European audiences find British content and what they like and value about it. UK political institutions and cultural policy makers will benefit from insights about how young Europeans perceive the UK and the role screen content plays in shaping perceptions. Non-academic project partners include the BBC, BBC Studios, the British Council, the BFI, All3Media, HMR International, and the Producers' Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact). Research findings will be shared widely with industry, policy and academic communities in the form of 4 open access interim country reports, 2 webinars, an edited book with papers from practitioners and academics attending 5 knowledge exchange roundtables, and an end of project symposium and report. Academic dissemination further includes conference papers, 3 journal articles, two ECR/PGR methods workshops and a co-authored book (post-award).",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW000113%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will be a collaboration with community partners to co-design and evaluate new approaches to consultation. Consultation, the engagement of communities in public service decision making becoming an increasingly important part of local and regional life, with moves to help communities be more active and connected to their wider environment. This encouragement of ground up activity reflects a groundswell of new community, friends and special interests groups forming across the UK. It is also recognised by national government with legislation such as the Localism Bill (2011) laying out a sweeping agenda for empowering communities, e.g. giving residents the power to instigate local referendums on any local issue. Public bodies have always been involved in consultation with their communities and there is a strong desire for this to increase in the future and to support communities in playing a larger, more active role in society. This need (and desire) for more consultation coincides in dramatic reductions of Council funding. In the last 3 months one of the public sector partner departments we work with has been reduced from 22 to 4 people. Clearly new consultation practices are needed to accommodate both the opportunity presented by the demand for more consultation and a quite different funding landscape. Leapfrog will help create and evaluate these new models, working initially with test beds in Lancashire and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and then more broadly across the UK. Lancashire has closely packed overlapping communities that are hard to engage, e.g. with low rates of English literacy. The Highlands and Islands communities are very geographically dispersed and isolated and are strongly motivated to innovate by the hardships they face in terms of communications and access. Working across these two test-beds will stress test our new consultation approaches and help make them more robust when applied in other parts of the UK. We will develop these new approaches through a process of co-design. This involves collaboration with communities and public sector partners where all parties play an active role in the creative process (Cruickshank et al 2013). Communities will engage in a co-design process that results in a range of new consultation tools that specifically meet their local needs. For us a tool is something that, with skill, can be used to make wonderful, diverse, creative things (just like a real physical tool). In this proposal we are developing tools to help all people create their own amazing consultation processes. Our consultation tools will be used by communities directly, they will also be exchanged with other communities who will be encouraged to appropriate and adapt these tools to fit their own needs. Tools could be physical, digitally downloaded and printed or entirely digital in nature. We will use these tools to develop toolboxes containing a themed set of tools (e.g. consultation without writing, for groups with low levels of English literacy). We will produce at least 50 of each of the 5 toolboxes we produce. We will seed these toolboxes in at least 80 communities and public sector bodies across the UK. Underpinning all our actions, from co-design to innovation in local consultation to widely distributed toolboxes will be a series of new evaluation frameworks. These will be used to understand the real value and impact of the new tools. With strong guidance from Gareth Williams, our applied ethicist, these evaluation frameworks will be designed to be unobtrusive but also to examine activities in terms that make sense and are seen as valuable to communities. Rather than evaluation being something that is 'done to' communities this will also be a collaborative, mutually beneficial shared process. Cruickshank, Coupe and Hennessy, 'Co-Design: Fundamental Issues And Guidelines For Designers: Beyond the Castle Case Study', Swedish Design Research Journal no 2, 2013. page 4","In the Pathways to Impact document we identify 5 key types of impact and how the actions within the project will achieve these impacts. Here we expand on the definition and explanation of these impacts. i1) To transform our public sector partners` ability to co-design, consult and engage with communities. This will be manifest in new tools, approaches and practices but will be driven by a change in culture of how these institutions think about engagement: Public services need to do more and more effective consultation with diminishing resources. We will help our partners to transform their consultation and engagement practices. We will do this through the collaborative creation of new tools with a focus on hard to reach groups such as teenagers and the socially disengaged. The use of these tools will be complimented by helping partners develop the skills to use the tools in their own, creative ways. These skills and successful new consultation activities will start to build a culture of innovation and peer-to-peer exchange within the council and other public sector partners. i2) To have a material economic benefit for public sector participants by making consultation more effective and reducing the need to employ external consultants: Public services often use external consultants to undertake activity with communities. Inevitably these consultants are costly and somewhat dislocated from the communities they are working with. The aim of the tools and toolboxes designed as part of Leapfrog is to give public sector workers a greater capacity to do more and better consultation themselves and that communities can be much more self sufficient in undertaking their own consultation (see i3). An important result of these new tools is that our public sector partners will have to employ external consultants less often, offering a significant cost saving. On reviewing our plans for Leapfrog, our public sector partners predict that this will result in a saving of over £500,000 over the duration of the project. i3) To transform the ability of local community partners to organise, form effective groups, to productively 'self consult' and engage more actively and productively with the issues most relevant to them': Our tools will help local communities have a more effective voice. This will help community groups at all stages of maturity. For emerging groups it could be to help a loose collection of people to form into a coherent group with the tools and experience to back up their aspirations with evidence of the strength of feeling in the community (self consultation). For more developed community groups our tools could provide the key to unlocking lottery and heritage funding. Successful applications to these funding sources depends on evidence of a real groundswell of community feeling. Our tools will give community groups the ability to understand and evidence their communities` feelings more effectively and reliably. i4) Provide a strong impetus for the improvement of consultation, engagement practices and approaches nationally (and internationally): We will enable this through the creation of numerous tools (digital, physical and hybrid) and 5 distinct toolboxes. These will be promoted and freely distributed across the UK to community groups, local authorities and other public services, with active seeding of tools in over 80 groups and an open platform for the free distribution of tools. i5) To help any group or institution that undertakes consultation activities to understand, evaluate and improve their engagement activities: Good evaluation of engagement and consultation in the private sector is both critically important and rare. The innovative, unobtrusive, creative evaluation frameworks we develop and share will enable any public consultation process to be evaluated more effectively.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM001296%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Knowledge of climate change has tended to remain in the scientific realm. Yet it is not only advances in science but local observations and experiences in nature and oral histories that can prove useful in helping to conceptualise and understand how weather and its variations affect and have affected people at the local level. Local, lay or 'experiential' weather is assuming new importance as a legitimate source of knowledge, and communication of climate change risk is thought to be more effective and appropriately targeted if it takes into account these relevant personal and vicarious experiences in the form of narrative, memories and anecdotes. One way to achieve a (re)engagement of people with climate is by inviting them to reflect on their local weather (past and present). Our proposed follow-on activity will be organised around the theme of weather memory and will capitalise on opportunities that have emerged from the original Care for the Future funded project. We will use the research material now gathered in the TEMPEST database (c. 18,000 event records) i) to develop the design of user interface on TEMPEST and produce a short tutorial/demonstration video, ii) to write a series of place-specific historical weather stories and collate these in the form of a research guide, iii) to support the development of a 'tour ready' version of 'The Storm Officer'. Each output is public-facing and will be widely circulated in print/ on line using existing project communication channels, those of the Archives and Records Association, and at the public events that lie at the heart of this follow-on activity. The overall aim is to demonstrate TEMPEST's utility among a range of users and to engage people with local weather memory and heritage. Through a formal partnership with the Archives and Records Association and return visits to a number of the Local Government Record Offices (LGROs) and National Collections from which we have drawn both materials and research advice, we hope to inform staff and archive users of our findings and to highlight the utility of their collections for weather history, identifying possible actions for future cataloguing and collecting practice and volunteer-led projects. The place-specific story guide will be available for the LGROs to use and will be designed to enable and encourage each archival repository to identify new connections with other collections and archival repositories within and across regions.  The research team will also work alongside poet and writer Matt Black and his creative team to develop a 'tour ready' version of 'The Storm Officer'. Matt's first play was inspired by the contents of the TEMPEST database and previewed in March 2017. Five new performances (all free to attend) will be staged during the period of the follow-on. The locations for the performances have been chosen to match those where rich documentary weather heritages have already been explored by the project team. Each will involve direct engagement with weather histories specific to the place of performance, drawing on the research material already collected by the researchers and now held in the TEMPEST database. Live performances will be enriched through researcher led pre-show workshops that will focus on the archival materials available for weather history in that particular place (using the place-specific weather stories and video as starting points), as well as recent experiences of extreme weather. Connections will also be made between the performance and the relevant LGRO and their resources, with staff and volunteers from the LGRO invited to participate in the workshop and attend the performance. Each element of the Follow-on activity involves creative engagement with non-academic audiences and user communities to stimulate new pathways to impact for the original research, and will expand the utility of research output for a range of new audiences, adding significant value to previous activity.","TEMPEST has wide utility for academics from a range of disciplines and practitioners (e.g. Environment Agency, Natural Resources Wales) but we anticipate that members of the general public with interests in weather will be the primary users. By engaging and exchanging knowledge with the NMLA, NLW, and LGROs we hope to publicise TEMPEST to a range of potential users (local and family history groups, volunteers and actual and online visitors). Through performances of 'The Storm Officer' we will broaden awareness of UK extreme weather history, reinvigorating collective and inter-generational memory and equipping the audience with the information needed to place current weather in appropriate temporal and geographical contexts. We anticipate this will also inspire further research, investigation and learning.  The proposed follow-on activities are being conducted in partnership with the Archives and Records Association (ARA), the professional body for archives and records managers. This partnership will allow us to reach the entirety of the Country Research Archive Network (CARN). The ARA will also support our planned workshops at selected LGROs (Derbyshire, Norfolk and Hereford) and the National Meteorological Library and Archive and the National Library of Wales. We will disseminate resources and information (the TEMPEST video and place-specific weather stories research guide) using the different communication channels of the ARA in order to engage with a broad audience. We will introduce the research to their membership through a short 'Opening Lines' piece within their monthly magazine which is distributed to all member organisations (May 2017). This details TEMPEST as a 'special repository' and outlines it's relevance to keepers of archives and records in the UK. A link to our publication in the Archives and Records journal provides further detail on our research to date. The ARA run regional training events for their members. We will attend one of these to raise awareness of our research and the potential of the holdings of LGROs for weather and environmental history more broadly, alongside discussion of cataloguing, collecting and project practice. ARA also jointly deliver the annual 'Explore Your Archive' campaign (www.exploreyourarchive.org) with the National Archives, which aims 'to increase public awareness of the essential role of archives in our society, to celebrate our network of collections and emphasise the skills and professionalism of the sector'. Weather is a connecting theme and one we will look to promote during the campaign through our work with individual local government records offices. The ARA acts as the secretariat for the All Party Parliamentary Group on Archives and History, an advocacy group for the archives sector, history and related issues, including history in education. This also promotes a history lecture series in Parliament to which the applicants hope to contribute. Archival repositories local to each of the new performance venues (Derbyshire, Norfolk, and Hereford Local Government Record Offices, the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, and the National Meteorological Library and Archive in Exeter) support the initiative, while through Matt Black we will work in conjunction with Live and Local and the Community Touring Scheme and Arts out West who will provide access to a range of venue possibilties to stage the play in locations close to those selected for the public workshops. Both these rural touring companies supported the previews of The Storm Officer in March 2017 and the follow-on activity develops these connections further. Other performance locations/networks have pledged support (Aberystwyth Arts). 'The Storm Officer' and supporting research workshops will be promoted by each venue and we will work to ensure the performances feature in local listings in paper and online. We will also work with our University Press Offices and the AHRC Press Office to publicise the events.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR004595%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project is designed to stimulate innovation in immersive theatre performance and in software applications that can form an integral part of a performance. It brings together academics from the Universities of Reading and Bath, the theatre company Dante or Die and the creative technology company Marmelo. It explores how to engage with spectators both collectively and individually to exploit the capabilities of live interactive technology in the context of a public performance event. The project will include the creation of a performance, titled 'User Not Found', for which Marmelo will produce an app for interactive mobile devices that can be exploited in theatre performances and other kinds of public events. The app will be developed to simulate, via remote triggers, the normal operation of a mobile or tablet device but has the potential to be developed for various contexts, including improving access for deaf and disabled audiences, through captioning via smartphone technology, enhancing audience participation and interactivity and contributing to immersive experiences in a range of cultural events  Currently, the lives and memories of most people in developed countries are expressed and accompanied by their history of electronic communications, their social media interactions and their collections of data such as photographs, videos and music. Social media traces are integral to identity, rather than being secondary to it as reflections, distortions or extensions. The relationship between people and their social media lives becomes particular clear and problematic after death and in the process of ageing, people may prepare for death by crafting their digital legacy thus reflecting on their identity and seeking to pass on a version of themselves. In Dante or Die's performance, 'User Not Found', the central character experiences bereavement and mourning via the digital traces of his dead partner and the performance will focus on the relationship between life, death, identity and social media, using the immersive technology developed by Marmelo to explore the topic of internet and website legacies, following the death of a user.   Since the topic of the performance is social media technology and death, the project will draw on the expertise of CI Dr. John Troyer, to explore ways in which industries surrounding death, for example, grief counsellors, funeral directors and lawyers, are addressing the issue of an internet legacy. Research in this area has been carried out in the fields of Human Computer Interaction, Information Science, Ageing and Death Studies, for example, and it has been explored in popular media representations such as the television series Black Mirror.  This research grant application is to develop a project that builds on initial groundwork, including with intended collaborators and experts and winning R&D funding for performance development. It will use immersive theatre performance alongside an online software application, to explore and debate issues of virtual life, death, memory and identity for a range of audience constituencies. To disseminate the work, the project will draw on the existing networks of venues that regularly support and host DOD performances to stage 'User Not Found' in non-traditional performance spaces, and thus encourage new audience constituencies. The project will create opportunities for 'User Not Found' to form part of participatory workshops with relevant stake-holders: e.g. social media companies, funeral directors, bereavement counsellors. .","The project will assemble a unique creative collaboration between a theatre company, a creative technology agency and academic experts in theatre and death studies. We aim to create opportunities for impact by developing links between the participants so that they will change each other in ways that are beneficial to them. This project will develop social media technologies that can be exploited in immersive theatre performances and other kinds of immersive public events. It will have impact on professional theatre makers and the venues where performances and events using new social media applications are staged, including on accessibility of performances and engagement with new audiences. Impact on Dante Or Die Theatre Company will be new opportunities to develop their track-record of site-specific performance and their interest in identity and memory, in a way that would not be possible with their existing resources and contacts. A key impact will be to provide technology that they can use to create the performance User Not Found and further related work. Although DOD, have been working professionally since 2006 the main impact of this project is that it will be a pilot that helps them to develop new kinds of immersive, technologically enhanced performances. Troyer's expertise in Death Studies will impact on DOD, offering a more sophisticated approach to the issues of social media legacy, memory and identity. Building the software to make this immersive performance happen will be carried out by the technology company Marmelo, and the impact on them will be primarily on their ways of working, their opportunities for engagement with the creative industries and with experts and users beyond their existing range of clients and their fellow IT professionals. Impact on Marmelo will be to offer an opportunity for new product design and testing of a new app that can be used in creative industry events, training days and team building exercises. The added value for Marmelo comes from dialogue in a structured way with the other members of the project team. Marmelo is a small commercial creative technology agency, operating since 2015. This project will impact on them by extending their connections with the creative industries to generate cutting-edge uses of their technology products. The project could also lead to the establishment of a Knowledge Transfer Partnership between University of Reading, and a selected graduate, with Marmelo. The project will provide opportunities for Marmelo to explore how their app might be used as part of accessibility strategies at events where there are deaf or hearing impaired people. The creation of the app and its presentation as part of User Not Found will offer venues and arts organisations new ways of engaging younger audiences accustomed to social media on everyday mobile devices. The app provides the potential for producing organisations to host immersive events in spaces (interior or exterior) with little technological infrastructure; availability of a wi-fi signal will be all that is required. We will create opportunities for User Not Found to form part of participatory workshops with interest groups who deal with social media legacy after death, including stakeholders in digital legacy, and professional and commercial workers in this field such as counsellors, funeral directors, lawyers and hospice workers. The location of the project team in the Thames Valley facilitates impact on technology companies based there who can be alerted to their responsibilities with regard to social media legacies.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR010293%2F1

"Funding details                                                                                                              How do we create a healthcare system that respects and protects ethnic, cultural, and religious differences in an intensely pluralist society? How do we create a healthcare system that guarantees decision-making power in matters of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) for women from Indigenous communities in a society in which both sexual and reproductive rights (SRR) and Indigenous rights are subject to increasing political pressure? What is the role of traditional healing practices in the construction of reproductive justice? The project addresses these questions in response to and in collaboration with researchers and activists from the Pankararu and Xukuru communities in the Northeast of Brazil. While Indigenous people have their own healthcare system and there are separate national policies concerning respectively Indigenous- and women's health care, Indigenous women remain almost invisible to Brazilian indigenismo and face persistent and structural inequalities in the area of SRH. Studies have shown that maternal mortality rates among Indigenous women in Northern Brazil are 2-4 times higher than among non-Indigenous populations. Importantly, Xukuru and Pankararu women frequently give birth outside Indigenous territories and experience rates of caesarean sections far above those recommended by the WHO. This suggests serious problems with access to healthcare services, which additionally fail to prevent STD/HIV/AIDS and cervical cancer, but data remains scarce. These problems have been exacerbated in recent years by the increased violence against Indigenous people perpetuated by Temer's and Bolsonaro's governments and the outbreak of Covid19. The existential threat to Indigenous communities was recognised by the Federal Supreme Court, which in 2020 affirmed for the first time the right to health of Indigenous people and 'the indispensability of intercultural dialogue' in any question involving their rights. Against this background, the project aims to consolidate reproductive justice by enhancing access to SRH care of Indigenous women in accordance with their cultural practices. It does so by empirically examining Indigenous conceptions of SRH and the ways in which they are accommodated in Brazilian law, policy, and medical practice. It examines violations of SRR and their effects by analysing national and regional laws and policies and conducting interviews with Indigenous leaders, activists and policy makers. The project pays particular attention to the role of healthcare professionals and traditional healers in the construction of reproductive justice and how their relationships shape the provision of culturally sensitive SRH services. It does so by organising interviews and participant observation involving doctors and shamans. All findings will be shared with members of the Indigenous communities, policy makers and healthcare professionals through 2 feed-forward Workshops, 2 training sessions, the production of a Final Report, and educational materials produced in collaboration with a local artist. The project will also produce 3 high quality academic publications, a special edition of a journal, and several conference papers.  The project is co-produced with members of Indigenous communities and will first and foremost benefit those seeking SRH care. While the Xukuru and Pankararu communities have approximately 20000 members, in Brazil there are nearly 900000 Indigenous people from 305 ethnic groups. Second, the project will benefit policy-makers and Indigenous activists involved in the field of healthcare in the Northeast of Brazil and beyond. Third, it will benefit healthcare professionals who provide services within and outside the special Indigenous healthcare system. The impact of the project will be facilitated by the support of the regional Public Prosecutor's Office tasked with the protection of Indigenous rights, and the Representation of Indigenous People and Organisations in Northeast Brazil.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX008118%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Context In the previously funded project ('Lifting the Lid on Bacteria') children devised many interesting ideas to help communicate the importance of hand hygiene to their peers when in school toilet spaces. The final overall concept developed was 'Use 123 to get germ free' and this message, and associated messages/graphics were placed imaginatively in cubicles, on washing devices and around the wall areas. The areas where the designs were installed (in 3 primary schools and in Eureka! Museum) became much more colourful, engaging and helped improve hand hygiene by increasing the use of soap by between 41% and 60%. The designs were very well received by the children who helped create them the people that used the space and other stakeholders. The project won the 'Best Education and Research Award' at the E-Bug Conference, London in January 2019 and we have given invited presentations in Denmark and Nepal. We have also published 3 journal articles and have 3 articles under review as part of the previous project. Aims and Objectives This project aims to enhance the commercial viability of our wall-based graphics. In the previous research, through interviews with teachers and children, 3 areas were identified that would exploit the 123 concept further - 1) the need for a classroom-based introduction to the designs, 2) an element of the design that teachers could easily customise or alter when there are outbreaks of infection and 3) a take-home pack for parents to ensure the message moves from school to the home. We propose to carry out these extensions to the concept to create a more desirable '123' package for schools to use and we will work with a partner school, through co-design workshops with teachers, children and parents, to ensure ideas match their needs. Once finalised, the package will be made available to download at minimal cost through a University fast-licensing system and we will identify a reliable printer/materials to recommend to schools. We also aim to share our designs with a wider audience. In the previous project the graphics were placed in 3 schools and a children's museum and we wish to extend their use both to other schools and to tailor the concept for new audiences. Through attendance at a national head teachers conference and by running an event for local schools, we hope to raise awareness of the 123 concept and disseminate the designs further. In terms of new audiences we propose to work with a pre-school to tailor the designs for children under 5 and to develop a script to aid understanding. We also intend to install the designs in the Thackray Medical Museum and understand, through liaison with the museum staff, how to tailor the concept for their visitors. We also will test out and tailor how the design concept works in a new international context, working in a school in Uganda. Two short films will be created that will help bring the concept to life for potential new users. The final stage of the activities involves targeted promotion of the product and contacting potential new organisations who may wish to use the product. Downloads of the product will be monitored and follow-up feedback sought. Potential Application and Benefits Evidence gathered from the previous project highlights an increase in soap usage and reduction in instances of dirty hands. The designs therefore play an important role in infection reduction, improving cleanliness standards overall and enhancing the appeal of spaces. By widening the audience for the designs and developing add-on components to exploit the concept further, more schools, children and parents will benefit, in health terms, from improved hand hygiene. By introducing the work to 3 new audiences we will be able to instil better awareness of hand hygiene at pre-school age, we will be able to customise the designs for adults and broaden the dissemination of the concept and lastly, impact positively upon hygiene habits in a Global South context.","The main beneficiaries of the activities are schools, children and parents.  Schools will benefit from the work since they will have the potential to download a resolved package of designs at minimal cost. Given the evidence we have gathered - the designs leading to a reduction in dirty hands (by hand swab testing) and an increase in soap usage (through soap count) - it is likely that schools using the product will see a decrease in infection spread and in turn a decrease in absenteeism. Given education pressures, it is important for schools to retain attendance to avoid children falling behind through sickness. The school in Uganda will benefit from direct improvement to their toilet facilities - from the installation of soap dispensers in the toilet areas to colourful designs placed on the walls and in the classroom. Given the life-threatening/serious nature of the diseases in Uganda caused by poor hand hygiene, it is likely that the designs in this context will have a tangible and positive impact on health quality in the area. Children, whether at primary or pre-school, will benefit where the designs are installed. The graphics enhance the appeal and colourfulness of the spaces making them more likely to visit the spaces. Children taking part in the co-design workshops will also benefit from being more involved in the creative generation of ideas, leading to a sense of empowerment and learning more about the design process and problem solving. Parents, both those taking part in workshops and those receiving the packs, will benefit from learning more about hand hygiene which in turn, should reduce the spread of infection in the home. The packs will help them to reflect on their own hand hygiene practices, not just their child's behaviour. The designs include simple and rhyming messages about why all 3 elements - soap, water and drying - are needed and thus wider dissemination of this message will enable people in homes to make a more informed choice about whether to wash hands or not.  The installation of the designs at Eureka! Museum in the previous project provoked much positive feedback from visitors. Of particular note were comments related to the fact that the designs continued their child's learning experience from the galleries into more public service spaces. Recorded comments include ""I think they're brilliant - they should be everywhere"" and ""I recently visited Eureka with my two children aged 3 and 8. We found the most inspirational and thought provoking toilet facilities for young children we have ever seen. My 3 year old recalled her visit to family members last night and mainly talked about the toilets"". We therefore have reason to believe that the designs installed in the newly refurbished Thackray Medical Museum have definite potential to enhance the visitor experience and reflect positively on the museum itself and the feedback they receive.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT008601%2F1

GBV disproportionately affects women and girls who often suffer more serious mental and physical health and social consequences compared to men and boys. In all settings GBV against women and girls is recognised as a high-risk factor for poor health outcomes including mental health, adverse reproductive outcomes, poor sexual health, disability, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury and even death. There is a notable scarcity of research and insight into how women mitigate and develop resilience in the face of these adversities, and how they construct resilience for positive living. This represents an untold story which the network intends to explore. The concept of resilience is gaining traction as a research tool, and this is happening in tandem with a recognition that the complexity of human communities, conflicting intersectionality, and the challenges faced, are growing more acute. Our network intends to meaningfully address these challenges in their full complexity. Our proposal combines an intergenerational approach to exploring perspectives of women and men on addressing and reducing GBV for promoting mental health and resilience with an inclusive participatory model, novel applied theatre methodology and digital media approaches.  Through the application of applied theatre and storytelling as an umbrella concept, we envisage that these arts-based practice will create theatre with community groups with the aim of inviting change and investigating community-led solutions to the lived experiences of injustice, inequity, and violence. We will undertake this through: (1) Exploring how SDMW can be safely and ethically engaged in identifying critical areas for change in reducing GVB in their communities. (2) Eliciting stories from interested SDMW about their lived experiences of GBV and possible solutions. (3) Co-developing a series of workshops to mobilise lived experience experts and cross-sector stakeholders as agents of change for sustainable and culturally relevant research and impact agenda. (4) Building capacity in existing relationships and establishing new partnerships to strengthen and diversify the network's research base and funding applications.  Our network will extend existing partnerships and develop new collaborations between UK and Indian academics and researchers, members of marginalised slum dwelling communities, theatre practitioners and NGOs. We will explore the forms that violence against women may take, ways they can resist it, and where help can be sought. Our theatrical, storytelling and digital media engagement will offer opportunities over and above conventional research methods to elicit new stories and experiences and catalyse fresh thinking about possible solutions in a way which can engage both women and men from marginalised communities in addressing GBV.  Our network will impact on: (1) promoting peace, justice, dignity, wellbeing and resilience for this vulnerable community by facilitating effective and context-relevant solutions to GBV; (2) direct engagement in addressing GBV through co-creation of knowledge on resilience, and GBV prevention of strategies; (3) building capacity, facilitating preventative and resilience building measures to address GBV in slum dwelling internal migrant communities to promote gender equality, social justice and economic development; (4) inform national and international debates on culturally appropriate GBV prevention strategies for promoting peace, justice and resilience of marginalised slum dwelling communities in India/ South Asia.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW009773%2F1

It aims to create new audiences for the approach to science communication taken by Marie Neurath in her books for children, produced in the 1940s and 1950s. The illustrations in these books, in series such as the 'Wonder world of nature' and 'Wonders of the modern world', were innovative in their approach to the design of complex information. The project team includes members of the original 'Isotype revisited' group; colleagues at the Institute of Education at Reading and their students; teachers and children in primary schools in Reading; project partners Design Science, a science communication and education agency; and House of Illustration, a gallery in London. The team will produce innovative and creative worksheets and animated video for primary school science teaching. The resources will include guidelines for teachers about how to produce worksheets using illustrations based on Marie Neurath's explanatory illustrations. Consultation with teachers and teacher educators as part of the design process will ensure that their ideas and needs are taken into account. Pilot schools will be involved in evaluating the effectiveness of the resources to ensure they are relevant and effective. A curated and designed public exhibition will demonstrate the cultural impact of Marie Neurath's work, in particular raising awareness of her distinctive approach to illustration, using comparison, scale and 'before and after' scenarios, combined with functional use of bold colours. To engage new audiences with this work, this public-facing exhibition at House of Illustration, in summer 2019, will show examples of Marie Neurath's illustration from the children's books, as well as sketches, drawings and correspondence that show the iterative nature of the design process. Design Science will contribute ideas for the contemporary interpretation of the material to engage non-specialist audiences in science. House of Illustration will advise on design and curation of the exhibition, and provide a venue in the cultural quarter at Kings Cross, London.","The non-academic beneficiaries of the 'Isotype revisited' Follow-on project include primary school teachers (including trainees) and their classes; people with interests in illustration, education, design and science communication; and design practitioners. Our enthusiastic project partners Design Science and House of Illustration will also benefit from the project. Design Science will enhance its profile through opportunity to showcase its science communication work to teachers and academics. House of Illustration will benefit from being able to host original material from the Isotype Collection at Reading. They will be recognised as the first gallery to host an exhibition focussed on Marie Neurath's approach to illustration in children's information books. Both partners will benefit from being involved in a project funded by AHRC as it reinforces the value that they can add to research and its impact, and their commitment to it. We will capture evidence of impact through qualitative and quantitative measures. Our Impact Evaluation Report will detail feedback about the new teaching resources as a result of their use in primary schools, and comments arising from the exhibition. We will ask our project partners to tell us about any benefits (such as new contacts and projects) that have occurred as a result of their engagement with the Follow-on project. Our project partners are keen to assist in the delivery of the impact of this Follow-on project, and this is reflected in their expertise and in-kind contribution to the project:  Design Science brings expertise in exhibition design, film and graphic design, and is committed to working collaboratively in pursuit of excellence in the contribution that design makes to science communication. Their main contribution to the project is the development of resources for primary school science and to curation and design of the exhibition. House of Illustration will contribute expertise in curation and design of the exhibition. They have agreed to provide a venue for the exhibition and to provide publicity, technician costs, graphic design materials, framing and conservation, and an opening event. Support for the project is also provided through the staff and pupils at the primary schools that offer placements to trainee teachers at the Institute of Education, University of Reading. We aim to deliver impact by - demonstrating the role that design can play in successful science communication - reaching new audiences and delivering cultural impact through an exhibition in London of Marie Neurath's books and preparatory work that was the result of working in collaboration with scientists, teachers and children - benefitting primary school children and teachers through innovative and creative resources for key stage 1 and key stage 2 science, including animated video adaptations of Marie Neurath's work  - reaching new audiences via a web portal on the 'Isotype revisited' web site that will include worksheets and sets of images/explanations from the books that align with national curriculum topics - writing non-academic papers in design and in education journals (eg Eye magazine and Books for keeps) to reach new audiences and to gauge reactions We propose to capture information about these anticipated benefits by - spending time in primary schools to see how teachers and children use the resources, and to gather feedback about their effectiveness. We will work with our pilot primary schools from the Institute of Education at Reading, and provide questionnaires and guidance for capturing feedback from children. - recording numbers to demonstrate project reach: for example, attendance at the exhibition and public lectures; website visits; downloads; enquiries about the project.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR013837%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              When did human ancestors start behaving like us? Recent research has shown that our direct ancestor, Homo heidelbergensis, lived in Africa 600,000-200,000 years ago and was probably capable of behaviour such as language, symbol use and complex tool-making.The African archaeological record offers some clues to support this thesis, eg, ochre use, possibly for symbolic purposes, and the invention of tools made of multiple parts.Indirect fossil record evidence suggests that this large-brained species formed extended social networks using language.But all this evidence is sparse, poorly dated, unevenly distributed across the continent and insufficient to answer the questions of how, where, when or why these developments took place. This project aims both to add a significant bank of data to the evidence base and expand its geographical coverage.It will provide a research model archaeologists can use elsewhere to generate more data with which to investigate the deep roots of behaviours once thought to be the hallmark of Homo sapiens. A multidisciplinary team will undertake excavation and analysis of three key localities (Victoria Falls, Kalambo Falls, Luangwa Valley) spanning 1100 km of south-central Africa which preserve artefacts from the period associated with H. heidelbergensis,the Early to Middle Stone Age transition,ESA/MSA,filling a large regional gap between the better known records of east and southern Africa. The team includes archaeologists, dating specialists and a research group investigating how stone tools were made and used. Materials with high symbolic content such as beads are unlikely to survive from this period thus our primary focus is on technology as a window on the past. Recent research in east and South Africa points to an invention in tool-making that took place before 300,000 years ago,marking a break with long established traditions of the Early Stone Age. A conceptually new approach to problem solving appeared: the combining of separate parts to invent a new whole. The process of adding a stone to a handle and securing it by various means sounds simple but required levels of planning and learning not previously needed. The individual components were themselves made using other tools, other materials and routines of assembly. This recursive principle of 'combinatorial technology' underpins all later technologies including industrial manufacturing.  In the time of H. heidelbergensis we also see selection of purple, red and yellow ochres for purposes unknown but which in later periods have practical and symbolic values. These cognitively and socially complex behaviours, along with the fossil evidence for a large modern-like brain, point to a species that shared much with its descendant H. sapiens.  We lack the depth of archaeological data to answer the basic questions of time, place and processes of change that make this a potentially key interval in human evolution. This project addresses the need for an Africa-wide perspective on the ESA/MSA transition. Our regional focus offers a test case of a new model of research integrating the best of new dating methods with innovations in the study of early technology. A 'primitive technologist' embedded in the fieldwork will make and use replica tools from the time of the transition. Contemporary local knowledge about materials used in tool-making will be incorporated in the replication experiments. These data will be used to interpret patterns of microscopic wear that accumulate on artefact surfaces in their making and use.Traces of long decayed handles can now be identified by their distinctive patterns of damage. Organic residues may also survive on tool surfaces under the right conditions for preservation. We will be looking for these traces along with evidence of ochre use in the project sites. The results will be compared with what we already know about the ESA/MSA transition in Africa and the research model evaluated in a multidisciplinary workshop.","The project offers two types of societal impact linked to education. Stone Age archaeology is now part of the England & Wales primary school curriculum and Zambia's secondary school curriculum. This is an opportunity to increase public understanding of human evolution and research methods used to study the deep past. 1) We will produce formal educational material tailored to national needs, making it widely available and cost effective. 2) Using social media the educational impact will reach a global community.  In England & Wales, Key Stage 2 History curriculum now covers Stone Age to Iron Age, focusing on the British archaeological record but incorporating wider Palaeolithic topics, eg, technology and evolution of Homo sapiens. A freely available information pack for schools will be produced with a PowerPoint overview of the Stone Age illustrating the interdisciplinary nature of Palaeolithic research and exercises exploring ""what the Stone Age did for us"". Accessible via the project website the presentation will be regularly updated. Seventeen Merseyside schools will be offered replica Palaeolithic artefacts for handling. The selection of replicas will echo the PowerPoint content and link to an exhibition at the Victoria Gallery and Museum (Liverpool) on the origins and influence of combinatorial technology.  In Zambia's new curriculum for junior secondary schools, Social Studies topics include archaeological research methods; human evolution; Stone Age hunter-gatherers. Students are introduced to science-based evidence for human origins and asked to reflect on economic, technological and social changes in the Pleistocene. In the PI's experience of Zambian schools groups there is widespread distrust of an evolutionary perspective on human origins stemming from strong religious beliefs and ignorance of how an interdisciplinary narrative of the past is constructed. We will offer teachers an education pack complementing the Social Studies textbook consisting of a timeline and methods poster with an information booklet for teachers explaining how the past is dated, artefacts analysed and Stone Age life reconstructed. Visits to the excavations will be offered to give students and teachers first-hand experience of archaeological research and Stone Age material culture. The project website, the portal for a global audience, will be written with non-specialist viewers in mind, with links to a project blog post and Facebook page. The blog adds a human dimension, showing the daily realities of fieldwork. Post-excavation analyses will be reported as updates from behind the microscope to maintain interest in the project. We will report on the workshop and inform followers when the final volume is published.  Resources, milestones The project website will be online from September 2016; the Key Stage 2 PowerPoint will be online by September 2017. The website will be produced and maintained by Liverpool's School of Histories, Languages & Cultures website coordinator. Replica artefacts will be scanned and 3D printed by York Archaeological Trust. The Merseyside schools will receive a pack of replica artefacts and supporting notes (£1.2k). The schools are already involved in outreach activities with the University of Liverpool. Posters and information packs for 300 Zambian schools will be produced by Gadsden Books, Lusaka (£375). The poster will be produced using PowerPoint poster templates and will be ready, along with teacher information booklet, for the second field season July 2017. The PI will oversee blog entries and maintenance of the Facebook page. Co-I Gowlett will coordinate teacher pack distribution in Liverpool. The PI will be responsible for production and distribution of material in Zambia as well as arranging site visits for local schools.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN008804%2F1

The 3 year secondment will contribute to the re-establishment of culture-led regeneration in the UK and also pave the way to establishing the first R&D department within a UK commercial property company. In addition, it will shift the focus of private sector led city-scale urban regeneration projects towards people, planet and place, thereby contributing to:   - the national agenda on sustainable and inclusive development   - planning reform   - improving perceptions of academia within the property industry   - setting a new bar for collaborative working across professions, academia and industry In the 1980's, the UK Government initiated a series public sector driven urban regeneration programmes aimed at transforming declining post-industrial cities, this led to the establishment of the UK as a world-leader in urban regeneration and the transformation of cities. Within this climate, the secondee, Dan Dubowitz, pioneered a Cultural Masterplanning approach to transforming post-industrial cities, initially as an academic through action-research for the city of Glasgow, and subsequently through his professional practice 'Civic Works', he shaped culture led regeneration in Manchester, Sunderland, Newcastle, Stoke on Trent and London. Cultural Masterplanning is credited with shifting urban regeneration from a property-centred approach towards a more holistic, people, place and sustainability focused transformation. For example, Ancoats in Manchester went from being a post-industrial wasteland devoid of everyday life to becoming the 10th most popular place to live globally in just 10 years. (See Dubowitz, D. 2011 The Peeps, Manchester University Press). The methods and processes he developed between 1997-2012 were delivered under several publicly driven programmes, and 10 years on, the private sector is increasingly expected to assume the role and burden, previously shouldered by the various now-defunct government agencies, of driving the regeneration of our cities, but without a toolkit to assist delivery. It is widely recognised that to assume the market knows best and/or that the statutory planning processes cover all aspects of development satisfactorily, is inadequate. The UK government is currently exploring ways to improve the statutory planning process to address its many shortcomings, including how communities can be better represented. How then can it be demonstrated that, without public subsidy, Culture-led urban regeneration can improve outcomes for all stakeholders? This secondment seeks to explore, through action research, how Cultural Masterplanning principles and methods that were effective in delivering public subsidy driven urban regeneration can be adapted for the private sector. Firstly, through action research on a live regeneration project underway in Manchester city centre and secondly to apply the principles and research findings to other regeneration projects around the UK. The Host organisation U&I are providing access for action-research, both to current regeneration projects and those being planned and they will be match-funding the secondment (cash and in kind). On completion of the secondment, they will fund/publish an open-source tool kit as well as host a roadshow with exhibitions to share the new Cultural Masterplanning approach, both here in the UK and internationally.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX005283%2F1

R Context: The Works of Allan Ramsay is the first full and consistent scholarly edition of the works of Allan Ramsay (1684-1758), the poet, early Romantic song-collector and cultural entrepreneur, creator of the first established theatre in modern Scotland and probably the first subscription library in the UK. There is one existing textual edition, which is the Martin, Oliver, Kinghorn and Law edition (1945-74). This was assembled by a diverse group of editors without a single unifying textual policy over time. Not only does it not always have a consistent approach to textual editing: it also often does not utilize extant MS readings, and further MS readings (and 130 MSS) have of course come to light since its publication. More can be expected to be identified once an edition is under way: the Burns edition has now identified 160 new MSS not known at the time of the publication of the relevant volume of The Index for English Literary Manuscripts. The Index entry on Ramsay notes the current edition's serious limitations and inadequacy as a scholarly text in uncompromising terms: ...deeply flawed as a scholarly edition. It is badly organised; its transcription of MSS...is unacceptably inaccurate; its contents pages, titling, indexes and apparatus are variously inadequate, inconsistent and error-ridden. (IELM II:3, 172) R methods: There is in no sense, then, a satisfactory textual edition of Ramsay extant. The 'Edinburgh Ramsay' (under contract with Edinburgh University Press, together with supporting monograph) is based on new archival research and is a comprehensive scholarly annotated edition based on contemporary textual editing methods (the PI's work in this area has been described as setting 'new standards for primary research in eighteenth-century song-texts'), with the addition of primary research supportive of both scholarly and KE/Impact outcomes under the University of Glasgow strategy (http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/rsio/knowledgeexchange/). The 'Works' will deal fully for the first time with Ramsay's use of music and the issues raised for the development of Scottish song and its historic performance more generally. The 'Works' will make Ramsay's texts readily available for the first time in many years. Associated web learning resources (including Scottish Qualification Authority relevant resources for schools thanks to the link between Education Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence resources and the University of Glasgow) will support the development of a separate paperback edition of the Poems.  The 'Works' will be accompanied by a volume devoted to the contexts and themes of Ramsay's Edinburgh: art, music, politics, urban environment and many others. This will be supported by a web resource on Ramsay's Edinburgh, which will include an online bibliography, song performances (including historically informed ones) , a section on people and clubs of Ramsay's Edinburgh, a prosopographical study of the subscription list for Poems (1721) and a resource on Ramsay's reception. A concert will be arranged to complement the online song recordings. Reflective scholarly material will accompany recordings. We will also work with external partners, including an exhibition with the National Library with an accompanying symposium highlighting their Ramsay treasures. We will work with the National Galleries of Scotland on their collections policy in the new £17M Celebrating Scotland's Art project CAPEX based on our research findings on the art trade in Edinburgh, and with the University of South Carolina on collections development. We will also lead the continuing development of the Allan Ramsay Literary Festival at the Allan Ramsay Hotel, Carlops (http://www.allanramsayhotel).","Beneficiaries from this research and means by which they might benefit: Who might benefit from this research ?  1. The academic and educational community in language, literature and history. How might they benefit ? Through the creation for the first time of a stable and accurate text of Allan Ramsay's work, a paperback original monograph, a companion volume and online resources, with a paperback selected poems to follow. The special journal issues planned include Studies in Scottish Literature, a gold open access pioneer, which had 170000 downloads in 2015 alone. This special number will focus both on the editing of Ramsay and his significance to Romanticism, Enlightenment, song collecting and ballad opera. 2. The academic and educational community in music. How? Through the first study of the genesis and development of the music for Ramsay's song collecting, and through the recording of historically informed performances. 3. Schools. How? through the dissemination of an advanced Edinburgh in the First Age of Enlightenment web resource by our partners in Education Scotland, and specifically through the songs and the 'Ramsay's Edinburgh' resources.  4. National institutions, the community in Penicuik and Edinburgh, tourists and the public How? Through media, web resources, concert and song recordings, and through the Allan Ramsay Festival, the development of tourist trails and associated tourism and community economic benefit, and also via the National Library Treasures exhibition and National Gallery new £17M CAPEX development where PI is an advisor.  5. Public and charitable agencies and the third sector will benefit. How? From exhibitions and their digital links, e.g. http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/research/researchcentresandnetworks/robertburnsstudies/edinburghenlightenment/) . The National Library of Scotland, National Galleries of Scotland and Glasgow Museums are partners in an overall developing research strategy with the University of Glasgow chaired by the PI, presented to the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, in Glasgow on 11 November 2016. It is the PI's intention that the Ramsay Project will share in the benefits of this development through partnership with the National Library of Scotland and National Galleries of Scotland on the KE committee. New research underpinning £17M Scottish Galleries development will be available to 1.4M visitors a year.   6. The media. How? The PI will set up a Comms strategy with the University of Glasgow Comms office. Media coverage will also provide an opportunity for project staff: the PI's RA on the Editing Burns project recently (February 2016) reached the top 5% of academia edu for media citation, while the PI has repeatedly had top 10 University of Glasgow quarterly media coverage stories from previous AHRC projects and has appeared in the media in 50 countries. 7. Practitioner groups and festivals such as TMSA (Traditional Music) and Celtic Connections. How? The project's research on the origins of song tunes and their historically informed performance will widen traditional performers' repertoire. The PIs close engagement with Glasgow Life will support this dissemination. 8. The Scottish economy. How? Through expanded cultural tourism to Ramsay and Edinburgh. The ' Ramsay's Edinburgh' section of the website (will be offered to VisitScotland (the PI knows the Head of Partnership Communications, Jenni Steele), who will also be engaged with the Ramsay trail development, now under way (first tranche launched at Ramsay Festival 2016). The PI's Royal Society of Edinburgh scoping project has already been adjudged as meeting Scottish Government priorities in tourism, international profile raising and economic development, while his previous research is now accessible via the Scottish Government's official welcome website: http://www.scotland.org/whats-on/burns-night/join-our-global-burns-celebration/",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP015093%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This research network is aimed at strengthening the ties between philosophers of religion, other researchers on religion (such as practical theologians) and stakeholders in religious communities. It consists in a four-way collaboration between the Department of Philosophy at the University of Liverpool, the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Chester, the Department of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies at Liverpool Hope University and faith communities in the North-West of England. Its remit is to open up ways in which each group can benefit from the others and it will achieve this through three initial theoretical workshops, a series of impact events and a final international conference. At stake therefore is the influence faith communities can have on religious research and the impact religious research can have on faith communities, as well as the academy's ability to measure this impact. What is distinctive about this network is the central role philosophy of religion will play. Its aim is to model ways philosophy of religion, theology and the social sciences can interact fruitfully with religious practitioners, so as to promote an inclusive conception of research on religion. The purpose of this network is therefore a more intimate interrelation between theory and practice in the study of religions and, what is more, an interrelation that does not marginalise the distinctive contribution of philosophy of religion. The renewal of religious reflection in twenty-first century Britain demands a joined-up response from the academy - and philosophy of religion needs to be part of this. This network draws on preliminary research in the Connected Communities theme: an AHRC Scoping Study, 'Philosophy of Religion and Religious Communities: Defining Beliefs and Symbols' at the University of Liverpool. It also emerges out of events already held in collaboration between the Universities of Liverpool, Chester and Liverpool Hope on the relation between philosophy and religious practice. The network begins with three academic workshops. Their task is to set in place a general framework for facilitating discussions between practitioners and academics by providing models for impact and its measurement when it comes to research on religion in the humanities. There follows a series of impact workshops which put such models into practice and ensure a voice to religious practitioners in reflecting on the role theory could play in their communities. A final, international conference will be an opportunity to present the conclusions arising out of these workshops.","Questions surrounding impact and the measurement of impact are built into the very purpose of this network. It is devoted to understanding the different mechanisms by which theory is able to shape the language, imaginations and practices of religious communities and vice versa. The models of impact generated from a mapping and typologising process will then be tested and refined by working alongside faith communities in the North-West of England. Religious practitioners will therefore be involved at all levels of the project: in organising events, speaking at them and as delegates. Practitioners will have the space and opportunity to reflect on the relation between theory and religious practice through a participatory and critical engagement with these theories (both from social science and the humanities). In other words, they will participate in extended conversations concerning these issues and have the opportunity to formulate their own responses. The main group benefiting from the network will, therefore, comprise the stakeholders of faith communities participating in it. Representative practitioners will form part of the steering committee, as well as speak at and attend the workshops and conferences. The most significant part of the impact narrative resulting from this network will revolve around the impact events themselves. The programme of impact events, 'Theory in Churches, Mosques and Temples', is aimed at foregrounding the role theory and research on religion play in religious practice and day-to-day religious life. The events will therefore use accessible texts in philosophy, theology and religious studies as springboards for group reflection among practitioners on how theory impacts on religious practice. Further engagement with faith groups and other local communities will be ensured by the project dissemination. The blog will disseminate our investigations in accessible form and will be linked to the University of Liverpool's Philosophy in the City website, Facebook page, Twitter account and mailing list. Linking network dissemination to this already established forum will ensure that members of the local population, who are not necessarily attached to faith communities, will also benefit from the network outcomes.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK003283%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Bertolt Brecht (1998-1956) is one of the most influential and ambitious figures in twentieth-century theatre. While he is known to a broad public for his plays, which are often performed in UK theatres, he was also a great theorizer and practitioner of theatre, and it is the dialogue between these two roles that the project aims to disseminate beyond the academy.  Brecht did himself few favours by coining a series of terms that, on paper, can appear slippery, unachievable or obscure. Verfremdung, for example, has been variously translated as 'alienation', 'estrangement' and 'distanciation', but this process of 'making the familiar strange' in performance can be understood better in practice by articulating contradictory behaviours or attitudes. Other terms, such as Fabel, pose problems for both directors and actors who may struggle to understand how an emphasis on an interpreted version of a play's plot will help them better understand their roles. This project, then, is designed to address the apparent gulf between theory and practice, and is derived from primary research I have carried out into Brecht's practices at the theatre company he co-founded, the Berliner Ensemble.  The project takes as its starting point the 'Brechtian method' of staging drama. The method examines dramatic material for the relationships between the opinions, actions and behaviours of individuals, and the complex ways in which their society informs them. Brechtian directors seek to identify these relationships prior to rehearsal and then use these interpretations in their work with actors. Actors are, in turn, encouraged not to prepare their performances the night before rehearsing a scene, but to understand the scene's social premises and respond in the moment to the performances of other cast members. The aim is to generate lively work predicated on the social situation, rather than the perceived psychology of the characters. As a result, the more fixed 'character' gives way to the more fluid 'figure'. New modes of performance also emerge, ones that seek to connect the figure to its social context.  The concept of a 'method' suggests that Brecht was not only drafting new means for staging his own plays, but also those written by other dramatists. This project thus takes a play by an author not associated with the Brechtian tradition in order to demonstrate to theatre-makers and spectators that Brecht's ideas for and modes of making theatre extend beyond his own ways of conceiving drama. The play chosen for this project, Closer by Patrick Marber (1997), is, to all appearances, concerned with the complicated love-lives of its four characters. It is an exploration of the fickle nature of desire as the four couple, de-couple and re-couple over the course of twelve scenes in the pursuit of the intimacy suggested by the play's title. Brecht, however, invites theatre-makers to consider the social context of the scenes and asks why the characters are willing to 'chop and change' so frequently and why the goal of intimacy is so hard to attain. A Brechtian production may thus choose to examine a society in which human relationships have become increasingly commodified and relate its findings to the manners in which the figures engage with each other. Similarly, the erosion of community and the promotion of the individual in the post-Thatcherite 1990s also feeds into the emotional landscape of the play. A Brechtian production thus aims to relativize the autonomy of individual decision-making and frame it against the background of the given society's social codes. The link of personal behaviour to social values proposes that such behaviour can be changed if people change social structures, and this is the political hope that underlies Brechtian theatre.","There are primarily four groups of non-academic beneficiaries from this project: 1. Theatre-makers: this group, to differing degrees, will benefit from all three major outputs. The most intensive benefit will be felt by the actors involved in the rehearsal and performance of Closer, as they will be able to explore the Brechtian method first-hand. They will engage with new ways of approaching dramatic material and conceiving of character, and will be able to observe the development of a production that seeks to understand the personal in the context of the social. However, this process will be documented, and its most salient moments will form the basis of a website. The website will contain examples of practice to illustrate more general principles of Brechtian theatre, so that theatre-makers can compare Brecht's widely published theories with examples of how they can inform the concrete business of practice. Theatre-makers will also be able to contribute questions, responses and opinions to the site's forum section, which I will moderate to assure appropriate content. Finally, theatre-makers, understood in the first instance as directors and actors, will be offered free weekend-long workshops that will introduce them to and engage them with aspects of Brechtian theatre that they can then integrate into their own professional practice. 2. Post-GCSE dramas teachers: this group will, like the theatre-makers, above, be offered free workshops. Here, however, the sessions will focus on establishing the nature of Brecht's method and working through potential approaches to integrating it into the curriculum. Workshops will be available as one-day inset courses and tailored to the needs of the learners' specific contexts. Teachers will, of course, also have access to the website (publicized through online Drama teacher networks, e.g. the National Association for the Teaching of Drama), which is envisaged as an evolving resource, as more visitors contribute over time. The website will give real examples of rehearsal and practice as a way of helping teachers find suitable material upon which they can build classes. 3. Theatre students: this group will benefit primarily from the way Brecht may be taught in response to the project. As an HE drama lecturer, I have found Brecht taught in something of a 'tick box' style pre-university, that is, the various devices associated with Brecht are taken to embody his theatre as a whole. This project is concerned with making his method the starting point for theatre work that can legitimately be called 'Brechtian'. This is a fundamental change in the way Brecht is understood and, consequently, how future generations may respond to his work. Students may thus benefit indirectly from the workshops offered to both teachers, through their redefined understanding and pedagogy, and theatre-makers, through their implementation of new processes of making work under the Brechtian sign. Students also have access to the website. 4. Theatre-goers: this group will have the opportunity of seeing the results of a Brechtian process live in the form of the three public performances of Closer. This is, of course, the way in which theatre is supposed to be experienced, yet the production's audience is necessarily limited by the size of the venue at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. It is intended that the audience will include 'new end-users' due to the potential to attract and to engage a broad audience from Central's existing networks of spectators. However, other theatre-goers will derive wider benefits indirectly from the theatre-makers, teachers and students who engage with the project either through its workshops or its website because they will encounter further productions and pieces influenced by the project's modes of dissemination.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003047%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The current problems created by the diminishing funding of libraries and museums increasingly limit engagement with communities and inhibits collaborative partnerships. The problem is particularly acute in relation to the use and reuse of digital assets- both at an archival and community level- and this project seeks to provide one solution through the provision of the digital resources created as part of the AHRC funded Pararchive project (www.pararchive.com). Those resources have been branded as YARN (http://yarncommunity.com) and are now freely available. YARN provides a collaborative platform on which communities and public sector organisations can work together to help them establish effective digital community workspaces to deliver a range of co-designed impacts that respond to community needs and institutional aspirations. Thus the aim of this application is to work with a range of communities and public library and archive organisations to help them address a series of difficult self-identified issues relating to local history work, genealogy, co-working, publishing, working with disadvantaged and hard to reach audiences, and the use of 'hidden' or degraded digital resources. The project is based on the desire to build on the unintended consequences of our research and broaden community engagement. Follow-on funding would allow us to do this and act on a range of community requests, develop expanding networks and deliver broad social benefit. We are keen to work with new partners to further disseminate our digital platform and expand its application; to that end we have engaged in conversations with a range of providers about how they might use our resources and have sought to understand the nature of their ongoing problems and digital requirements to determine mutually reinforcing outcomes. Consequently, our focus will be on the development of impact through public networks to produce scalable strategies and demonstrate the value of our tools in a range of public facing contexts.  We have been delighted by the responses to the prototype of YARN and the inclusion of the platform within a number of recently funded research projects and several ongoing applications that have developed in parallel with our own research. For example, YARN has been included on the recently successful Junction Arts HLF JA40 application for community history (http://junctionarts.org/2015/10/ja40/), as part of the AHRC funded Cultural Value Project Digital Tools in the Service of Difficult Heritage: How Recent Research Can Benefit Museums and their Audiences (http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/news/article/4365/new_ahrc-funded_project_digital_tools_in_the_service_of_difficult_heritage_how_recent_research_can_benefit_museums_and_their_audiences ) and the British Academy-funded Leeds Voices- Communicating Superdiversity project(http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/20045/leeds_humanities_research_institute/2718/leeds_voices_communicating_superdiversity). The follow-on funding would allow us to develop new collaborative partnerships that will ensure maximum benefits for users and allow them to achieve goals that they would not be in a position to realise for themselves. The four partnerships at the heart of the project allow us to co-develop new impacts directly related to pressing community and institutional need. We want our new partners and user communities to take ownership of the resource and shape it for use within their own contexts and allow them to produce scalable models and proof of concept for its application within their own spheres of practice and creative activity. We believe that this will both stimulate innovative practices and allow us to disseminate new approaches to collaborative working. We also want to facilitate inter-project mentoring and the sharing of best practice so that YARN can act as a means of building cross sector capacity and the basis for sharing impact potential amongst users.","This project will provide impact across a number of sectors and has been carefully designed in consultation with our four impact partners to maximise the effectiveness of our collaborative working. We have consulted closely with our partners to identify the key issues that YARN could help them with and have consequently built the four projects around those themes. At their core are the issues of digital workspaces, collaborative research, knowledge exchange, accessibility, inclusion and resource building.Through this process we have determined the most effective means of realising a defined set of aspirations for each group and broader networks of users and local authority service providers. The four projects provide these groups with clearly defined and mutually determined outcomes that are fully scaleable for other user communities and local authorities. Our key impact beneficiaries are: 1. Impact partners Our four partners represent a range of library, archival and community organisations whose core role is to develop collaborative relationships with user communities. They variously provide access to a range of archival content, library resources and provide leadership and training for communities in the use of resources for eduction, local history, family research and leisure.They are concerned with how best to engage with users through digital interfaces and how they can develop audiences and resources within an increasingly difficult financial environment. YARN provides them with an open and cost free platform through which to run projects and work with local audiences and communities to develop new relationships, digital resources and co-create knowledge about their collections. It also allows them to focus on key target audiences such as hard to reach communities and those with intellectual disabilities.The specially designed projects will enable them to develop such relationships and embedded the resource within their digital offer.It will aid them in evaluating new technological approaches to audience development and provide training and support for their staff and resource networks.  2. Public User groups  Our public user groups will similarly benefit from access to the resource and training and support to enable them to develop autonomy in the use of the platform, allowing them to research, exchange knowledge, showcase expertise and participate in collaborative projects in open partnership with local authority and heritage providers. They will be able to use heritage materials free from copyright restrictions and have access to resources that have previously been denied or had become unavailable due to web degradation. It will allow for the development of new user communities built around a number of foci including local history, cultural interests, news stories, hobbies and creative practice. It will foster and encourage creative thinking, self-reflective storytelling, and broader social participation. We will be particularly focusing on often hard to reach or isolated user communities and will seek to identify potential future impact activities related related to these audiences- for example in terms of the educational or therapeutic potential of this resource. 3. Local authority, archive and heritage professionals These projects and the associated training materials will be of broader interest to these professionals and a key aim of these activities is to offer mentorship and scalability to new user and professional communities and to rollout the resource through our partner networks and professional organisations. YARN will provide an ongoing and developing series of resources and a focus for reporting the progress of projects. It will also provide access to new bodies of archival content for public and professional use to allow us to disseminate best practice and encourage project-based conversations and mentorship opportunities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP005918%2F1

"Funding details                                                                                                              Current global trends in meat consumption are unsustainable, with large-scale livestock production carrying significant environmental costs - greenhouse gas emissions, land and water usage, and animal health and welfare concerns. Man Food is a project that brings together community partners with university researchers to explore questions around food and the environment, specifically in relation to men's consumption practices. The project is not about directly changing men's behaviour, but rather about seeing if there are different ways in which men can relate to food that might benefit health, lifestyle and the environment. It comes out of two previous projects looking at food and community, and involves a series of food workshops with men, the production of a new art performance, a toolkit for organisations that addresses the project's central concerns, and a series of discussion lunches as part of Healthy City Week in Bristol.  Researchers Emma Roe and Paul Hurley are employing an approach they call ""becoming an ecological citizen"", as a way of thinking about the individual's relationship to the environment as one of citizenship rather than purely of (ethical) consumerism. It employs a hands-on and creative approach to connect people to issues like food through activities like cooking and eating. This enables different conversations to take place that might enable people to rethink their practices and beliefs around food. In the context of Man Food, we are interested in how this approach might be applied to men, in thinking about protein diversification - eating a range of protein like vegetables, beans, eggs and fish, as well as / instead of meat - to support organisations keen to address men's food choices in relation to personal health and environmentally-motivated behaviours. The university researchers will work in partnership with Windmill Hill City Farm, a charity that provides educational, recreational and therapeutic activities by giving the local community opportunities to experience farming in the heart of the city. Along with Knowle West Health Park's group Man Alive, the farm will be involved in the development of a series of food workshops with men from a range of backgrounds across Bristol.  Man Food will also have an artist working on the project, who will use video and other approaches to creatively respond to ideas emerging in the interactive workshops. These will form the basis of an art performance created for the At-Bristol planetarium, a video of which will also be available on the Man Food website.  Over the course of the project, the team will develop the 'becoming an ecological citizen' approach in specific relation to men and protein, and will produce a toolkit, available digitally, for other organisations wanting to explore similar ideas and activities. Central to the researchers' way of working is to be in dialogue with WHCF and KWHP, to ensure outputs like the toolkit and workshops are the most relevant and useful they can be. The team will also work to open up conversations around this subject (from this project as well as from the learning from previous projects on which it builds), through public discussion events called Man Food Picnics, during Healthy City Week. It will also extend conversations through social media and through relationships with other organisations, like At-Bristol, Flexitarian Bristol, Hubbub, The Matthew Tree Project and The Edible Landscape Movement.","Man Food builds on experience from the preceding related CC projects by maximising opportunities for co-design in the project process and outputs, and by using existing networks and partnerships to identify needs and to deliver pathways to impact for a range of stakeholders and end-users. These pathways will be primarily through innovative public engagement activities with non-academic audiences, realised through two-way relationships with organisations. Separate pathways to academic impact will be delivered through the collaborative nature of the project. Social impact: A) Community Partners: 1. Windmill Hill City Farm (WHCF): - engaging new users from both white and BAME communities - developing new understandings of relationship between food and environment, for application in education work or in cafe - develop ways of working with artists 2. Knowle West Health Park (KWHP) / Man Alive: - new interactive and social activities for Man Alive - new relationships with other partners (WHCF, HCW) - broader applied knowledge about approaches to public health and eco citzenship 3. At-Bristol: - new partnerships and forms of audience engagement - extend learning from food / environment work with children to adults - engaging new audiences - innovative material and high-quality artistic events in planetarium 4. Healthy City Week: - novel co-produced research project in programme - new experimental art performance bringing new audience to HCW programme - opportunity to connect project to new audiences and organisations in the city 5. Flexitarian Bristol: - platform for publicity and dissemination - opportunity to extend campaigning and behaviour change work with academic analysis - public context for BEC methodology 6. The Matthew Tree Project and Edible Landscape Movement - opportunity to revisit original Foodscapes research - dissemination of toolkit shaping cookery classes or signposting of service-users around healthy eating and behaviour change. B) Community Members: 1. Workshop participants: - acquiring new skills and knowledge from each other - actively reflecting on food practices and BEC - forming relationships with other men outside of their immediate community, and considering their food habits in different contexts (e.g. gender, social and cultural traditions). - over a more extended period of time than in Protein Pressures, extending pathways to impact through secondary engagement with peers and family members outside of the workshops. - exploring understandings about gender and ecology, and overcoming barriers to inclusion in discourses and activities about environmental responsibility. 2. General Public: - bringing together performance audience from individuals interested in art, food, health and environment - inspiring conversations and action around food and environment, among men and among women - present a positive story of co-produced research - drawing on knowledge learnt from Hubbub, exploring the use of social media and / or pledge making around protein diversification. Academic Impact: A) University Partners - knowledge exchange between PI, PDRA and advisory panel - mentoring of PDRA (formerly an artist on CC projects) by PI - production of a conference paper by PDRA - co-authorship of a journal article by PI and PDRA B) Academic Knowledge - increase value of creative and arts-based methods in interdisciplinary research - increase development of food-based participatory research - create interdisciplinary knowledge about the relationship between masculine subjectivities, material food practices and ecological knowledges of non-human agency.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP009611%2F1

If honest, everyone can probably point to a situation where they did something like this. The same person might be a free-rider in one situation and a collective contributor in the next. What are the triggers of making one choice or the other? How do these triggers depend on social factors such as observations of behaviours in ones network or the overall population? What are the population outcomes of different social and personal dynamics? And what kinds of social structures strengthen or weaken cooperative behaviour? This project investigates the triggers and social settings of collective or individual choices and the resulting dynamics of cooperation.","This project is part of cooperation research and as such has impact in line with that research field. Robert Axelrod, in a recent anniversary talk of his work, characterised the three central questions of cooperation research as  1. Under what conditions can cooperation emerge and be sustained among actors who are egoists? 2. What advice can be offered to a player in a given setting about the best strategy to use? 3. What advice can be offered to reformers who want to alter the very terms of the interaction so as to promote the emergence of cooperation? In our case, question 1. needs to be rephrased to ""under what conditions can collective reasoning remain a sustainable choice of agents? And what are the triggers by which agents change their decision focus from collective to individual and vice versa?"" Questions 2. and 3. directly apply to our project.  Currently many incentive structures are such that they enhance personal payoff, e.g. bonuses, performance related pay etc. There are many examples in which personal payoff incentives have led to undesirable behaviour of the individual as can be seen from sub-prime mortgages or the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). This project investigates the possibility of enshrining collective behaviour and investigates the conditions under which collective behaviour can flourish.  The collective reasoning approach offers new explanations to two existing problems. First of all it can contribute to the understanding of the crowding out of intrinsic motivations by external incentives. The collective approach can be interpreted as a change of viewpoint on the payoff matrix from seeing the individual rows and columns to seeing the ""collective diagonal"". Offering money for pro-social action re-focuses the agent on the individual row/column comparison, undermining the collective framing.  Secondly, through investigating the influence of an actor's perception of the size of the existing coalition of co-operators on the choice to cooperate, the approach contributes to investigating the dynamics of phase transitions and self-fulfilling prophesies. Finally, research into predictors of positive behaviour has found that moral preferences are a strong predictor for good behaviour. Through analysing the importance of the perception of the group, this project can contribute to understanding what the reasoning behind such moral decisions might be and how this reasoning is triggered. It can thus contribute to formulating better policies than incentives to enshrine pro-social behaviour.  Enhanced understanding of these mechanisms and processes can contribute to the formulation of more effective policies for society, organizations and companies. Awareness of collective reasoning alone might change the perception of how to motivate people, while study of the extrinsic motivations can provide further, applicable information.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL007282%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Launched with AHRC funding in 2006, The Reading Experience Database, 1450-1945 (RED) is the world's largest single repository relating to reading experiences, now containing over 33,000 individual entries. It is an unique global research and teaching resource for the history of reading practices. A pioneer in crowdsourcing for the digital humanities, RED also has a proven track record of public engagement through the involvement of volunteers. RED team members have mentored volunteers to search the published letters and diaries of writers or historical figures for evidences of reading, and have trained volunteers to enter information from unpublished material in their own family archives. This has enabled a radical democratization of research in the history of reading, allowing interested members of the public to help locate, identify and enter the source material on which so much academic research in the subject depends. Reading and its history are topics that have wide interest to members of the public. RED as an open-source, outward-facing project has the potential to reach a much wider range of individuals and groups than was anticipated in the initial project design ten years ago. The main aim of 'Reading Communities: Connecting the Past and the Present' is therefore to reach out to a new generation of non-academic audiences - particularly reading groups - with whom RED has not engaged before and to take advantage of developments in social media. In doing so, we aim to bring today's readers into a closer and more enriching relationship with readers from the past, thereby connecting past and present practices of reading. This follow-on project will reach communities of readers through events in five key cities across the UK: Belfast, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, and London. Activities in each location will have a specific theme and target specific communities. Events will be timed to coincide with reading-related events and anniversaries throughout the year. The Belfast event is thematically organised around the question, 'Is there such a thing as a Northern Irish reader?' and will encourage members of reading groups to consider how Northern Irish readers have shaped their cultural identity through reading in the last 100 years. Events in Belfast will be timed to coincide with the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising (24 April; Belfast), a key point in shaping national cultural identity. The London event will encourage participants to think about reading during the Second World War. Working with the 'Ministry of Information Digital' project, we will bring together historical information about reading during the conflict, and through the oral history workshop, solicit testimonies and memories of childhood reading from people alive today. The London event is designed to coincide with the anniversary of the Battle of Britain (15 September; London). Activities will include workshops, public lectures, shared readings, a film viewing and a conference. The project will include the first-ever reading experience 'roadshows' in which participants will be able to bring items from family archives, such as diaries, letters or annotated books, explore their context with the help of RED volunteers, and enter the details into the database. Two oral history workshops (Birmingham and London) will also capture testimonies about recollecting past reading experience.","'Reading Communities' aims to reach sets of identified beneficiaries through a series of public engagement events. The key beneficiaries for this project include: 1. Communities of readers (including reading groups) in the five cities (Belfast, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, London); 2. Members of the public interested in family history and oral history;  3. Members of the public interested in contributing (as volunteers or providers of new source material) to research on reading; 4. Charities and community organisations (such as Verbal Arts in Northern Ireland and the Reader Organisation in Liverpool) that promote reading as a means of social cohesion and personal improvement; 5. Life-long and informal learners; 6. Academic researchers studying past and contemporary practices of reading. We aim to reach at least fifty previously uncontacted people at each of the events and generate at least 500 hits per month on the project website by December 2016. 'Reading Communities' proposes a robust, highly integrated model of generating new impact for the ongoing RED project. Promotional and publicity material about the project and its events will be produced in the first three months (December 2015-February 2016) and distributed in hard copy and online to targeted organisations and groups in each of the five host cities. The two short films from the day events at Belfast and Liverpool will continue to generate impact after the conclusion of the project, as they will be offered for screening at 'Being Human: A Festival of the Humanities' and made freely available on the project website and other media platforms. Revised papers from the one-day conference will be co-edited by the PI and Co-I and submitted for publication in a special issue of an open-access, peer-reviewed academic journal, e.g. Palgrave Communications. The oral history testimonies gathered by the RA at the workshops in Birmingham and London will be transcribed, tagged, anonymised and made available through the project website (assuming ten hours of recorded material or equivalent).  Throughout the project, team members will contribute blog posts to the website, which will be linked and distributed through the project's social media (Facebook and Twitter) presences. A comments area (moderated by the RA) will invite feedback and contributions from attendees at events and interested members of the public. Photographs of people attending the events and previously unknown material from participants' family archives presented at the workshops will also be made available on the project website with their permission.  Quantitative assessment of impact:  1. Attendance figures and expressions of interest will be recorded.  2. All online dissemination activities and pathways (e.g. blog on the project webpage) will be tracked with embedded analytics software.  3. Engagement through social media will be tracked and archived (e.g. Twitter through the tweet consolidation system, Storify).  4. Recorded audio-visual material will be made available on a range of media platforms (YouTube, iTunesU, OpenLearn), and all download, viewing and usage data will be collated.  Qualitative assessment of impact: 1. Hard-copy questionnaires will be distributed to participants at each event to record their level of engagement on the day; 2. Online questionnaires will be distributed through the project website as an additional insight into participant engagement to inform workshop design;  3. Narrative testimonies of remembered reading (e.g. during WW2) will be recorded by the RA through the oral history workshops (Birmingham, London); 4. Testimonies about engagement with historical readers from the past in RED will be recorded through filming (Belfast, Liverpool). Public participation will be recorded during the 12-month period. All online participation will be tracked and recorded for a 5 year period after the conclusion of the project, i.e. up to December 2021.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003667%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Grief is one of the most distressing, unsettling, and puzzling experiences that we face. During times of profound grief, the world as a whole appears somehow altered - distant, unfamiliar, unwelcoming, unpredictable. Other people may seem to go about their business in another realm, which one surveys from outside. Along with this, the deceased may be experienced as present and absent in a range of interconnected and tension-riddled ways. People often struggle to articulate and to comprehend these and other aspects of grief. Furthermore, lack of comprehension on the part of oneself and / or others can exacerbate painful feelings of being lost and alone. A number of interesting philosophical questions therefore arise, concerning what experiences of grief consist of and how grief, in its various guises, should be conceived of. However, philosophers have paid surprisingly little attention to the topic. Although grief is more often addressed by other disciplines, what remains lacking is a detailed, wide-ranging, cohesive, and concise account of what grief-experiences actually consist of. The overall task of this project is to develop such an account, by employing a philosophical method that combines phenomenological research (research concerning the structure of human experience) with work in philosophy of mind. The project will also draw on insights from other disciplines, including psychology, psychiatry, literary theory, religious studies, and cultural anthropology (supported by an interdisciplinary advisory group). Research will be structured around three main thematic areas: 1. Emotion and Perception: By relating the topic of grief to broader research on perception and emotion, we will (a) offer new insights into the nature of temporally extended emotional processes, (b) clarify how 'everything seems somehow different' and how this aspect of grief relates to the more localized recognition of loss, and (c) explore relationships between perception and emotion by analysing experiences of presence and absence. 2. Interpersonal Experience and Understanding: We will bring a substantial body of social cognition research into dialogue with the 'continuing bonds' literature on grief. The latter emphasizes various ways in which relations with the deceased are retained, rather than abandoned. In contrast, social cognition research (in philosophy, cognitive science, and elsewhere) concerns itself exclusively with how we experience, think about, and relate to the living. By showing how relations with the dead need to be accommodated too, we aim to open up a substantial, new, and important area of inquiry. In so doing, we will also investigate ways in which emotion is interpersonally and socially regulated, and clarify the nature of bereavement hallucinations. 3. The Bounds of Grief: We will ask what distinguishes grief from other forms of emotional experience and how healthy grief-experiences might be distinguished from pathological forms of grief and from depression. This latter issue is of particular importance in psychiatry, where there has been considerable debate. By formulating the most detailed and discerning analysis of grief-experiences to date, we will help to resolve the issue. The principal contributions of the research will be to:   * fill a significant gap in the philosophical literature, by addressing an important but neglected topic in unprecedented depth. * cast new light on a wider range of topics, including the nature of emotion, perception, and social cognition. * provide a novel and detailed analysis that will inform future research on grief-experiences in philosophy and other disciplines. * contribute to current debates in psychiatry, with potentially important implications for psychiatric classification, diagnosis, and treatment. * make broader contributions to practice and public understanding, by clarifying aspects of grief that people find unsettling, confusing, and hard to describe.","Anticipated impacts of the project fall into three main categories. In the course of developing an novel account of what it is to experience grief, we will: (a) seek to inform and support the activities of various practitioners whose roles involve responding to grief, by providing them with new insights into what grief-experiences consist of. (b) make our research findings freely and easily accessible via our website and publicize them widely, so as to enhance public understanding of grief and, with this, the ability to respond to it. (c) assist in determining whether and how typical grief differs phenomenologically from pathological forms of grief and from depression, thus making a significant contribution to ongoing debates in psychiatry, with potentially important implications for classification, diagnosis, and treatment. All three impacts will arise from the same set of research findings, and for the same reasons. Although grief is addressed by a range of academic disciplines, a detailed, wide-ranging, and integrated account of grief-experiences remains lacking. Formulating such an account centrally involves addressing a number of philosophically puzzling aspects of grief. For instance, it is unclear how experiences of the deceased as present or absent should be conceived of, how one's experience of the world has changed when 'everything looks somehow different', what the various constituents of grief-experiences are, and how those constituents relate to one another. Our project will do the required philosophical work. As the proposed research will make clear, how we respond to experiences of grief depends in part on the manner in which we understand them. Furthermore, our responses have potentially important roles to play in shaping how grief-processes unfold. Failures of understanding can exacerbate suffering, magnify a sense of disorientation and confusion, and make the world seem all the more unpredictable and devoid of comfort. Conversely, relations with other people can also play pivotal roles in processes of self-regulation. For instance, the co-construction of narratives that organize and make sense of events can play a role in lending coherence to the world and shaping how one engages with it. In short, understanding influences practice, which acts upon the relevant experiences in important ways. Hence we will involve a variety of practitioners in the project, in order to share our findings with them, learn more about their own work, and -in so doing- identify, explore, and actualize potential impacts. They will include therapists, bereavement counsellors, nurses, hospital chaplains, and employees of relevant charities. Given that grief is also of interest to a wider public who are affected by it and often deeply puzzled by it, the project will include broader public engagement, through publications, the website, the Twitter feed, support from the University of York's Media Relations Team, and an affiliation with the university's Death and Culture Network (which is dedicated principally to public engagement, with considerable relevant expertise that we can draw on). Commitment to investigating a wide range of impacts will be complemented by a more specific focus on clinical impact. There is ongoing debate over whether and how typical or healthy grief can be distinguished from forms of pathological grief, major depression, and other psychiatric diagnoses. Debate has been reliant upon and consequently hampered by accounts of experience that are insufficiently discriminating to decide the issue. Our phenomenological analyses will be more detailed and discerning than anything else that has been offered to date. The project will therefore involve prominent psychiatrists and clinical psychologists from start to finish, with the aim of making a significant contribution to the task of determining which psychiatric classifications, diagnoses, and clinical responses are appropriate, and when.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT000066%2F1

For this reason, 'preservation by record' has become a central ethos of the discipline. Yet, archaeologists have been slow to embrace digital humanities and most records continue to be based on numerical databases or 2-D photographs, exemplified by the Portable Antiquities Database https://finds.org.uk  The Science, Heritage and Archaeology Digital 3D (SHArD 3D) Laboratory will focus on preserving bio-cultural heritage by 3D record. It will then analyse these records, using techniques such Geometric Morphometrics, to develop new understandings of biological and cultural change.  With considerable institutional investment, Exeter has been gradually building its expertise in 3D modelling, microscopy and in particular Geometric Morphometric Analysis. However, since 2018, research demand has begun to outstrip both the available space and equipment. There is an urgent need to consolidate, strengthen and sustain our research capabilities which are actively integrating archaeological science, digital heritage and other strands of heritage-based research. The SHArD 3D project comprises upgrades in three strategic areas to enhance our facilities:  1) 3D Scanning  By upgrading our 3D scanning equipment to newer systems, we will expand the size range of objects that can be scanned, providing the full spectrum from very small objects to large monumental features in excess of 160,000cm3, such as rock art, as well as excavation trenches, and crime scenes. With portable capability for in-the-field research, these scanners will assist in the recording, preservation and dissemination of heritage dataset of everything from indigenous rock art in the Americas to the creation of a 3D database of small finds for the Portable Antiquities Scheme.  2) microCT scanner The addition of a microCT scanner will enable 3D non-destructive imaging of both external and internal features of archaeological and forensic bone, and material culture artefacts. There are few facilities in the UK which are suitable for the size range of objects required for cultural heritage collections, or which are optimised for archaeological materials research. This equipment would expedite the collection of 3D data for geometric morphometric analysis, and allow SHArD 3D to provide a new heritage facing microCT facility, the first in the Southwest, that we envisage will lead to exciting new collaborations with partners in the UK and internationally.  3) Confocal microscope  Acquisition of confocal microscope will contribute to experimental archaeology coursework and research including supporting an already-funded PhD project on human dental microwear. This will cover a range of aspects of material culture research including gross morphology and microwear studies on lithics, organic impressions, experimental archaeology, and ancient technology experimentation.  In partnership with the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS), these facilities will improve collections digitisation, and will represent an important step-change in the value of the PAS's 1.6 million cultural heritage finds. Partnership with forensic pathologists and commercial archaeology units also provides an opportunity to potentially support income through monetised assets.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX010252%2F1

It is practiced all over the world and, as illustrated by its incorporation into UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2010, it has already become shared international heritage. However, flamenco is still largely absent from wider academic and social debates about the most influential and as yet unresolved episode in Spain's recent history: the Franco-dictatorship (1939-1975). While there are well-known flamenco songs and interviews that refer verbally to the hardships and repression under Franco suffered by different artists, these experiences are not yet visible outside of the flamenco community. Furthermore, to date no substantial research has been done on how memories of the Franco-era are expressed not only verbally -such as through the lyrics of a song- but also in non-verbal aspects of song, dance and other embodied practices. This research gap is all the more remarkable, given that flamenco is widely understood as an expression of the experiences of poverty, persecution and repression suffered by the poor underclasses in southern Spain since the 17th century. If this is true, how, then, did flamenco help artists articulate much more recent experiences of persecution, repression and forced displacement under the Franco-dictatorship? Especially now that the unresolved legacy of the Franco-dictatorship is widely debated in politics, society, the media and academia while flamenco artists who survived the dictatorship are ageing and dying, it is urgent for scholars, artists and international audiences to understand how flamenco has been a medium to remember and cope with violent and traumatic experiences from the Franco-era.  This project will create a pioneering and interdisciplinary Flamenco and Memory Network with scholars, artists and members of the international culture industry to examine how memories of the Franco-dictatorship have been expressed through flamenco, and to find strategies to raise awareness of these memories both in Spain and internationally. In the first year of the project, two workshops will be organised in two capitals of flamenco in southern Spain. At Workshop 1 in Granada, the PI, Co-I, flamenco artists and local researchers will collate oral histories to establish in what ways the lives and artistic practices of the flamenco community were impacted by the Franco-dictatorship. Workshop 2 in Seville will explore more specifically how flamenco has been a medium for an older generation of artists to give embodied expression to their memories of the dictatorship, and how flamenco can continue to be a medium for younger artists to engage with the unresolved legacy of the Franco-dictatorship.  In the second year, a third and final workshop will be organised at the University of Manchester to explore how artistic expressions of memory in flamenco can best be approached from a transnational perspective. We will invite international specialists of memory, music and performance and directors of leading cultural festivals to explore the following questions: In what ways can music and performance be helpful to deal with painful memories? How should non-verbal expressions of memory be addressed in wider scholarly and public debates about the unresolved legacy of the Franco-dictatorship? What roles should these memories have in the transmission of flamenco to performers and audiences across the globe?  Contributions of all three workshops will be audio-recorded and made available on a project website with transcripts in both English and Spanish. The project will also lead to an artistic performance and to the publication of a Flamenco and Memory Network Report, that will be circulated to relevant cultural and political institutions. Finally, the academic outputs of this project will be published in a special issue on flamenco and memory in a leading international journal of performance studies.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV010573%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project attempts to enhance the sound of electric violins. It does so by modelling the resonance characteristics of the Octet Violins, an original set of violin family instruments built by Carleen Hutchins (1911-2009) with a greater homogeneity of sound across the register. This will be applied to Violectra electric violin (purchased as part of the project AH/D501784/1) as a prototype for assessment. The AH/D501784/1 project focussed on the development of the use of the instrument. It assumed that the development of the sound quality of the instrument was the manufacturer's business. PI realised in the subsequent years that current technology allows the player/user of the e-violin to influence the sound quality too as part of her creative practice. While the earlier research focused on the expansion of the musical vocabulary for electric violin by using digital sound processing, this project complements the earlier research by raising the standard of the sound of the instrument itself. It is anticipated that such enhancement in quality of the input material will have a positive consequence on the processed sounds as a whole.  The project has the following outcome events (in chronological order): 1. The publication of the new plugin and associated body impulse responses, August 2016.  2. A concert of improvised and composed music at the Edinburgh University concert series at St Cecilia's Hall, November 2016.  3. An improvisation event at Kyushu University, in collaboration with the Omoto Laboratory of Acoustic Engineering (OLAE), autumn 2016. The application of the new plugin in a public performance context, with support from diffusion specialists from OLAE. 4. An improvisation event at sound festival, Aberdeen, of the shochu-whisky soundscape collaboration project with Kyushu University, November 2017. The project targets users of e-violin (composers, performers, and those who enjoy music technology) by making e-violin more attractive - in response to the perception that the e-violin is still considered to be a poorer cousin of the acoustic counterpart, despite the challenges in using the latter in electroacoustic environment. The project is innovative in its choice of the Octet Violins as a model for sound quality: the Octet Violins, built by Carleen Hutchins (1911-2009), feature a homogenous resonance across the entire register. The Treble and Soprano Violins (the highest two of the eight instruments) possess timbral qualities that are very different from those available on the equivalent registers on the acoustic violin. Hence, rather than using a standard acoustic instrument as a model, the project aims to develop a virtual instrument the acoustic potential of which currently exists only as a preserved, historical experiment. The Musical Instrument Museums Edinburgh, Edinburgh University (MIMEd), is one of the two European museums with the Octet Violins and a partner to this project. Body impulse measurements will be taken from the instruments and the data will be used in simulating their resonance characteristics on the output of the e-violin. Since the 2006-7 project PI has used improvisation as a way to experiment new instruments and sounds (examples include collaborative performances with Parra Cancino, a recording of which is accessible at https://soundcloud.com/mieko-kanno-1/plp_i-2009-by-juan-parra-cancino- live-2010), and the present proposal continues to use this method. The activities utilise the knowledge and expertise of PI as experienced concert violinist and player of a number of different types of violin. The Harker (Co-I) brings to this project his expertise on convolution technologies. Harker and PI have collaborated as composer and performer, forming a shared interest in music for violin and electronics. Newton (Co-I) and the University of Edinburgh's Acoustics and Audio Group provide technical support in the measurement part of the work.","This project targets a wider community of electric violin users by addressing the basic need to enhance the sound of the e-violin. While the use of the electric violin by classical violinists remains within contemporary music (often in conjunction with the use of digital sound processing), the non-classical e-violin user population is considerably larger and spreads across many genres. By focussing on the sound quality of the e-violin the present proposal appeals to this larger community of e-violin users because it increases the attractiveness of the instrument regardless of the genre. The new plugins and associated body impulse responses (BIRs) are published online in August 2016. File formats have been chosen to maximise portability/access/sustainability. These formats represent extremely well-established standards for uncompressed audio (in the case of the BIRs), audio plugins and source code. The project reaches users and audience outside academia through its public concerts and performance events, which feature and promote the new plugin in a practical context. Each performance will be followed by a workshop to explain the use of the new software and its benefit. Improvisation as a methodology for exploration of this new sound opens up a new window for all e-violin users in any genre.  The performance events are curated by external partners (Edinburgh University concert series, Kyushu University, sound festival). These organisations have ample experience in promoting experimental music with electronics with their own network of audiences and users, thus maximising the reach and extent of the impact of the project events and outcomes.  The project also promotes the Octet Violins, which are played less frequently in recent years and turning into historical preserved (rather than continuously used) instruments. Anticipated benefits to the user communities - and the measure of success in meeting the aims and objectives - will be captured through the audience/user numbers and comments, software downloads, and further invitations for PI to give e-violin performances.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003691%2F1

These inabilities seem intimately tied up with the disturbing sec-tarianism of political culture afflicting Western democracies. But what precisely is it to under-stand another person and what is it that blocks the ability to do so? The project How Does it Feel? Interpersonal Understanding and Affective Empathy aims to make a crucial contribution to a theory of interpersonal understanding by providing philosophi-cal accounts of hitherto barely discussed dimensions of the phenomenon: (1) grasping what it is like or how it feels for another to be in some situation: phenomenal understanding; (2) en-dorsing or accepting another's feelings, motivation or action; and (3) achieving these as a result of emotionally or affectively empathising with the other, where affective empathy is conceived as either fulfilling a cognitive role, thus contributing to phenomenal understanding, or feeding into the evaluative or quasi-evaluative phenomenon of endorsement. Three subprojects will tackle each of these three dimensions. In order to do so, they will bring together and develop a thus far unique combination of insights from epistemology (on the nature of understanding and its relationship to knowledge), from philosophy of mind (on how people identify and grasp subjective experiences), from metaethics (on endorsement or appre-ciation of another's psychological state) and from philosophical psychology (on the types and mechanisms of successful and failed empathy). All in all, the project promises to develop key components of a theory of interpersonal under-standing, a phenomenon whose resources and value appear dangerously underappreciated in our factious political times.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT012781%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This research network combines the disciplinary approaches of historians and midwives to investigate the concept of childbirth ""risk"" from a historical perspective. The concept of risk stands at the heart of childbirth-management in Britain today, and seems to provide a suitably objective measure to guide practice and policy; yet the hegemony of that concept is open to challenge on a number of grounds. It is relatively novel historically, and post-dates most of the great advances in the technical management of birth; its theoretical meaning is problematical, as has been widely discussed in the social sciences; and in practical terms its application has led to paradoxes, such as the concentration of normal births in obstetric units designed to deal with difficult cases. The project will bring a fresh perspective on this issue by approaching it historically. Conversely, it will enrich the discipline of history by bringing the theme of risk into focus in the specific context of childbirth. The history of childbirth has flourished in Britain for some time (the PI and co-I are leading contributors to this field), but until now, risk has played at the most a walk-on part in studies of this theme. So too historians in general have been slow to take up the interest in risk that has been underway for a generation and more in the social sciences, through the work of such scholars as Mary Douglas, Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens. Addressing risk in the history of childbirth will help to open the historical discipline at large to risk as a topic. The core activities of the network will be three themed workshops, followed by a concluding workshop to plan publications arising from the themed workshops. The outcomes of the project will comprise a cross-disciplinary network; theme issues of two academic journals, one in midwifery or healthcare studies and the other in history; a mobile exhibition on childbirth structured around the theme of risk; a series of 30 videos of historical ""birth stories""; and the groundwork for further, and wider, cross-disciplinary collaboration. The first workshop (Brighton) will consider definitions, perceptions and conceptions of risk, focusing particularly on the historical development of the concept of risk and on the ways that risk is perceived, and conceived, by different constituencies. The second meeting (Leeds) will focus on representations of risk, systematically analysing different styles (e.g. epidemiological statistics versus individual stories), forms (such as visual versus verbal) and settings (including technical literature, the internet, the mass media, and museum displays). The third workshop (London) will be devoted to the significance of risk for each of the main relevant constituencies: mothers, fathers, midwives, doctors, health-care planners, policy-makers, and media commentators. The final meeting (Leeds) will be restricted to the steering committee and advisory board, and will be devoted to hammering out the shape of the two themed journal-issues. A key priority will be to maintain the cross-disciplinary perspective of the network within the (necessarily) discipline-specific formats of the two outputs. Engagement will continue after the project through two channels, with the possibility of a third. (a) A mobile exhibition, to be created in the Thackray Museum (project partner) and with the use of their collections, will be toured for display in other museums around the country. (b) Short (3-5 minutes) videos of historical ""birth stories"", each discussed by a midwife and a historian in such a way as to illuminate risk, will be made publicly available. In addition (c) participant Gemma Newby will make a pitch to Radio 4 for a 30-minute documentary, informed by the network, on the history and significance of childbirth risk.","There are five groups of beneficiaries: [1] Childbirth practitioners: Midwifery is not just an academic discipline but also a practical one, and a better understanding of risk will benefit all practitioners, not least because risk is perceived in different ways by the woman, by clinicians and by health services managers. Both midwives and obstetricians are pulled between the mantra of ""choice in childbirth"" and practice ""guidelines"" which tend to be interpreted as firm rules and thereby to militate against such choice. Thus ""risk"" works against choice, and since this tension is at the heart of practical midwifery and obstetrics, illuminating risk has considerable potential benefits for both professions. The obstetricians and midwives in the workshops will enable us to reach both these groups. [2] The general public, particularly expectant parents: Benefits to practitioners (above) flow on to parents, but parents will also benefit directly. Risk in general is poorly understood by the public, and childbirth risk particularly so; expectant parents are bombarded with conflicting messages, pertaining to ""natural"" childbirth and to the ""dangers"" of childbirth. An informed understanding of risk will empower mothers- and fathers-to-be to balance these conflicting considerations. As is explained in ""Pathways to Impact"", we will reach expectant parents in various ways, particularly through short videos of historical ""birth stories"" interpreted to illuminate risk. [3] Maternity services planners and administrators: A clearer understanding of risk and its complexities will be highly beneficial to those planning and running the delivery of maternity services, in view of the practical importance of risk and its ambiguities. Services are allocated on a risk basis, but the economics are undermined by patient choice, since even patients who are designated as ""low-risk"" tend to choose consultant-led units, leading to pressure to close down the (cheaper and possibly safer) midwife-led units - e.g. at Northallerton, North Yorkshire. Thus the balance between risk and risk-perception, which will be a motif of the network, has considerable implications for those who allocate maternity resources, and our profile of participants will enable us to reach this audience. [4] Museums: The Thackray Museum (project partner) will benefit considerably from the project, as will the many other museums whose remit extends to midwifery and childbirth. Because risk is the central concept in the culture of childbirth-management, there is a strong public need to understand it, yet it is a difficult concept to grasp. Thus museums concerned with childbirth have a need, indeed a responsibility, to engage with risk, yet risk is also not easy to display in a museum setting, because it is an abstraction and a subtle one at that. The PI and Dr Laura King, together with the Thackray Museum, explored these issues in a University-of-Leeds-funded pilot project in 2014. The key finding was that parents-to-be are keen to find out more about childbirth risk and believe that museums can and should help them to do so: they are not squeamish but rather are hungry for information. The mobile exhibition that the network is to produce will be the first attempt (so far as we are aware) to organize a childbirth display around the theme of risk, and will thus be an exemplar to museums at large. [5] The media: It falls to the mass media to mediate between the technical discourse of risk and the perceptions of the public. Rather than merely criticizing the media for superficiality, sensationalism and so on, the network will seek to engage constructively with journalists and to help them carry out their task responsibly. Participants therefore include both a historian of the media (Adrian Bingham) and a radio producer with extensive Radio 4 experience (Gemma Newby).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN006550%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The aim of this project is to use VR to recreate an approximation of the historical experiences (mental and somatic) of individuals consulting the ancient oracle of Zeus at Dodona and then, through user analysis, to investigate how such a recreation can help to advance understanding of (i) an ancient historical context and individual historical experiences of that context; and (ii) the design and deployment of multi-sensory VR experiences for research and educational purposes. This will be achieved by building a VR recreation of the ancient Greek oracle of Zeus and Dione at Dodona (the VRO). The VRO will, on the one hand, address questions of subjective historical experience by creating a convincing reality that will then enable the detailed exploration of the process, experience and effects of ancient oracular consultation; and, on the other hand, facilitate further research into the design of VR technologies for communication of historical experience, including both museums and classroom settings.   The VRO will recreate the experience of consulting the ancient Greek oracle of Zeus and Dione at Dodona in NW Greece during the Classical period. A broad constituency of ancient society visited this oracle: evidence shows that Dodona was consulted not only by community leaders, but also by ordinary men, women, and even slaves. This will enable the project to encompass a diverse range of ancient experiences. Moreover, the site has yielded thousands of lead tablets inscribed with questions that visitors posed to the oracle-remarkable documents for the ancient world. They show the everyday anxieties that prompted people to consult the gods, about, for example, travel, business and relationships. Alongside the question tablets, the ancient sources offer myriad possibilities for how the oracle worked, some focusing on Dodona's sacred oak tree, others on the priests and priestesses at the site.  This project will explore--and aim to recreate--the diverse experiences of consulting Dodona, by commissioning and working with a VR company to develop a virtual reality oracle (VRO). Using the question tablets found at the site, and informed by specialists in ancient Greek religion and divination, with further support from the Ephorate of Ioannina (near ancient Dodona), the VRO experience will be built around a set of stories about ancient individuals. It will evoke different contexts and subjective experiences of uncertainty and explore the various possible methods of consulting the oracle, helping historians to better understand and differentiate among these mechanisms. The design phase of the VRO will also be informed by the participation of teachers, students and museum/cultural heritage curators, who will help to ensure that the VRO excels in communicating information to different user groups. In the second half of the project, the project will investigate user responses to the VRO both qualitatively and experimentally. This will enhance the project's ancient historical research into the experience of ancient oracular consultation: analysis of user responses by psychologists and neuroscientists will allow the project team to gauge the sensory and cognitive affects of oracular consultation, and to differentiate between different possible modes of divination. User analysis will also be used to examine how VR may be designed and deployed effectively for educational uses in classrooms and museums. Once the VRO is constructed, analysis of users of the VRO by psychologists and experts in human-computer interaction will be used to better understand the role of all the senses in a successful immersive experience, and to establish effective design parameters for immersive VR environments.","This project has identified three main strands of impact, each of which will reach a variety of stakeholders, generating economic, social and cultural benefits. These are listed below, first by describing the kind of impact, then by listing the sectors that will benefit: 1. How: By providing innovative content to industry, public sector organisations, education and the public: The innovative product will provide cutting-edge, but affordable, content and resources for use in both museum and educational settings, which is also accessible for use by the general public through the project website.  - Who will benefit: specific VR company. The commissioning of the VRO will provide an SME with the opportunity to work in an innovative and creative direction, without the usual constraints of a commercial contract. We will give them the license to show this work as they choose, which will lead to its dissemination in both industry-specific and public contexts (e.g., as part of a show-reel or at public-facing festivals).  - Who will benefit: museum sector. Specific beneficiaries will include Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, We the Curious, Bristol, and Ioannina Museum in Greece. Kings College London's Culture Team will also display the VRO in a public display space on the Strand campus. These displays will increase cultural and knowledge capital for users, and we also expect there to be economic benefits for some of these organisations, since it will lead to increases in visitor numbers. - Who will benefit: educational sector. The VRO will provide a resource for teaching about the ancient world, for all courses that concern ancient cultures, in particular ancient religion. It will be particularly relevant to the OCR A-level Ancient History course, which asks students to learn about the experience of consulting the oracle of Zeus at Dodona. But it will also be useful for teaching in other disciplines that consider ritual, divination, questions concerned with living with uncertainty, and future studies, such as anthropology or area studies.  2. How: By enhancing the knowledge and creative economies:  - Who will benefit: the VR and immersive content industries. By demonstrating the development, production and use of VR for an educational purpose, the project will also have broader impacts both for the VR and immersive content industry, and for related creative and cultural industries. Not only will it provide an example of the use of VR/Immersive technology for educational use, it will also inform best practice, as a demonstration of an interdisciplinary, multi-sectoral project that brings together a range of stakeholders to develop creative educational VR products.  - Who will benefit: the UK economy. Such developments in the creative industries will also lead to the fostering of the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom. 3. How: By increasing public knowledge and understanding of i) ancient and modern cultures; ii) immersive technologies. - Who will benefit: members of the wider public with an interest in ancient history and culture, especially religion, divination and other rituals will be able to learn more both about the oracle at Dodona and more broadly about these larger themes concerning the content of the VRO. This information will be available both through the museum displays and the project website, and will be enhanced with public-facing events, including public lectures, talks at festivals, blog postings and related activities with the industry partner on this project. - Who will benefit: members of the wider public with an interest in immersive technologies. As part of the displays and on the website, the project will provide information about the production of the VRO, the psychological and neuroscientific aspects of its design, and industry practice.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT004673%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The material turn has come late to law, though it has shaped works in anthropology, history, philosophy, and science and technology studies. It is concerned with the roles that non-human objects play in human actions and relationships. We employ the term 'legal materiality' to emphasise that legality is not a determined status, but that legal power varies depending on law's specific techniques of representation, media and institutional settings. Such a materialist approach asks how material elements in legal processes, such as images or software, influence the persuasiveness of evidence or classify certain individuals into target populations. Moreover, a new materialist approach towards law explores the multiple ways in which law acts on different matters across society. Law becomes material by exerting tangible and corporeal effects, such as on the bodies of women, the ill, prisoners or refugees. Such a legal materialist approach entails the view that a full picture of legality is not to be found in legal doctrines and their textual interpretation, but across different objects in society. This calls for supplementing existing approaches to law. For example, a legal materialist approach provides a more insightful analysis of the 2017 executive order issued by the American president that sought to temporarily suspend travel of individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Whereas a doctrinal approach addresses the constitutional basis of the order and its interpretation by the judiciary, the lens of legal materiality places this text in the context of its material genesis, mediation and tangible effects: from the placing of words in the order, to the inscription of the president's signature on paper, to its digital dissemination through social media platforms, to biopolitical effects on targeted individual bodies and their ability to move across space. A legal materialist lens would expose the concrete genesis, media shifts, and the differential effects on targeted groups of population of the legal instrument in full. Understanding the meaning and effects of these steps requires critical analysis, drawing upon expertise from the humanities and interpretive social sciences, as well as a sensibility for the specific properties of legal matters: paper, social media platforms, border spaces, and human bodies. To facilitate such interdisciplinary analysis of law's social and cultural effects, we will create a new network of scholars working on legal materiality. The central aim of the network is to build a novel platform for exploring the relationships between legal processes and human and non-human entities. The network will bring people from different traditions in the arts and humanities (including law, history, literature, anthropology, media and science studies) who are working on aspects of law and new materialisms, together with artists and policy actors, to develop novel research approaches. The network will address a range of questions, such as: how do texts and interpretive practices relate to objects, bodies and spaces?; What are the implications of actor network theory and other new materialist approaches for legal scholarship? What are their limitations?; What resources can be drawn from the humanities, the interpretive social sciences and artistic communities to better understand the effects of new technological developments in law? Activities comprise four events, beginning with a cross-disciplinary event and culminating with an international conference. We will foster deliberative public engagement and exchange in the second public event that will bring into conversation academics, artists and activists who have worked on law's material forces, particularly digital surveillance and privacy. Through open exchange and dissemination, network participants will shape research agendas on law's effects within and beyond the academy. It will lay the groundwork for a new approach to law.","The section 'Academic Beneficiaries' details the anticipated academic impact of the proposed work. Beyond shaping how the legal field is researched and taught, the legal materialities network will generate impact by providing a forum and a unique resource for informed theoretical exchange and methodological exploration of why and how law matters for non-academic practitioners in the arts, humanities and law. Legal practitioners and policy actors, particularly in the field of international legal policy making and intellectual property, will benefit from this interdisciplinary research network by gaining a more nuanced and multi-disciplinary understanding of the ways in which their legal fields operate. Of the committed participants who will be invited as speakers to events, we will benefit from existing policy links and networks with United Nations (Sullivan), advocates for Canadian prison reform (Murray), transitional justice and truth commission proponents (Antaki), indigenous rights activists (Bhandar), U.S. based legal practitioners (Gordon), and environmental advocates (Otomo). Insights from anthropology, literature and media studies will enable different perspectives on the importance of legal material techniques, such as lists, filings and softwares in the construction of legal categories (Krajewski, Johns, M'Charek, Rouvroy). These insights will feed into policy practice by offering alternative tools for reflecting on what legal texts and traditional interpretive practices can and cannot do. The network will create a lasting and useful impact to members of the creative arts, such as artists, filmmakers and curators, who have been engaging with the often problematic forces of law that become manifested in concrete issues, such as privacy and surveillance, ownership of information, and access to knowledge. These problems require understanding the ways in which intangible information becomes represented by distinct legal language, how it is materialised within and beyond the legal field, and its concrete, tangible effects within society. The network will open a space for artists, journalists, activists and wider publics to interact with a group of interdisciplinary academics investigating the materiality of law. We have successfully secured the participation of the American National Endowment of the Arts Poet Laureat (Hu) in the network, who has worked on the material history of the cloud and will be in dialogue with artists (Norfolk, Paglen, Poitras) and academics (Murray, Weizmann) working on digital surveillance in the second public outreach event. This is planned be held in the Tate Modern, facilitated by our confirmed network member (MacKenzie) who is a Tate Exchange Associate. The proposed network will therefore generate a lively intellectual space for encouraging the open exchange and development of ideas between communities of academics, policy actors, artists and publics who are rarely engaged in dialogue with each other.  In addition to academic outputs, we will produce and disseminate materials that will prolong the network's impact and ensure a lasting legacy. In summary, we will: 1) create a project website for publicity and exchange of the network, including blogs and podcasts of conferences, as well as a resource page for teaching and research; 2) produce a project website, and publicise our network events in our own existing networks, including a social media platform of over 3,000 legal practitioners and scholars; 3) author a final accessible report for further dissemination through the network website, news outlets (Guardian), social media; 4) submit a commentary to a high circulation art journal to engage the artistic community, such as Art Forum, frieze or Kunstforum; and 5) document our public engagement event in video recordings through the project website.

"Funding details                                                                                                              Ships were both complex machines and also the embodiment of the aspirations, ambitions and hopes of the maritime communities which built and sailed them. Understanding and interpreting the archaeological remains of such ships, through the practice of nautical archaeology, can be a challenging process requiring specialised excavation, documentation and reconstruction of often incomplete and deformed material evidence. In recent decades, adaptation of 3D digital means of data-capture have become central to these processes and enabled a wider audience to engage with the research process and the outcomes of this research in both physical and virtual spaces. Most recently, a new generation of 3D digital tools have become available for nautical archaeology including multi-image photogrammetry (increasingly employed for survey of underwater excavations where time-constraints make more traditional forms of recording problematic), structured light scanning for documentation of recovered ship structures and individual timbers, and combined approaches synthesising high resolution laser scanning with photogrammetrically derived textures.  As with the adoption of any new digital technology, standards and guidance for the use of these new approaches are urgently required if they are to be applied appropriately. A previous informal network (Faro-Arm and Rhino Archaeological Users Group - FRAUG) proved instrumental in developing consensus, paradata (such as manuals and workflows) and broadly compatabile data layering at an international scale for nautical archaeology during the first two decades of the 21st century. As computational power within standard graphics workstations and especially mobile laptops has grown, so the use of co-ordinate measurement machines (CMMs) has increasingly been supplanted by laser and/or structured light scanning in post-excavation studies, or multi-image photogrammetry during survey and excavation. The FRAUG network, associated with CMMs, has become dormant in the last difficult couple of years. The renewal of an international network to test and develop new digital approaches is now urgently needed. The Digital Network for Nautical Archaeology recognises the fundamentally international and interdisciplinary nature of this endeavour. The ships that form our core study material were often designed to operate internationally, often crossed borders as they travelled across the seas (e.g. Mediterranean/ Atlantic/ North Sea/ Baltic) transporting people and cargoes, ideas and knowledge, power and diplomacy. During the initial two years for which AHRC financial support is sought, the network will focus on this European scale (reflected in the international make-up of its steering committee and the inclusion of an international Co-Investigator) but will also reach out to potential partners and projects on a global scale including the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, Africa, India, Asia, Pacific and American regions. The benefits and challenges of digital approaches to understanding our maritime cultures through nautical archaeology are applicable globally and indeed can transcend problems of technical terminologies of spoken/written language through an international graphical language. These benefits also extent beyond / cross disciplinary boundaries bringing potential authenticity to 3D reconstructions and computer visualisations in museums and the creative industries, making our research visible to an enthusiastic international audience. In developing and sustaining this network, we will combine web-based communication platfroms for regular international seminars with annual workshops where participants can experiment with and test recently developed 3D hardware and software. Early stage researchers will be encouraged to participate through provision of travel and subsistence bursaries.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX010538%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              'Everyday creativity' (EC) is characterised by day-to-day actions understood in terms of little and mini 'c' creativity; the former focusing on observable creative actions/products, the latter on more fleeting ""interpretive and transformative aspects of thought"" (Silvia et al, 2017). The boundaries of EC stretch well beyond the arts to a diverse range of immersive creative activities that millions of people engage in individually and in groups, at home, online and in the community. These include activities such as cooking, crafting, gardening, podcasting and citizen science. Such activities are often removed from established hierarchies, economic models and notions of excellence, but play a vital role in enabling people to explore their creative potential, maintain health/wellbeing, connect to others and to nature, learn/develop, and discover meaning/purpose. As steps are taken towards a wellbeing economy (APPG, 2022), these everyday creative activities become increasingly important. The proposed network pursues a research agenda that develops and supports understandings of this growing importance, facilitating the unfolding, broadening and democratisation of EC. This is a process of reparative discovery in response to what Jarman (1993) calls ""the theft of everyday creativity which the entire world should share.""  Since the emergence of the concept of a cultural ecology or ecosystem framed by the Warwick Commission on the Future of Cultural Value (2015) and the AHRC's Cultural Value Project (2016), there has been an increasing focus on the complementary role that EC plays alongside professional, subsidised and commercial culture and the arts. Eg. Arts Council England's 2020-2030 'Let's Create' strategy looks towards ""a blossoming of creativity across the country,"" arguing that ""the surest way to fill the future with every variety of flower is to recognise that we can all be gardeners"". What this means or how it can be achieved in practice remains somewhat unclear. Definitions of EC are contested, with little consensus as to how this is enacted/understood in different socio-cultural contexts (Villanova & Cunha, 2020). Further, as Crossick, Director of the AHRC's Cultural Value Project, said at an event organised by Network partner Creative Lives (2021): ""We do far too little to understand what makes that ecosystem work. It's become a slogan we talk about, rather than something we can really evidence the connections within."" Responding to the above, the proposed network will address issues around the definitions, scope, processes, assessment and impacts of EC, under 4 guiding themes: 1. The role of EC in enriching creative research methods 2. EC, the home and placemaking (including pandemic responses) 3. EC, health and wellbeing 4. Arts, science and technology interfaces in EC Through these themes we seek to advance understandings of EC and enable future research pathways to be delineated, while contributing to policy debates. The funded period will enable researchers from across the humanities, arts, social sciences and natural sciences to come together with creative practitioners, community groups and other key stakeholders through 4 participatory sandpit events across the UK and a final, concluding conference with international reach. Core network participants include Daykin (Prof Emerita UWE); Mansfield (Vice Dean Research Brunel University); Contera (Prof of Biological Physics Oxford University); Coulter (Director National Centre for Creative Health); and Simpson (Chief Executive Creative Lives). The group will collaborate to produce outputs including an edited volume, policy document and online articles. Following the funded period, we will consolidate and expand the network by forging wider research partnerships and associated policy impacts within the UK and internationally, and developing a follow-on bid focusing on the democratisation of EC in a more global context that takes account of decolonisation.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX004236%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The 2014-18 Centenary of World War I is of enormous significance, not just because it offers an opportunity to look back and re-evaluate the impacts the war had on the world a hundred years ago, but because it is the first in a series of globalised acts of commemoration that will define the 21st century. The 'Living Legacies 1914-18' WW1 Engagement Centre provides a meeting point between academics, heritage professionals, and communities, designed to capture and evaluate activities shaping the ongoing the Centenary of WW1 and engage those involved in its commemoration, while at the same time use this as an opportunity to forge closer university-community partnerships to assist a growing and important community of researchers whose interests in the past offer new insights into WW1 as well as stand as a testimony to the Centenary itself. The focus for Living Legacies is on the contemporary and continued resonances and legacies of WW1 in the UK, understanding how the war 'lives on' today, in different settings, across Britain and Ireland.  The Living Legacies WW1 Engagement Centre specialises in areas of research that offer unique and alternative insights into both the war and its commemoration, using methods and approaches from the disciplines of archaeology, museology, social policy, creative arts, geography and history. Looking at the past through the lens of the present, Living Legacies researchers are interested especially in thinking through how commemoration is complex (1) because it is a spatial act - it takes place somewhere - and (2) because conflict heritage variously links past and present, people and places, it is inherently contested and can perpetuate past conflicts into the present-day. Far from being the same everywhere then, current commemoration of the first 'global war' is very much localised, and made distinctive, meaningful and even contentious to those involved because of the very places commemoration occurs. The significance attached to the particularity of the place in commemorative practice is becoming very evident as the Centenary of WW1 unfolds within the context of a devolved UK, across 'nations within the nation'. Spanning England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Living Legacies is exploring this theme, of WW1 commemorative practices and transnational identities, by working with partners drawn from a range of public organisations and bodies across the UK, as well as local community groups interested in WW1. This involves having a close working-relationship with community groups working on projects funded by the HLF, especially as part of the HLF ""First World War: Then and Now"" programme. As a consequence of the partnerships formed by Living Legacies between community and academic researchers, the Centre aims to use a past conflict and contested heritage as a basis to build new and positive relationships across the UK, a shared future in which WW1 and its commemoration is not only better understood from different community and academic perspectives, but also creating legacies of the Centenary itself. These legacies will stand as a reminder to those in the future who wish to know how, in the 21st century, nations from across the UK looked back and remembered this most momentous of global events. To this end, Living Legacies research will result in a series of arts and humanities outputs, from scholarly works, to web-sites and digital data, to performances and exhibitions, all offering a deeper and more critical understanding of the impacts the war had on Britain and Ireland between 1914 and 1918, as well as a record of those who sought to commemorate and remember 'the war to end all wars'.","The case is made by Facer and Enright (2016) to see impact more in terms of 'legacies'. The ongoing work of the 'Living Legacies 1914-18' (LL) WW1 Engagement Centre has legacies at its very core, a defining motif that is being carried forward by the Centre in 2017-19 in our second phase of outreach and engagement activity. These impacts are embedded in the Case for Support and fully set out in the accompanying Pathways to Impact document. To summarise here, the key areas of impact for LL are: 1. Building relationships, 2. Changing practices, 3. Data provision and 4. Policy engagement.  These impacts will be achieved by LL academic and community researchers working collaboratively and in partnership on projects that are rooted in local commemorative practices during the Centenary of WW1. The wide geographical reach of LL, spanning Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and NE England, means that our co-produced research will bring benefits to a significant proportion of UK population, working with UK government agencies and departments (such as Historic Environment Division of NI's Department for Communities, Royal Commission for Ancient and Historic Monuments (Wales), Historic England, Ministry of Defence), and also UK policy shapers in the Centenary (such as Cymru'n Cofio/Wales Remembers, Northern Ireland WW1 Centenary Committee, and the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council), and major cultural institutions (such as Imperial War Museums, National Library of Wales, National Library of Scotland, and National Museums Northern Ireland). Local and regional partnerships are also very important for LL in Phase 2 as they have been in Phase 1. Together, these partnerships form the framework for LL contribution to culture and society in the UK, building relationships between communities and organisations, and using the Centenary and commemoration of WW1 to strengthen community participation and involvement in decision-making and policy, whether at the local, regional or national level. As well as creating new networks and collaborations, a significant area of legacy targeted by LL research is to deepen community understanding of WW1 and its impacts and contemporary resonances by embedding more critical, nuanced and reflective approaches and methods. LL is achieving this by taking innovative and alternative perspectives on WW1, drawing on academic research and areas of specialisation that offer particular scope to challenge normative and dominant views of the war, and at the same time draw out from communities hidden and sometimes contested narratives and commemorative practices, to enhance community engagement with the Centenary of WW1 and its commemoration as well as securing wider public impacts as a result of projects focused on WW1 impacts and heritage. Here LL's collaboration with HLF funded community projects is key, and in 2017-19 a programme of greater HLF project support and engagement is set out in the Vision statement by the 5 Centres, including Discovery Days for HLF groups, and direct funded specialise research support from LL to connect university and community researchers more closely and productively in Phase 2.  As a result of this closer community engagement activity over 2017-19, LL will be able to continue to build on foundations laid in Phase 1 and so yield greater benefits for our partners, scaling up activities to the mutual benefit of all. The legacies of these engagements will include a more critically- and analytically-minded body of community researchers, who once the Centenary of WW1 is over in 2018 will be better equipped and more confident to be able to develop further projects, including those relating to HLF programmes, on cognate heritage topics, particularly in their localities, and have also the capacity to work with university partners on these projects, and networks through which to achieve greater impacts and legacies themselves.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP006671%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project, led by Prof Tim Crawford in the Computing Department of Goldsmiths College, University of London, brings together 15 researchers to effect a Digital Transformation of the discipline of musicology. It is an opportunity to transform the discipline's impact and status by recognising the full implications of its multidisciplinary nature and taking advantage of the potentials of technology for studying the vast musical resources of the internet.  The world of music has been already transformed by the digital revolution. The same technology that has given unprecedented access to music for a vast and ever-growing international audience can open musicology up to the world - anyone and everyone can contribute by a variety of means enabled by that technology. We will show how the computational tools of music information retrieval (MIR) can be enhanced and adapted to the needs of musicologists, and how state-of-the-art developments in the Semantic Web can be exploited both to make their work more relevant and more sustainable, so that their methods can be easily re-used on new data. This project will stimulate creativity through multidisciplinary collaborative working. In the past, musicologists have tended to be lone scholars; regular collaboration in a multidisciplinary research environment will in future be essential for them to find what is ""interesting"" in potentially huge collections of music. We shall be using MIR tools in three main strands of research. Two of these are typical subjects for musicology and will be conducted by world-leading experts: 16th-century music and Wagnerian leitmotives. These will use state-of-the-art score- and audio-analysis techniques to extend the range of musicological investigation beyond the normal limitation to printed scores. We'll also be doing psychological work at Goldsmiths to study why leitmotives are so recognisable (or not). Our third main research strand is entirely novel, being nothing less than a prototype for a new 'musicology of the social media'. Music is now created, recorded, distributed, re-used and shared entirely online throughout the world and we will explore a whole new way of studying it and the online spread of musical ideas. We'll also get a group of musicologists to work for six months on their own research ideas alongside technologists who'll help to realise them. The fruits of this work will be presented at a public workshop and published online and in book form. These mini-projects will be launched at a networking/sandpit meeting which will be recorded and presented online. The website and blog will be used for dynamic and ongoing engagement between the researchers, the research community, and the music industry. Through this project technologists in the music industry will see that musicology helps them answer the needs of their clients by offering better means of access to the music they want to hear. The digital revolution in music delivery and re-use raises many crucial issues to do with creativity, authorship, marketing, copyright and commercial value beyond those normally associated with musicology. Combining the analytical methods of musicology and the power of digital methods brings intellectual rigour and empirical validity to these debates. Musicologists need this cross-disciplinary background to contribute most effectively and to create new and valuable roles within the music industry. Musicology should not be an 'ivory-tower' discipline; most people are interested in where music comes from, how it is conceived and made, how it affects us and society. Music goes on in people's minds, and the study of music is essentially about interactions between people. Because of this, music raises a complex mixture of philosophical, psychological and intellectual challenges; so it is a particularly fruitful domain for working through technical challenges which will be more widely applicable to the Digital Humanities and beyond.","This is an opportunity to transform the impact and status of musicology within the UK by recognising the full implications of its multidisciplinary nature and taking advantage of the potentials of technology for studying the vast musical resources of the internet. The world of music has been transformed by the digital revolution. The same technology that has given unprecedented access to music for a vast and ever-growing international audience could open musicology up to the world - anyone and everyone can contribute by a variety of means enabled by that technology. The discipline of musicology now needs to catch up. This project will be a primary catalyst for that step change, transforming musicology and stimulating creativity through multidisciplinary collaborative working. Regular collaboration in a multidisciplinary research environment is an essential component in helping musicologists to find what is ""interesting"" in potentially huge collections of music  We will engage musicologists to work for six months on their own novel research ideas with technologists helping to realise them. The fruits of this work will be presented at a public workshop and published online and in book form. We regard this as a vital component of the project's impact, ensuring sustainability of the outcomes and as a major way of engagement with issues such as IP and rights-protected data. These mini-projects will be launched at a networking/sandpit meeting which will be recorded and presented online. The website and blog will be used for dynamic and ongoing engagement between the researchers, the research community, and non-academic stakeholders such as the music industry. Computational techniques can take their place alongside conventional methods of musicology. They will transform the discipline so that it can begin to use contemporary and future online music resources for investigation, which it cannot do at present. To achieve this, at first musicologists must collaborate routinely with technologists to use their methods, but eventually these will become part of standard training. Through this project technologists working in the music industry will come to realise that incorporating musicology helps them to answer the needs of their clients by offering better means of access to the music they want to hear. There is real potential here for genuine Knowledge Transfer.  The digital revolution in music delivery and re-use raises many crucial issues to do with creativity, authorship, marketing, copyright and commercial value beyond those normally associated with musicology. The combination of the analytical methods of musicology and the power of digital methods brings intellectual rigour and empirical validity to these debates. Musicologists need this cross-disciplinary background to contribute most effectively and to create new and valuable roles within the music industry. Musicology need not - and should not - be an 'ivory-tower' discipline; most people are interested in where some kind of music comes from, how it is conceived and made, how it affects us and society. Music goes on in people's heads, and the study of music is essentially about interactions between people. Because of this, music raises a complex mixture of philosophical, psychological and intellectual challenges; so it is a particularly fruitful domain for working through technical challenges which will be more widely applicable to the Digital Humanities and beyond. By including three PhD students, who will benefit from joint supervision by musicologists and technologists, as well as 4/5 mini-projects bringing researchers from different domains together, this project is - as far as we are aware - unprecedented in its aspiration to pass on cross-disciplinary lessons to the next generation. This will result over time in a transformation of the musicological researcher into a multi-skilled professional with a wide range of employment possibilities outside academia.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL006820%2F1

WREAC's activities will be organised under three strands:  (1) Identities and Cultures in East Asia: focuses on (a) Chinese theatre and performance: building on the work of this international, practice-based network, the project will build further PGR capacity, disseminate research findings at network events, and develop a major electronic resource including film, photography and video of a series of Chinese plays and productions, critical commentary, and archival material from the National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts (Beijing); (b) Chinese authors, authorship and authority: through a new network of researchers working on concepts of authorship in China across different historical timeframes, the project questions the Eurocentric narrative on authorship and will provide a dynamic online resource for researchers, students and practising authors; and (c) an international (and cross-LBAS) network on memory in East Asia (and beyond) will focus on how communities use texts, material cultures, public events and performances as a means of mediating troubled pasts or rapid social change. (2) Cross-cultural Encounters and Globalisation: under the broad label of cultural diplomacy/soft power, one element of this strand considers the role of informal actors in East Asian international relations, while another considers various aspects of Chinese, Japanese and Korean soft power and its influence in other parts of the world. The theme of religions in Asia forms another element, through collaboration with BICC on a network which explores changing forms of religious authority in Asia against a backdrop of social change.  (3) Networks in Chinese and Japanese language and cultural training: this strand builds on the training element of our provision by expanding further the international network of supervisors of research students in Teaching Chinese as a Second Language (TCSL), with an international conference for supervisors on the one hand, and a student-led symposium on the other; in addition, resources for teaching and training purposes, and an edited volume representing cutting-edge research in the field of TCSL will be important outputs. In Japanese language training, we will build up our collection of online materials for PGT/PGR students, facilitating the transition to self-directed, self-motivated study with the inclusion of digital materials and new learning tools. The Staging China and Writing Chinese projects will also include substantial language and cultural training elements in the form of online, bilingual resources aimed, in both cases, at advanced learners of Chinese, as well as non-academic users.","WREAC's activities in its current phase have maximised impact through internships, placements and partnerships, while also sustaining national capacity in East Asian studies and advanced language through training events, workshops, conferences, and the development of language materials. In the next phase, existing projects will consolidate links and develop networks further, while new projects will provide fresh opportunities for knowledge exchange and public engagement. Non-academic beneficiaries will include theatres and theatre practitioners, museums and schools, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Chinese authors, literary agencies and associations, and users of our web-based resources. 1. Identities and Cultures in East Asia Staging China network activities will continue to epitomize the value of dialogue between researchers and practitioners, and the mutually-reinforcing nature of theory and practice. The network will extend the reach and significance of its impact still further with the creation of an unique electronic repository of stage productions with bilingual annotations and critical essays to be used by researchers who need primary resources, and by practitioners who want to stage a Chinese work. The repository will be a 'living resource' to be sustained beyond the funding period and, therefore, will have lasting impact. Writing Chinese, a new project, will impact beyond academia through the placing of an intern in a Hong-Kong based literary agency; and by drawing Chinese authors directly into dialogue and discussions with the academics, literary theorists and critics who write about or study them through a guest lecture series, an international workshop, and talks (including readings and Q&A sessions) at the International Writers at Leeds (IWaL) series organised by the University of Leeds in partnership with the City of Leeds Library. The guest lecture series and IWaL talks, in particular, will enable the Chinese authors to reach an audience that would otherwise be inaccessible to them, and likewise, will introduce the general public to new genres of Chinese literature (translations will be undertaken by postgraduate interns). Ruptured Pasts, Uncertain Futures will promote knowledge exchange with local museums (such as the Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust and the Weston Park Museum), the Historical Association and the University of the Third Age and with other external partners to be nurtured through the University of Sheffield's Arts Enterprise/Ideas Bazaar team.  2. Activities undertaken in the Cross-Cultural Encounters and Globalisation strand will build on the WREAC-FCO seminars in the first phase, and will include a cross-LBAS knowledge exchange network and international conference, and an FCO workshop focusing on Cultural Diplomacy in East Asia and nation branding.  3. Networks in Chinese and Japanese Language The network of Supervisors of Research Students in TCSL is the first international network to have established both a supervisors and a students' association and is dedicated to a research and practice-based approach to TCSL. Since its establishment in 2012, its membership has expanded to include European and East Asian universities, and it already enjoys a reputation for attracting the leading scholars in the field of TCSL. The Transitions Japanese project builds on the WREAC's long-standing expertise in online and classroom-based language training across all levels, and will offer intensive summer schools and advanced language workshops to postgraduate students requiring specialist training, supported by innovative digital materials. Language and cultural training will also be a key feature of the bilingual resources developed for the Staging China and Writing Chinese projects, both of which will be designed to serve as advanced teaching materials for those interested in Chinese literature, literary translation, theatre and drama, and also as a cultural resource for non-academic users.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL006758%2F1

Some are hidden completely beneath later buildings or re-working of the land. Virtual simulations can illuminate what is now imperceptible, contextualise what is now isolated and incongruous and can give us a means of connecting with people and cultures from which we are separated by thousands of years. This project brings together researchers and practitioners in archaeology, heritage management, virtual reality, soundscapes and education to create and evaluate a virtual simulation of the Avebury Stone Circle and Henge complex, part of the UNESCO Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites World Heritage Site, approximately 4,500 years ago. The project aims to develop a simulation that can be experienced as an on-screen virtual world, a visual and auditory landscape on mobile devices, and as a fully immersive visual and auditory experience for visitors using 3D headsets and haptic (touch) devices. Our particular focus is the sense of place and presence that visitors can experience through interaction with the environment and with other visitors, and how those virtual interactions affect their understanding of, and reactions to, Avebury today.","Impacts from this project are intended for 2 audiences, as discussed below. Academic and professional bodies. This project will provide an opportunity for heritage management organisations to consider how audiences might interact with the past in active ways, and encourage them to consider how museums and heritage sites might develop in the future. The findings of this project will provide information on the development, deployment and evaluation of immersive technologies in the heritage sector, and thus impact upon their planning and policy-making activities. The research team will gain experience of working together in a virtual space with an emergent sense of place, and we will share these experiences openly with the wider academic and professional community. Immersive technology developers will gain insight into working in multi-disciplinary teams that focus upon archaeology and heritage, which will impact upon their ability to develop their activities in this field. Archaeology researchers will have the opportunity to understand how immersive simulations can be places for experimentation in archaeological interpretation, particularly in relation to public outreach and encouraging public interest in archaeology. Also, our focus on 16-24-year-olds has the potential to impact upon recruitment to archaeology and heritage management courses, as well as the broader societal impact discussed below.  Societal impact Virtual Avebury will be on an openly available platform that supports full 3D immersive experiences, 3D on a computer screen, and access to the visual and auditory environment on hand-held mobile devices such as mobile phones. Participants will be able to access the simulation anytime and from anywhere with an internet connection from June 2018 onwards. We anticipate that most users will not have access to immersive VR equipment, so we will make Virtual Avebury available on an immersive headset and haptics set at the National Trust Barn Museum at Avebury for 3 months in the summer of 2018. This location is part of the world-renowned gallery and museum complex at Avebury and will form part of the exciting experiences the monument offers visitors, enriching its interpretation and encouraging visitors to construct their own meaning of this iconic landscape. This access will be supervised by project staff, where visitors will be encouraged to participate, discuss and evaluate their experiences.  By concentrating upon interpretation, accessibility, participation and ease of access, we intend that this project will have a significant impact on enhancing engagement with Avebury as a heritage site. Our focus upon 16-24-year-olds also has the potential to impact upon our understanding of the educational potential for immersive experiences of historical sites, particularly in relation to understanding the societal development of the UK over thousands of years. Avebury was developed over a period of approximately 800 years which saw significant cultural changes due to new ideas and new technologies, brought to the British Isles by visitors and immigrants from Europe and beyond. We will particularly encourage this age group to see the history of the UK as dynamic, multi-cultural and evolutionary as they experience history as a participant in a time of change, rather than a distant observer of the past. We will work with the National Trust in its education and outreach activities, together with Bournemouth University's outreach services, to focus upon participants in this age group.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR009260%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Cold War Camera aims to increase and deepen public understandings of the Cold War and its legacies in Latin America. Recent academic scholarship, and events such as the ongoing Efrain Rios Montt genocide trial in Guatemala or the late 2014 declaration of a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, demonstrate that the conflict remains a potent political and cultural force. This project proposes that photography is a powerful means to promote timely reflection on and public awareness of the legacies and memories of the Latin American Cold War. Its premise is that photography had and still has a key role in the cultural politics of the global conflict: through state surveillance operations; through deployment in resistance to state-sponsored terrorism; and by its role in commemorative and judicial processes. Questions of visuality - of what can (and cannot) be seen, known, and felt, - stand at the centre of the cultural politics of the Cold War and its aftermath. Cold War Camera is a collaboration with the Centro de la Imagen (Mexico's premier institution dedicated to the diffusion and discussion of photography) and the internationally-recognised Guatemalan photographer and activist Daniel Hernandez-Salazar. The project takes the form of three practitioner workshops to be hosted in partnership with cultural institutions dedicated to the preservation and promotion of memory of the conflict in lesser known sites of Cold War: The Museum of Memories (Asuncion), National Police Historical Archive (Guatemala City) and the University Cultural Centre Tlatelolco (Mexico City). These locations represent productive points of comparison: i.e., the Guatemalan genocide was ethnically inflected; Guatemala and Paraguay hold important 'archives of terror' and have undergone truth commissions, whereas Mexico's archival record is patchy and the process of transitional justice has stalled. The workshops will bring photographers from different Latin American countries together with professionals from the partner institutions, and with human rights activists, curators and academics to stimulate creative work that investigates what can be learned from the local histories, lived experiences, material traces of the Cold War, as well as its transnational connections. It will lead to a major exhibition funded, produced by and displayed at the Centro de la Imagen's prestigious Mexico City gallery to open in October 2017.","The focus of 'Cold War Camera: Visual Legacies in Latin America' is on impact-generating activities and engagement with new user communities and non-academic audiences. The following groups and organisations will benefit from and/or be 'users' of the project in the ways outlined below:  (a) Photographers: this project is aimed at emerging photographers from Latin America and presents a unique opportunity for career development. Participation in the project will provide a creative and intellectual environment in which to produce work in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team, to be mentored by an internationally-acclaimed photographer, to gain international profile for their work during the AHRC-funded phase of the project through the public-facing activities that will take place during the workshops; to enhance their international networks; to have their work curated by and shown in Mexico's premier gallery dedicated to photography; to gain access to a UK and US international platform through collaboration with Autograph, and the PI and Co-I. Participation in the project is likely to have a significant creative and professional impact on the photographers' long-term career development. (b) Centro de la Imagen and Autograph (ABP): these institutions will bring substantial expertise to the project at the same time as benefiting from participation through the opportunity to: enhance their research capacity through collaboration with the PI and CI; work collaboratively and innovatively with a multidisciplinary team to produce creative outputs; gain access to archives and cultural institutions across the Americas; establish future collaborative relationships with a variety of institutions and individuals.  (c) 'Sites of Conscience': this project will be carried out in partnership with 3 institutions engaged with the promotion of social justice, human rights and the preservation and promotion of memory of the experience of local inflections of Cold War. Through participation in the project these institutions stand to benefit during the workshop stage by gaining international profile for their work, both within the region and beyond; by the opportunity for knowledge exchange with similar organisations within the region and academics engaged with questions of human rights, social justice and cultural memory. As signalled by 'Nunca Más', the title frequently given to human rights reports, an understanding of past violence is essential to justice in the present and future. This project seeks to explore the ways in which photography has and can play a role in these processes and therefore serves to advance the core mission of the partner institutions.  (c) Public audiences: this project aims to promote an understanding of the history, culture and legacy of the Cold War amongst public audiences in Paraguay, Guatemala and Mexico. During the workshops, these audiences will be engaged through media coverage of our activities in each location and through interactive sessions with members of the public and the project team, where the focus will be on their experience and understandings of the local inflections of the Cold War and on reflection the often invisible but pervasive presence of photographic images and practices. (d) Police: this is a pilot element of the project in which we aim to work with members of the police in Mexico to prompt reflection on the status and significance of human rights in their daily professional lives. We will harness the creative potential and resources of the project team to devise a workshop that works through the medium of photography to prompt reflection on human rights. Through a focus on photography's pivotal role in upholding and abusing human rights, this pilot aims to promote self-reflective professional practice and self-awareness. If successful, the pilot will be developed and applied to other areas in Mexico and potentially, beyond.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN005864%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Within the context of safeguarding tangible heritage for current and future generations, 20th- and 21st-century oil paintings are presenting a range of challenging problems that are distinctly different from those noted in paintings from previous centuries. Problems are often but not exclusively associated with unvarnished, unprotected surfaces. Phenomena increasingly observed include the formation of vulnerable surface 'skins' of medium on paint surfaces, efflorescence, unpredictable water and solvent sensitivity, and alarming incidences of dripping paints several years after the paintings have been completed. The current lack of understanding of the nature of change in modern manufactured oil paints means that the established empirical approach to conservation treatments such as surface cleaning are not applicable to a great number of works. In particular, commonly used systems that rely upon water as a major component cannot be applied to clean modern oil paintings. So far, few alternative methods of treatment have proven effective and as a consequence the presentation of modern oil paintings may be compromised. This project aims at making a significant impact on our understanding of the reasons behind these phenomena by exploring several aspects of paint formulations (oil fraction, pigment-medium interactions, additives) and case study works of art. This will in turn facilitate the modification and development of surface cleaning systems that are more appropriate for use on the increasing numbers of unvarnished oil paintings in international and private collections. New cleaning systems will be trialed on works of art in several internationally significant public collections. This information will be disseminated via web platforms, seminars, conferences and a documentary for the general public and the cleaning systems will be introduced through continuous professional development workshops for practicing conservators, thereby offering practical solutions to conservators facing these difficult challenges.","20th and 21st C painting collections are now of global importance, exemplified by the increasing international demand for exhibitions in museums and galleries. Modern and contemporary art represents recent history and reflects the politics and societal developments of nations and the contribution of museums and galleries to global economies is significant and remains reliant on access to works for display. Thus the conservation and preservation of art is essential to maintaining this public benefit, and the outcome of the new knowledge generated by this project will have a direct impact on public access. While the outcomes have long term benefits to the public and private stakeholders by provision of access to modern art, the contribution of ideas and knowledge can be delivered to a wide range of audiences in a number of ways such as dissemination by publication and lectures in a range of media (print, web-based including Youtube films, public lectures, etc). In addition, the progress of research would form an integral part of education in conservation and conservation science (see Academic Beneficiaries). Through the same process novel high value tools developed as an outcome of the research will be implemented in the education of conservators, curators, and key stake holders in the public and private sectors. These concepts, research outcomes and practical solutions will be directly shared through seminars to ensure that more balanced conservation approaches can be achieved as quickly as possible. Scientific and conservation publications will be published and transferred via internet platforms including Tate Online and the GCI Modern Paints site (see Academic Beneficiaries). An international professional seminar/conference will be held at the end of the 3-year project where main findings and implications for conservation treatment and methodologies will be presented and discussed. Research content and tools will also be incorporated into professional development workshops for conservators and heritage scientists.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN504348%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The global economy is currently undergoing long-lasting, structural change, with shifting trading patterns, the rapid rise of new regions of economic growth, and tightening relations between countries. Yet this is not the first time that globalisation has redefined power flows in the international economy. The proposed network aims to provide a vital and yet noticeably lacking bridge between historical and contemporary ways of thinking about Britain's future global economic orientation, breaking new ground by examining how a range of opinion in Britain has been and continues to be orchestrated behind different and shifting conceptions of the nation's economic future, and illuminating the different ways in which overseas markets have, at various times in the past, been imagined, evaluated and conceptualised, as well as the implications and consequences of this for the way we view the possibilities and potential of these very same markets today. This project seeks to provide policy makers in governmental and intergovernmental organisations with the first interconnected analysis of the long-term development of Britain's key modern trade relationships. In order to do this the network will fuse together cultural, economic and political perspectives, in order to provide a deeper and historically grounded understanding of how governments and other economic actors in Britain have imagined three crucial markets - the Empire/Commonwealth, Europe, and China. In the first half of the twentieth century, many in Britain looked to its empire to promote a recognisably modern form of economic integration, while, after 1945, similar hopes and aspirations were invested in Europe and the Far East, albeit not always by the same people. The economist Joseph Schumpeter put the concept of imagination at the heart of this entrepreneurial process. It was this quality which, above all, businesspeople required if they were to succeed: 'the capacity of seeing things in a way which proves afterwards to be true, even though it cannot be established [as such] at the time.' In the same way as communities are imagined, so too are economies- making calculations about and placing faith in the future and its possibilities are key qualities of investors and entrepreneurs. Although somewhat neglected in the mainstream economics literature, Schumpeter's insight has found a strong echo in the modern discipline of marketing. Thus the network also seeks to combine a range of historical perspectives with the expertise of scholars working in the social sciences. This, in turn, will yield new insights not only into the history of Britain's political economy but also into the social psychology of entrepreneurship in the age of globalization. In the wake of today's global financial crisis, the question of how nations can establish, protect or even recover a competitive economic advantage looms large in the media, manufacturing, business and policy-making circles. As an exercise in 'deep history', the proposed network will generate fresh insights into the ways in which perceptions of international markets were reconfigured as a result of intra-European trade agreements, scrambles for territory in Africa and China, and growing demand in Britain for protectionist tariffs arising from intensifying industrial competition from Germany and the United States. It will further explore the extent to and ways in which Britain's economic relationships with the Commonwealth, Europe and China remain vital to its identity in today's globalised world.","The project has the potential to achieve a broad public impact by involving a range of participants and practitioners from outside academic life such as governmental organisations, learned societies and think tanks who are grappling with similar and related questions, yet speaking to different audiences. Our confirmed project partners are the Institute of Commonwealth Studies (ICS), Churchill College, Cambridge and History and Policy. The ICS is an international centre of excellence for policy-relevant research, its affiliate the Commonwealth Advisory Bureau acts as an independent think-tank and advisory service for the modern Commonwealth. Through its 'witness seminar' programme, Churchill College has been at the forefront of debating key events in contemporary history, participants have included former international leaders and members of British cabinets. History and Policy works for better public policy by developing links between historians, policy makers and the media and has recent experience of running public policy seminars with the Department of Education and the Treasury. The network itself has been put together with a view to closely involving a range of stakeholders from the outset of the research: project partners have commented upon the application, representatives from these organisations will be invited to attend all of the workshops, and key research findings from each of the workshops will be summarised and circulated among all of the project partners. The two-day workshops which include sessions for knowledge exchange will be hosted in London by the ICS and in Cambridge by Churchill College. The ICS are willing to produce a Commonwealth Advisory Bureau pamphlet discussing the implications of our research for policy-makers and the business community. History and Policy will assist in the staging of a policy seminar in London exploring the implications of the project's findings for our understandings of Commonwealth trade to which representatives of several business and governmental organisations will be invited.  Churchill College will provide support in organising the witness seminar and in transcribing and publishing the transcripts online for the use of researchers. All partners are committed therefore to working closely with the research network to share their knowledge and expertise. There will be two stakeholder seminars at the final workshop, which will be held in Cambridge. A witness seminar will give an opportunity to consult a range of expert witnesses who were actually involved in the events and processes we are studying (EC negotiations, the reunification of Hong Kong and China, trade agreements with China) and so able to provide first hand testimony. The final policy seminar, 'History for the future: Understanding export markets', will enable academic members of the network to reflect critically on the contemporary relevance of their findings, and, more specifically, to understand what are the key issues and challenges, ethical as well as economic, faced by government today in promoting and developing overseas trade. The main outputs from these activities will be: a series of oral history witness seminar transcripts, to be held by Churchill College and published online, and reports for History and Policy, the Commonwealth Advisory Bureau, and Juncture, a public policy journal produced by the IPPR. The advisory board for the network will comprise representatives from Churchill College and the ICS thus enabling partners to contribute to the shaping of the overall research programme and to engage with debates as they emerge. The board will also have the effect of developing stronger connections between the project PI and Co-I, the academic advisors, and a diverse group of organisations interested in the role, evaluation and conceptualisation of overseas markets in Britain's past, present and future economic orientation and well-being.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL003988%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Recent years have seen a large increase in the number of protests around the world which have challenged economic institutions and political practices, including the Arab Spring, Occupy movements, pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong, and anti-austerity movements across Europe. This project focuses on the recent protests in Turkey, particularly in Gezi Park in Istanbul. This project examines the aesthetics of protest, in particular, how protestors use social media to communicate their messages to the public and how they attempt to engage the public, politicians and fellow protestors. Protestors have a range of options open to them in order to have their voice heard and increasingly protestors use aesthetics in order to communicate their ideas. This project looks at protest aesthetics, which we consider to be the visual, material, textual and performative elements of protest, such as images, symbols, graffiti, clothes, art, but also to include other elements such as forms of rhetoric, slang, humour, slogans, as well as the choreography of protest actions in public spaces. Through the use of social media, protestors have been able to create an alternative space for people to engage with politics that is more inclusive and participatory than traditional politics. The use of social media allows people to share ideas on protest activity and deliberate with one another in an online environment. What was significant about the protests in Turkey was how images were shared across social media platforms in order to communicate the messages of the protestors, to unite the public and to challenge the unpopular policies of the government which had provoked the protests in the first place. The project will explore how the public and politicians in Turkey interpreted protest aesthetics and if they attached any significance to particular protest aesthetics, and whether these have changed since 2013, particularly in light of the electoral defeat of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the national elections in June 2015. The recent protests in Turkey are notable because protestors inhabited public spaces in urban areas and used public spaces to communicate their ideas, emotions, and interests to the public in order to foster support and raise political awareness of issues. However, the power of the protestors was strengthened by social media platforms where members of the public, who were sympathetic with the protestors or lived in a different part of the country or beyond, did not have to occupy the same physical public space, but could engage and deliberate with one another through social networking sites and blogs. Social media platforms are increasingly an interactive space which form part of the political world where people can engage with one another and potentially become powerful. Drawing on McGarry's research on marginalised voices in politics and his work on identities and social movements, this research will provide new insights into how protestors come together and make the choices they do.","The research will benefit diverse groups including: activists/protestors; Studio X gallery; V&A Museum; individuals in the creative arts; the media; policy audiences; the wider public. Activists and protestors will benefit from the project by inputting into the design of the research project including helping to formulate research questions and objectives as well as identifying areas of research which are meaningful to activists. The project's activist reference group has already specified that they are keen to understand how the political aesthetics resonate with the public which we will uncover through the survey and want to comprehend why protestors deploy particular aesthetics and how. Activists and protestors will benefit from the increased attention on Gezi Park protests and benefit from insights into how protest aesthetics are communicated across social media platforms. The website has the potential to act as a resource for teaching and learning about the protests which activists can use to promote their ideas. Studio X gallery will benefit from a high profile exhibition being held in their exhibition space focused on a key event in contemporary Turkish history. The curator of the exhibition at Studio X will build an international profile for his work. V&A Museum will benefit by hosting a seminar to discuss the findings of the project which will feed into the V&A design and protest series providing an international dimension to its work and will benefit the museum-attending public interested in the role of art in protests. The project will benefit curators and artists around the world by contributing to the digital galleries commission and exposing them to a wider audience including to activists and academics which will generate debate concerning the role of creative arts in protest including how protest aesthetics can capture and communicate the meaning of protests around the world. The media will benefit from covering the exhibition. We will issue press releases and invite key news media and current affairs reporters and cultural critics to a press preview to generate interest in the exhibition and simultaneously generate interest in different media outlets. Policy audiences will benefit from the website, blog and research updates which will document and inform visual aesthetics from protest aesthetics from around the world. The wider public will benefit from attending the exhibition in order to understand better how protestors shaped the Gezi Park mobilisation and why particular protest aesthetics were deployed. The website will also act as a learning resource for the public to understand diverse facets of the Gezi Park protests as well as generate understandings of protests around the world.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN004779%2F1

Over the past thirty years, transitional justice (TJ) models have dominated responses to periods of political violence. While such approaches are laudatory, they often conceive of memory and violence in static ways, as if reconstructing events to retrieve truth or facts from the past can set the record straight and promote unified healing. These top-down efforts often fail to heal social wounds as they do not transform systems of oppression, dispossession, and exclusion. Thus highlighting as the 'International Year of Peace and Trust'( IYPT) does, ""peace not only is the absence of conflict"". We, therefore, need to critically interrogate the use of memory and responsibility for political violence, recognising that without this we undermine sustainable peace at the heart of the IYPT. The IYPT notes the importance of a ""dynamic participatory process"" to foster understanding and build sustainable peace. Our research inquiry responds to these critiques and the call for participation by actively engaging in generative forms of memory work through our Transformative Memory Network.  Established in 2019 following nearly a decade of informal exchange and research collaboration between partners, the Transformative Memory International Network is a collective of scholars, artists, social movement leaders, community-based organisations and policymakers, engaged with the question of what makes memory transformative. Network members are from Colombia, Uganda, Indonesia, Canada and Northern Ireland. Our lines of inquiry and methodology build on knowledge exchange amongst Network members and partners around key questions: How do we remember responsibility for mass and state-sponsored violence? What do we learn from the strategies of powerful actors to deny responsibility? How does remembering responsibility shape present and future relations and ways of being together in land, community, country, and global politics? We address these questions by adopting a methodology that situates the work of memory in the web of living beings, relationships and places that co-constitute it as a powerful force field of action. Building on two previous exchanges (Uganda 2019, Colombia, 2020), we will host a MemoLab in Belfast in 2022. The MemoLab will interrogate memory practices and the research questions by fostering exchanges of knowledge that are place-based, reciprocal and embodied and through the use of dialogical methods such as theatre, textile creation, storytelling, mapping (and visiting the divided landscape of Belfast), visual engagement, soundscape and performance.  The six-day MemoLab will be hosted by Ulster University and partners and collaborators: Healing Through Remembering, Conflict Textiles, the Smashing Times Theatre company, and National Museums NI on their new ""Troubles and Beyond"" exhibit at the Ulster Museum. Healing Through Remembering will identify participants from Northern Ireland, including artists, practitioners, victims, former combatants, civil society members to join the MemoLab with international Network participants. The MemoLab will include a Graduate Conference, and space to work on six articles for a Special Issue. Concurrent to the MemoLab selected pieces from Network members and partners will be shown in the annual Dublin Arts and Human Rights Festival (DAHRF) and the Ulster Museum's ""Troubles and Beyond"" exhibit. Pieces emerging from the MemoLab (e.g. installation, poster art, music, poetry and performance) will be added to the annual DAHRF online exhibit. The MemoLab will coincide with the annual DAHRF (October 2022).  This will inform an a) exhibit that travels to Colombia, Canada, and Uganda after the MemoLab and b) research-creation among Network's members with at least 2 additional journal articles. The full results of the MemoLab will be housed in the current Digital Archive of the Network.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW009889%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The UK heritage sector wants to offer all visitors memorable, inclusive, engaging and enjoyable experiences. Museums increasingly provide access to their exhibitions, narratives and artefacts for everyone, with their evolving practice including accessible offers (such as audio description and BSL, audio-guides, interactive content and a wide range of community and educational programming) for people who cannot experience the museum in traditional ways. Yet, this reliance on 'access' provision to support non-traditional visitors perpetuates a dichotomy between 'abled' and 'disabled' people that marginalises non-normative ways of experiencing the museum. When museums provide alternative ways of accessing content for specific audiences, they unwittingly exclude from mainstream provision those people who want or need to access museums through senses other than sight. Consequently, even as museums aim to create welcoming experiences for all visitors, their assumption that sight is a necessary part of the optimal museum experience, risks alienating people who prefer to access and process information in ways that are not only - or not entirely - visual. A challenge remains: how can museums create inclusive interventions (interventions accessible to everyone) without having to spend time and money on also creating 'accessible' programming for minority audiences. The Sensational Museum aims to address this systemic issue by rethinking the role and place of the senses in the museum. It declines the orthodox classical assumptions of the fixed array of 5 bodily senses (that have privileged sight, and reductively contained our other senses) in favour of a new sensory logic. It leverages the liberating notion of 'Sensory Gain' and the idea that everyone can benefit from the 'access' traditionally offered only to disabled visitors. Consequently, the research aims (ambitiously and audaciously) not only to articulate what such 'trans-sensory' thinking and practices might be, but to demonstrate and test this approach within the context of real-world museum collection and communication - evidencing its value for practitioners, policymakers and standards agencies. It leverages inter-disciplinary research by bringing together insights and methods from museum studies, critical disability studies, psychology and design and embraces a co-creation, inclusive methodology where disabled and non-disabled stakeholders are involved in every phase of research design and delivery. It brings together the UK's leading professional bodies and standards agencies (Museums Association and Collections Trust) along with a national network of disability organisations (including the Disability Collaborative Network, the Accentuate Programme and VocalEyes) and a collective of 20 collaborating museums and galleries committed to creative and profound transformation of museum practice (led by Accentuate's 'Curating for Change' network, supported by the NLHF) as well as one of the world's leading cultural consultancies (Barker Langham).  This multi-partner project is not just a project about making museums accessible to disabled people. It is a project that uses what we know about disability to change how museums work for everyone.  This research will use a design logic to structure and drive its work. First, we will prepare a blueprint for a new sensory logic. We will then prototype an inclusive, co-creation toolkit and trans-sensory data model and interface, before piloting and evaluating these prototypes with museum professionals and visitors across the UK and finally refining and promoting the outputs in publications, conferences and at showcase events.  By responding to this systemic sector issue, leveraging inter-disciplinary scholarship, activating this radical concept of the 'trans-sensory', and following a creative and practice-led line of enquiry TSM will produce a radically new way of thinking about museum experience for both practitioners and visitors.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX004643%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Our proposal is to create for the first time a critical review of the existing research on the cultural value of architecture in the UK focusing on the architecture of the home and of the neighbourhood. 'Architecture' is not limited here to the activities of those with Royal Institute of British Architects chartered status. We refer here to architecture as 'design research' or 'research practice' characterised by the rigorous use of such methods as mapping, consultation, visioning, design, masterplanning and building. Whilst there is much evidence for value of architectural input in hospitals and schools, the value of architectural input in homes and neighbourhoods remains unclear partly because of the difficulty in setting up controlled test environments in these contexts. Other methods for establishing value need to be developed with some urgency as the architecture of home and neighbourbood has a key role to play in addressing important societal challenges such as the ageing population and energy use.  The critical review will provide a framework for evaluating architecture in homes and neighbourhoods that will help policy makers and practitioners to steer the future of the profession. It will focus on three interconnected components or aspects of value:  1. Wellbeing  2. Neighbourhood Cohesion 3. Identity Belonging and Heritage   As we are concerned with the aspects of architecture that cut across socio economic categories we will focus on ways of promoting wellbeing to groups rather than individuals.  An important strength of this project is the Advisory Group, including key figures from both industry and academia informing our debate with knowledge from a wide spectrum of viewpoints. The project is supported by the Royal Institute of British Architects and will provide evidence for their review The Value and Impact of Architecture.  Sitting controversially within the portfolio of the Culture and Creative Industries Ministry the value of Architecture is currently subject to debate. Indeed the government has recently appointed Sir Terry Farrell to lead a study on public policy, design and the built environment. This critical review will be used, via a briefing paper, as evidence in Sir Farrell's enquiry, in this way influencing policy on the development of the profession.  Architecture's inability to evidence its own value can in part be put down to a lack of formal Research and Development culture within the profession. The critical review will influence architectural practice by evidencing and promoting the value of architecture. Initially in the form of a database the critical review will provide the foundation for a series of publication, most notably the Cultural Value of Architecture Report aimed at architects, clients and policy makers. It will draw together other reviews of this subject and provide an important benchmark for future research practice in the area of home and neighbourhood. The critical review will have an important impact on the development of architectural research methodologies which have remained hidden up until now, largely because practitioners rarely articulate what they do in terms of research. Architecture is not just about building, architects are adept at articulating and developing design proposals based on the spatial configuration and visualisation of complex sets of information (quantitative and qualitative). The project will give greater exposure to the methodologies of architecture through the wider Cultural Value project. It will also provide opportunities for the development of new blended methodologies developed through interdisciplinary interaction.","If it can be shown conclusively that by improving the quality of the environment in homes and communities we can improve wellbeing the impact could be wide reaching in scope and would have the potential to improve the quality of our built environment. In writing the project we have identified four different audiences for our research: policy makers, practitioners, the wider public as well as the academic audience discussed above. 1. Policy Makers The future of architecture is currently subject to much debate in the UK. The critical review will contribute to two specific enquiries. The government has recently appointed Sir Terry Farrell to lead a study on public policy, design and the built environment. Sir Farrell's office is supportive of our application as they understand that the critical review will provide importance evidence for the enquiry which will be taking place over the coming year. The critical review therefore has the potential for very wide impact on the built environment.  The critical review will also contribute to the Royal Institute of British Architect's report The Value and Impact of Architecture prepared in response to the RIBA strategic plan, Leading Architecture 2012 - 16 due to be delivered at the end of 2014. Our findings are therefore likely to influence the future direction of the profession. 2. Practice Early indicators from the RIBA Study of Information Practices in the Built Environment Sector (of which the PI is a member) suggest that although architectural practitioners are aware that peer reviewed academic research is the most rigorous information available it is the information that they are least likely to use. The review report will provide a framework of cultural value that brings together and 'translates' a whole repertoire of inter-disciplinary indicators and measures of cultural value in a manner that architects can readily use in improving the quality of their work and the way that the quality of their work to non-architects. In gaining a greater understanding of the meaning and importance of architectural research for the development of their businesses, it is hoped that there will be a greater degree of engagement with Research and Development from within architectural practice. The evidence presented in the critical review should persuade some architectural practitioners of the benefits of Knowledge Exchange with academia as it seems likely that most of the cutting edge practice based research on homes and communities has strong academic input. This work builds on the AHRC Home Improvements KE CE project the PI is currently preparing a 'user friendly' RIBA Practice Research Guide (published October 2013) to enable practitioners to access new sources of funding and information in developing their research.  3. Public Whilst the web pages and the twitter feed will be available to a wide audience we want to create another more accessible event to test out some of the ideas emerging from the critical review.The cultural value of architecture is of course bound up with public perceptions of the field. It is anticipated that public consultation, participatory techniques, visioning and post occupancy evaluation are methodologies that are likely to be on the agenda. It is therefore only fitting to stage a consultation, a debate and an exhibition in the School of Architecture Live Lab (due to open shortly in a disused shop in Sheffield city centre), the public engagement arm of our Building Resilience research centre. The public consultation will take the form of a Live Project. These are six week projects that take place annually with MArch students http://www.liveprojects.org/ The material gathered from this and the critical review, will be used by the students to create a guide to the value of architecture in creating homes and neighbourhoods directed at young people (paid for from University Widening Participation fund) raising awareness of the issues at stake.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL005395%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This research network explores the legacies of the Roma genocide in Europe since 1945, with a focus on working closely with Roma NGOs to investigate the long-term consequences of persecution among Roma communities. Roma are the largest transnational European minority, but Roma history is neglected in studies of postwar Europe. At least 130,000 Roma and Sinti lost their lives as a direct result of racial policies implemented by Germany, its allies, and other European states between 1933 and 1945. Yet far too little is known about the impact of mass murder and persecution of 'Gypsies' within Romani families after the war was over, and across ensuing generations. Our research will integrate Roma into larger historical debates about the legacies of genocide in postwar Europe. We will thereby advance a timely research agenda for future scholarship on the history and politics of Roma in contemporary Europe. We will also explore the relationship between current discrimination and genocidal histories. We will thus be in a unique position both to challenge current policy debates that frame Roma as a European 'problem' and to inform initiatives for public education on the genocide. The network brings together historians, policy makers, community groups and the general public to explore the social, economic, and political consequences of the Roma genocide for individuals, families, social movements and states from 1945 until the present day. Comparative and transnational in scope, our research community will include participants from eastern and western Europe, Scandinavia, the Mediterranean, and the US. This will enable us to explore the postwar history of Roma in the communist East as well as the democratic West and the authoritarian regimes of southern Europe. Both academic and policy objectives depend on co-production of research with Roma communities, foregrounding them as historical subjects and providing them with an opportunity to reflect on and contribute to the production of historical narratives that concern them. Through a series of four workshops, we will create an international network of researchers, a website, database of researchers, three public events, a collected volume of essays, and pathways to future research collaborations.  The first workshop (to be held in Liverpool) will ask participants to reflect on conceptual approaches to studying genocide and its legacies in relation to the history of Roma and Sinti. The second workshop (Manchester) will ask how memories of genocide have been shaped by continuities in state policy (such as education, welfare and policing), as well as in international organizations in fields such as migration and restitution. The third workshop (Prague) explores the impact of genocide within Romani families, drawing on ethnographic, cultural, and activist perspectives on memory, trauma and identity. The final workshop (Liverpool) will bring together contributors to the collected volume for a focused discussion of their papers. Public engagement is a core part of the network, and is shaped by our collaboration with Roma NGOs - the Roma Voices of Manchester community interest company, the Museum of Romani Culture in Brno, Czech Republic, and the European Roma and Travellers Forum - as well as the Romani Studies department at Charles University, Prague and the MigRom project at the University of Manchester. Our public events will speak to interested members of the public, as well as activists and interest groups.  The contemporary relevance of this topic presents an exciting opportunity for dialogue with advocacy groups and policy makers, including international organizations such as the Council of Europe and European Commission, and the new Roma-led European Roma Institute for Arts and Culture. To this end, we will produce an open access, online briefing paper to disseminate our findings to a broad audience.","The project will be in a unique position to instigate a change in public and official understanding of the Romani minority and its perception of its own history and identity, through a novel and innovative partnership between specialist researchers, cultural activists and members of the Romani community. It will have a long lasting impact beyond the academic community as it will help empower members of the Roma community to reflect and communicate their experiences and view of historical memory, and it will create opportunities for them actively to engage state and public agencies in such reflection, ultimately supporting a shift from the perception of Roma as an 'emerging' community toward a perception as a 'resilient' community at local, national and international levels. Thus the non-academic beneficiaries of the network will include policy makers, the wider community in Britain and Europe, and Roma communities themselves. To achieve these outcomes, we will:- 1. Include Roma community members in the co-design of our research network from the outset, as well as in the evaluation and contextualisation of our research insights. Our network includes the Roma Voices of Manchester community group as a full partner, which will participate in the design of our conceptual approach (Workshop 1), contribute to the assessment and contextualisation of research insights (Workshops 2 and 3), and disseminate research results to policy bodies, schools, and the general public (through three free public events with local authorities, educators, and cultural activists, an online briefing paper, and a video report summarising impressions from the Network posted on the project website). 2. Provide Roma community members with an opportunity to reflect on our network's research questions and findings. Roma Voices of Manchester members will organise focus groups with Roma communities during the first phase of the project, and our network workshops and public events (Manchester and Liverpool) will facilitate encounters between community members, local authorities, cultural activists, educators and the media. 3. By providing training and experience in research co-design and co-production, we will create the conditions for sustainable empowerment of Roma community members, particularly the capacity and opportunity to participate in academic discourses and government initiatives about Romani history and memory. 4. Build on partnerships with the MigRom project (Manchester) and the Romani Studies Department at Charles University (Prague) and create new links with the Roma Voices of Manchester community group, local authorities and schools in Greater Manchester and Merseyside, the Museum of Romani Culture in Brno, Czech Republic, and the new European Roma Institute in Berlin. 5. Use the project website hosted by the University of Liverpool to engage non-specialist audiences, using social media and email lists to build an audience for the site. We will draw on existing links with MigRom, the European Academic Network on Romani Studies, and the European Roma and Travellers Forum, to generate audiences for the project website. 6. Run three free public events in Liverpool and Manchester, in cooperation with Liverpool's International Slavery Museum, the coordinator of the Federation of International Human Rights Museums. The ISM has a strong track record in organizing public engagement events in partnership with the University. Live tweeting of this event, with a dedicated hashtag, as well as podcasts on the project website, will extend its reach beyond the audience in Liverpool. 7. Evaluate events through attendance figures, audience questionnaires and monitoring of social media, e.g. the network's Twitter feed. Website usage will be monitored throughout the project, with particular attention to those outputs aimed at a general audience. We will seek feedback from our partners through tried-and-tested mechanisms such as wrap-up meetings.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP007260%2F1

Working with the National Trust's historic property and collection at Cherryburn, the birthplace of Thomas Bewick, and our new partner, The Bewick Society, this project seeks to address the issues of legacy, access and audience development through two strands of work. Firstly, two artworks created as part of the MCAHE project by Marcus Coates and Mark Fairington in 2018-19 will be revisited to create digitally accessible versions. This looks to demonstrate the potential of digital forms of contemporary art and dissemination which, in turn, has the capacity to generate new audiences and make commissioned artworks more accessible. Secondly, we will work with the Bewick Society to create a new digital-first artwork that follows the intentions of the original MCAHE artists' commission brief for Cherryburn. This born-digital work seeks to demonstrate an alternative commissioning and dissemination approach, which again might appeal to and help to develop different audiences. The experiences of this project will be shared at a project symposium designed to stimulate discussion and debate within the wider contemporary art, digital, heritage and museum communities around the value and future development of digital platforms for the preservation, representation and creation of site-specific art practice. The symposium will be delivered in partnership with the sector support organisation Arts&Heritage. Why is this needed? There has been a significant increase in the number of artworks being commissioned for heritage sites, and the the sites commissioning work have become increasingly varied - from country houses to historic waterways. Major schemes have emerged, such as the National Trust's 'Trust New Art' programme which between 2009-2019 commissioned over 300 artists for 150 of its properties. Despite this, until recently there was very little research on the practice of commissioning contemporary art for heritage or on its impact for artists, heritage sites and audiences. The AHRC funded Mapping Contemporary Art in Heritage (MCAHE) project (https://research.ncl.ac.uk/mcahe/) addressed this gap. MCAHE (2017-2020) was an interdisciplinary, practice-led research project that examined the role, scope and practice of commissioning contemporary art within heritage properties in the UK. The project brought together the knowledge and experience of academics, artists, heritage professionals, volunteers and visitors. Focused on a series of practice-led case studies which involved the creation of six new artworks for four heritage properties in the North East, key findings of the research included that contemporary art commissions could attract new audiences, provide important opportunities for artists to expand their practice, and can play an important role in public understanding of history. That said, it became clear that temporary site-specific art commissions tend to be poorly documented and have limited legacy. This is important for heritage organisations because commissioning contemporary art can be a resource intensive process, in terms of time and money, and yet its impact can be shortlived. It also has access implications in that only those who can physically visit the heritage site can engage with the artwork. These issues are particularly pertinent for heritage sites that might have limited opening hours or limited space.  What are the benefits? By enhancing impact and dissemination this project will:  - impact commissioning practices to consider legacy, accessibility & digital - further expand artists' practice - develop new audiences and enhance access - create better return on investment for those commissioning contemporary art.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX004279%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              'Capturing the Past' will turn a bespoke suite of tools created for the 'Small Bills and Petty Finance' project into a robust, re-usable and adaptable environment for the collection and management of historical data. The proposed system comprises four separate components - each of which has been developed to proof of concept. These are: first, an easy to manufacture 'digitisation-stick', built from an inexpensive clamp and a basic selfie-stick. We have manufactured and distributed some 60 'digitisation-sticks' so far. These allow a smart phone to be held still above a document, and for the phone's camera to be operated remotely (via Bluetooth) to avoid 'shake'. Second, we have created a phone app that associates each image with its archival reference, time, date and operator; and which then uploads the image to cloud based storage on the first occasion there is sufficient Wi-Fi for this to be done cheaply. These images are then collected as zip files and exported to a separate cloud-based data store. Third, we have created a data entry portal. This key element of the data capture pipeline starts with the archival catalogue number and allows the user to then both transcribe a historical text in full, and to describe that text using a series of pull-down menus to create regularised data about the content. Additional information might include geolocations, or archival information such as conservation need or palaeographical assistance. This information is then also uploaded to the data store and associated with the correct image via the shared meta-data. The data store then allows a regularised archival entry - and associated image to be exported to the archive's catalogue. This fourth element - the data store, in addition to storage, performs several other tasks including automated regular back-up, stripping of identifiable data to ensure the system is GDPR compliant and regulates the download of all or part of the data. The 'Small Bills and Petty Finance' project was designed to co-ordinate archival research volunteers to transcribe, categorise and catalogue tens of thousands of 'Overseers vouchers' - the slips of paper passed between suppliers of goods and services and Overseers of the Poor under the Old Poor Law. But, as we got to work - recruiting volunteers, establishing data collection standards, and negotiating with participating archives - it became clear we had a problem. Multiple volunteers, in three different archive services, each with vastly different levels of experience, struggled to create consistent, useable data. Our solution was to create a suite of digital tools that ensured each transcription was associated with a photograph and correct linking data. Our aim was to ensure this was laid out in clear and structured way in order to make the collection of additional information simple. The result was a bespoke Poor Law Data entry tool that built on the affordances of smart phones and the cloud. This follow-on project is designed to take that initial work from a useable prototype, to an adaptable environment that can be re-used by both public history projects, and by individual historians of all stamps. This programme of work proposed here is designed to take these components and make them fully re-usable in any archive or museum, with any type of historic document. To make them robust and usable; and to develop the documentation that would allow any historian or research volunteer to adapt them for their specific project.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV008064%2F1

Ideas of behaviour towards the natural environment, the countryside and 'ecosystems' - whether urban or rural - tend to lack a cultural dimension, or include the cultural sector of arts organisations, centres, artists and other creatives. This includes community cultures and local cultural amenities, amateur groups and activities. By using cultural mapping, where cultural 'assets' of all kinds can be mapped using local knowledge and various data sources - social/demographic, land-use etc and their catchments/usage, with accompanying visual images and comments 'from below' - a rich landscape of an area's culture can be developed, visualised and appreciated. This inclusive cultural base, which will be developed by this project, will be used to express how community cultures relate to their environments, how they are used and contribute to development and growth decisions and processes e.g. land use development (e.g. new housing, industry), recreation/tourism, heritage, conservation and resource use (e.g. water).  The project will build on cultural mapping and planning techniques and data/maps developed for area-based 'Living Places' case studies in London, Portsmouth and North Northants, and consult with these local communities and cultural organisations using GIS mapping-Participation workshops in order to test out and articulate this culture-ecosystem relationship; how the two fields inter-act and opportunities for culture-based sustainable development might be taken forward.  It is hoped that by applying cultural planning and mapping to the planning and ecosystem assessments undertaken by local and national government and their various environmental agencies, that the value of local and regional culture, cultural facilities and activities can be included in decisions over the environment and how we express our relationship and aspirations towards 'nature'. The project seeks to develop detailed guidance on how to incorporate cultural planning within environmental decision-making and assessment using the results from case studies, consultation and practical data mapping tools.","Non-Academic impacts from this Follow-Up project will be targeted at policy-makers, delivery and other end-users in the environmental planning and ecosystem assessment systems in the UK (England). This includes national government departments: DEFRA, DLCG and DCMS, Environment Agency as well as cultural agencies and NDPBs such as Arts Council England, English Heritage and local authorities/county councils. Impacts will be manifested in terms of the adoption and validation of policy guidance, the uptake of cultural mapping and planning toolkits and meta-data systems (sources of, and standards of data classification, compatibility and coverage) and the incorporation of cultural planning models and principles in environmental and ecosystem assessment.  Mechanisms to achieve and deliver these impacts are firstly embedded in the research project through early and subsequent consultation and engagement with end-users in central and local government, professional bodies, and through focus groups and iterative presentation of findings and recommendations arising from the research. Exploitation of existing stakeholders in the cultural mapping and toolkits and area-based Living Places case studies will serve as the basis for the project development, transfer and exchange of knowledge, validation and in the design of impact paths and opportunities for take-up of the research findings and resources. In order to maximise the take-up of research outputs in the form of guidance, policy and tools including case study material and datasets, these will be 'co-designed' and formulated in 'environmental' terms for easy inclusion in official policy and guidance, data protocols/metadata systems - including websites, blogs, advice notes, briefings etc. Full use will be made of online media and networks including KTNs (Environment), third sector and environmental advocacy groups, to raise the profile and interest in culture and sustainable development and the role of cultural planning in environmental awareness and land-use planning.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK00414X%2F1

From academic accounts which describe the Stasi as all-powerful to cultural representations which show the invasive network of Stasi surveillance (e.g. The Lives of Others, 2006; Stasiland, 2003), the GDR has in many ways become synonymous with the Stasi in public imagination. But how did the citizens of the GDR navigate this presence and the secrecy surrounding it in their daily lives? How were they able to gain insight into its tactics and terror; how did they share knowledge about its strengths and weaknesses? This project investigates how different kinds of knowledge were circulated through social, religious, political and literary networks. It puts these explorations into conversation with a the study of how such knowledge was represented in the literature at the time of the GDR and how it was reflected on in literature written after the Stasi-archives opened. In doing so it pays heed to the role families may have played in underpinning or undermining networks and how information and understandings passed across the border between East and West Germany. The project is based on the hypothesis that navigating the 'public secret' of the Stasi relied on varied forms of political agency and gave rise to many kinds of political identity. As a result, it aims to challenge narratives about former citizens of the GDR as 'moulded' by the 'SED-dictatorship' and lacking the civic virtues necessary to participate in contemporary democratic life. The project combines oral history, archival research, textual analysis and ethnography to explore how citizens of the GDR could know the Stasi and how they shared this knowledge. It aims to use the resulting findings to engage in debates with practitioners in the field of public memory-work and the wider German public through two workshops and a touring exhibition. And it will bring these insights to history teachers and pupils in the UK at two school days. Moreover, findings will be explored in no less than nine academic publications by the research team. In the third year of the grant the scope of the project will be widened to the question of surveillance in contemporary societies at an interdisciplinary one day conference.","The impact plan has been designed in dialogue with key partners including: the German Federal Agency for Civic Education (BpB); the Commission for Stasi Files (BStU); and the Roncalli-Haus in Magdeburg. The project will benefit three key groups of people:  1. A bilingual pop-up touring exhibition created with advice from the BpB and BStU will allow members of the German public to explore stories rarely discussed in public. It will be shown in the Roncalli-Haus, Magdeburg. The exhibition and attendant events will be advertised through the extensive networks of the BpB, BStU and the venue itself. The exhibition will provide a platform for recognising past and present experiences of state-society relations, for exploring the circulation of secrets and social sharing of knowledge, and for discussions about the scope and limitations for political agency in different historical periods. Such recognition and discussion is an important aspect of civic education and for prompting active participation of citizens of all ages in contemporary Germany. 2. Practitioners working on the history of the GDR, specifically secondary school teachers, heritage practitioners and regional and national policy makers from Germany, and A-level German school teachers from the UK will be invited to a workshop run in collaboration with the BpB as part of their annual, national conference for those researching on Germany ('Deutschlandforschertagung'). They will benefit by having time to: engage with original research data that expands current understandings of state-society relations in the GDR; network and share best practice internationally with others in the field; discuss implications of the research for policy, practice and pedagogy; influence the development of future outreach materials from the project through these conversations. Local policy-makers in the federal eastern German state Sachsen-Anhalt will enjoy the same opportunities at a half-day workshop at the Roncalli-Haus in conjunction with the opening of the exhibition. 3. Pedagogical materials produced as a result of the exhibition and workshops will be shared via the extensive networks of the project partners and through an existing well-established website (http://afterthewall.bangor.ac.uk) thus ensuring sustainability and access. The teaching resources and exhibition will also form the basis of two school outreach days in the UK, organised in collaboration with the Midlands German Network and North East German Network, and targeted at students in years 12 and 13. The school children will benefit not only from visits to the exhibition hosted at the Great North Museum, Newcastle and 301 Broad Street, Birmingham, but also from exposure to new historical knowledge and from the opportunity to engage in debates about civil courage, citizenship and surveillance.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR005915%2F1

Mariners aims to create a new religious history of missions to seamen through a study of institutional archives, oral histories of present and past marine chaplains, and the visual and material record of missions in ports and places. It will illuminate the hidden histories of British seamen and seamen of colour, who have been neglected by both historians of missions and historians of Britain's maritime inheritance. Marine missions were once ubiquitous features of British ports, coasts, canals and lighthouses where their object was to save the drunken and lascivious sailor from themselves. They evolved into vitally important humanitarian societies which continue to support merchant crews around the world. Through partnership with the Anglican Mission to Seafarers (founded 1856) and the Hull History Centre, the project will open up the archives of major marine missions. It will investigate the London-based missions to lascars, the common term for Asian seafarers, including the Strangers' Home (1857), which have not yet been fully integrated into our understanding of the British maritime past. The work is urgent and important, not just because of the scale and importance of the marine workforce in the nineteenth century, but because many of the problems faced by the merchant marine, from low wages, to insecure employment, hazardous conditions, risk of shipwreck, piracy, disease and abandonment, remain just as urgent today. Research has been divided into three thematic workstreams, each with a dedicated team with the necessary skills and access to archives and resources. The first workstream will focus on British mariners, especially those who were clients of the Anglican Mission to Seafarers and Sailors' Society. With the support of project partners, it will interrogate the ways institutional missions grappled with local and global issues, including that of over rapid expansion. The second workstream will focus on lascars, who by the later decades of the nineteenth century made up to a third of the British marine workforce. It will assess the effectiveness of the few missions created to cater for them, and innovations such as the Liverpool and Hull missions for Indian seamen. Because of the sheer scale of the marine mission movement, the third workstream will focus on three port cities: Bristol, Liverpool and Hull. This will investigate ways in which local missions were integrated into port environments and the significance of their legacy today. It will address pressing issues about the status and future of marine missions in sites such as Liverpool, which in 2021 lost world heritage standing for its historic port.  The project is committed to ensuring outputs are diverse, accessible and academically rigorous. To ensure this, there are a wide range of outputs built around three key milestones: (1) the Mariners' website, which will include archival text, maps, images, interviews, and directories of people and places (2) the Mariners' conference, which will engage academic historians from the UK, Europe and South Asia to reflect and challenge our research questions (3) the Mariners' exhibition will tour Bristol, Liverpool, London and Hull and will form the capstone event for the project. It will include commissions from local artists, text, images, and artefacts chosen from the archives, including those from the Hull History Centre, as well as education resources. Mariners addresses timely and challenging questions about marine missions which currently lack scholarly histories and context. It provides a fresh analysis of the multi-faith and multi-racial merchant marine and the religious encounters of these working people.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW009803%2F1

The Knitting Reference Library represent an extraordinary historical, geographical and disciplinary range, including knitted objects, books, exhibition catalogues, knitting patterns, journals, magazines, photographs, postcards, personal papers ranging from the everyday and kitsch to the historical and technical. At present only a small portion of this collection is available to the communities that have demonstrated an interest in them. The objects collected by Montse Stanley, for example, are held in Southampton Special Collections, due to their fragility, and are not easily made accessible to community spaces (e.g. meeting halls, home, or places where knitters are meeting). In addition, Southampton has also hosted six interdisciplinary and international 'In the Loop' conferences that use the collection as a springboard for knitting scholarship and as a medium to engage the knitting community.  After last conference, the local community of knitters reported an interest in supporting the University to make the collection more inclusive bridging the divide between academic and public activities and knowledges.  The project will rectify this by using the additional capability provided by the AHRC CapCo award to create an innovative 3d collection that will allow creative practitioners to engage with the material construction and format of objects within this library. Established methodologies such as photogrammetry, laser scanning and Reflectance Transformation Imaging will be used to create interactive 3d models and replicas of the objects the community can engage and experiment with. This engagement will be facilitated by a series of co-designed workshops, supported by creative practitioners, academic researchers and an oral historian, which will allow the local community to re-interpret the collection. The collection will be opened up to new conceptual, material, historical, narrative, and biographical resonances. We will then integrate these findings themselves back into the current online collections, in order to produce a rich and user-led permanent collection. The local knitting communities involved in the project includes Knit the Walls, the Women's Integration Group and the Southampton Student Union society Hookers, Knitters and Stitchers as established and inclusive group with different level of expertise.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX001830%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Andrew Millar (1705-68) was born near Glasgow, apprenticed to a bookseller in Edinburgh, and settled in London. By 1730, a distinguished circle of Scottish poets, novelists, and philosophers had joined him there--and within a decade, Millar was the most important and trusted agent for Scottish and English literary interests in the newly-established British capital. This project will document and display the degree to which the Enlightenment was made financially possible, and indeed quite lucrative, through Millar's negotiations with readers in London, throughout England, and across the expanding Empire. Millar was an energetic promoter and fierce defender of his copyrights. For legal scholars, Millar's name is synonymous with arguments for private ownership of intellectual property that endure to this day. His social negotiations and the positions these spawned remain relevant three centuries later. Readers normally associate the Enlightenment with purely intellectual developments. But its cultural flourishing was made possible through social and business interests negotiated by Millar. This project will draw on archival, technical, e-learning expertise to collect, edit, interpret, and showcase these negotiations for scholars, students, and non-specialists. The results will enable fresh thinking about the creation of historical documents, the interpretation of the past through new media, and learning about history through reflection on its social, financial, and legal conditions. This project has three objectives: First, the completion of a book, titled ""Creating Enlightenment: The Negotiations of Andrew Millar"" (under contract with Oxford UP). Second, using an award-winning online platform run by Edina, the JISC-designated information service, we will create an interactive exhibition that will enable non-specialists to explore and understand the importance of social networks for promoting intellectual and artistic developments. These modules will also instruct users on how to identify and contextualize the archival sources that can now be found find online. Third, the project will host an international colloquium on the social and financial history of the Enlightenment in Britain, here at the University of Edinburgh. A considerable proportion of preliminary research has been completed. In the first year, the PI will consult contextual materials and prepare editorial notes and the volume's Introduction. From Months 13-18, the research assistant will transcribe textual material and compile the bibliography. Also during Months 13-18, the e-learning team at Edina will develop the online modules. The School's Research Office will organise an international colloquium, ""Negotiating Enlightenment: Sources and Legacies."" This major event will be hosted in the School of History, Classics, and Archaeology at Edinburgh, with contributions from our graduate students and colleagues, and funding support from external agencies. This colloquium will be held during the project's final month, which will mark the occasion for launching the project's interactive website, and submission of the book-manuscripts to Oxford UP.  The University of Edinburgh is a world-leading centre for research in the intellectual, commercial, and material history of Enlightenment culture. It is home to the AHRC-funded SCRIPT centre for research in law, technology, and intellectual property, and the AHRC- and RSE-funded Centre for the History of the Book; with the National Library of Scotland nearby, this project team will benefit from outstanding local resources. Beneficiaries of the project will include a cross-disciplinary range of scholars and students, as well as teachers and non-specialists worldwide.","This Impact Summary explains three key objectives of this project: * The provision of a publicly-accessible and interactive web platform that features this research and trains users, particularly secondary-school students, to make further use of its archival materials; * Organisation of a 2-day conference that will draw on resources beyond the University of Edinburgh and our project partner at Harvard University; * Development of shared resources between this project and The John Murray Archive (National Library of Scotland), and the National Records of Scotland, for enhanced opportunities to jointly-host public events associated with this project. WEB PLATFORM Andrew Millar is a major figure in British cultural history precisely because his social networks and business concerns enabled the Enlightenment to flourish through investment in collaborative intellectual, philanthropic, and scientific projects. In the same way, adoption of an acclaimed web interface will invite teachers, students, and members of the public, to examine a showcase of archival materials including Millar's unpublished correspondence, in their manuscript and edited versions, with links to authorial notes, contracts, finished volumes, and contemporary accounts. This will provide virtual tours through Millar's negotiations and outcomes, complementing the book's richness and extending its reach. The PI will work with our local e-learning team during the final four months of the project, completing the explanatory modules and data-input from the emerging scholarly edition. We will seek the modest required funding from existing Knowledge-Exchange resources to maintain this platform over the years ahead. Like a virtual museum or digital library, this part of the project will foster ""public history"" by enabling readers to browse and compare primary sources, at their own pace, with the choice of reading, listening, or viewing editorial explanation-with the scholarly editor acting in 'guiding' rather than 'controlling' roles. As sociologists of digital learning have shown, enabling public engagement with interactive platforms will encourage visitors to retain and return to the materials time and again. We are mindful of the technical and conceptual complexity of e-learning platforms for preserving and featuring historical documents. Accordingly, this project will draw on the expertise of local leaders in the field of digital pedagogy to ensure that our interface balances high-quality exhibition with accessibility, including the Digital Cultures and Education Research Group (DiCE), based in the School of Education. The platform and e-learning modules aim to respond to the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence (2011), particularly its section on Skills for Learning, Life, and Work, which emphasises electronic research skills and critical thinking about local and national history through independent research. TWO-DAY CONFERENCE The PI will apply for funds from the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Historical Society to host a 2-day conference, ""Negotiating Enlightenment: Sources and Legacies"", inviting papers and exhibitions from local museums and publishing houses, to reflect on the history and interpretation of literary careers and publication in Britain during the Enlightenment. This event would be hosted by the School of History, Classics, and Archaeology, at the end of the grant period. This event will see the public launch of the interactive web platform.  LOCAL COLLABORATIONS Apart from its contribution to learning and teaching beyond academia, within and beyond the UK, further impact will result from opportunities for collaboration between the PI and local centres with remits for Knowledge-Exchange: the John Murray Archive (NLS); and the National Records of Scotland.  The project team envisions exhibitions, open-access publications, hands-on workshops for teachers, and contributions to University's Visitor Centre.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FJ013544%2F1

In the UK it ranks alongside other great National Collections including the British Library, The British Museum, The National Archives and Tate. The film collections are held across two world-leading facilities for the preservation, conservation and restoration of film; the BFI Master Film store in Warwickshire - a state-of-the-art, sub-zero facility where nitrate and acetate film collections are preserved - and The J Paul Getty Jr Conservation Centre in Hertfordshire.  In support of the continued range of film conservation activities undertaken at the Conservation Centre, on which research and access are based, this bid combines requests for the renewal and upgrading of equipment and systems across photographic and digital methods and technologies. Equipment within the following categories is being requested: Film cleaning Film processing High resolution digital imaging for restoration and preservation Digital cinema projection Digitisation equipment for research access files from film prints The bid represents an opportunity to bring coherent and strategically vital renewal, in a period when the expertise for photographic and digital reproduction technologies are finely balanced. Across the activities necessary to safely reproduce film for preservation, research and public viewing, the new equipment secures continuation of existing operations while simultaneously extending their currency and reach. It is the distinctive characteristic of film conservation that the historical understanding of original objects leads to their creative reproduction in contemporary materials, rather than their direct display or exhibition. There is a continual need, therefore, to ensure archive technologies are assessed in quite different terms from film post production.  The BFI's Heritage 2022 strategy promotes uniquely a fruitful combination of maintaining the unique characteristics of the film print medium in projection, through creation of 100 show prints of international film classics, along with the continuing curated digitisation of lesser-seen collection titles ripe for research. Both draw on the kind of equipment, and underlying skills, represented in this application, which would ensure continuation of this comprehensive approach. The project also provides timely support for inter-generational knowledge and skill transfer between conservators. Taken together, the equipment provides the fundamental and integrated basis on which film preservation can be undertaken now and in the future. It will underpin the deepening and sustained development of those techniques, as parallel generations of film conservators work alongside each other, transmitting and adapting them within a secure and inventive environment.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV012401%2F1

There were two major impacts associated with this project as funded, both in the education sector: the first was the development and initial promotion of the OCR A level option ""African Kingdoms, c. 1400-1800"", and the second the development of a new online textbook freely available to all Senior Secondary schoolchildren in English-speaking West Africa sitting the West African Senior Secondary School Examination (WASSCE) in History. This follow-on funding allows the development of a much fuller take-up of these projects than was initially envisaged in the impact funding for the first project. Regarding the WASSCE textbook, this funded the production of the text, the setting up of the website, and the launching of the textbook at the West African Education Council (WAEC) meeting in Banjul in March 2018. Regarding the OCR course it funded a summer school and website. However no teacher training in the WAEC countries delivering this resource was envisaged. Nevertheless, since the project was launched, it has become clear through dialogue with African partners that a full suite of teacher training programs is required for the project to be fully successful, and to reach the maximum number of users, and hence the need for this funded expansion of the original impact is necessary. This follow-on bid is now made with Dr Vincent Hiribarren as co-Investigator. Dr Hiribarren is a colleague of the PI's in the History department at King's College London. His participation as Co-Investigator derives from the heavy participation he has had in the project to date, since he designed the website, wrote two of the chapters, and attended both project meetings in Freetown and Banjul. As website designer, a historian of West Africa, well known to participants in the project from all 4 participant countries, and someone with extensive pedagogical experience at secondary and tertiary levels, he is an ideal participant in the teacher training aspects of the project. The impact of this follow-on funding will be extensive. The launching of these projects has enabled the PI to develop a much fuller suite of new connections and a framework to now ensure full take-up of these projects and training in their implementation, which will be secured by the follow-on funding. In the WASSCE case, the PI and Co-I will co-lead pedagogy workshops in each of the 4 countries which contributed to the development of the new resource, in collaboration with West African partners. These workshops will train teachers in the delivery of the textbook, in new pedagogical models, and in designing new course materials. In the OCR case, a new partnership with the Royal African Society's Education office will enable full connection with a range of schools not previously reached through the promotion related to this option. Both impacts will therefore be radically extended through the follow-on funding. The WASSCE impact will also significantly build towards the development of the Global Challenges Research Fund framework through developing new pedagogical resources and expertise in West Africa, while the OCR textbook helps to deliver on the recognised importance of expanding diversity of perspectives and histories taught in UK schools. Indeed it's to be noted in the latter case that this is something of growing importance to the Historical profession, following the launch of the Royal Historical Society's report on Race, Ethnicity and Equality in October 2018 (https://royalhistsoc.org/racereport/).","The follow-on funding's focus is a radically expanded impact developing from the initial leadership fellowship. This builds on the initial research component of the project, the PI's research on precolonial West African economic history, resulting in the monograph A Fistful of Shells: West Africa From the Rise of the Slave Trade to the Age of Revolution (Allen, Lane/Chicago University Press, 2019).  The research for this project involved extensive fieldwork in a number of West African countries. Through this fieldwork, and engagement with research collaborators in West Africa, the PI became aware of the urgent need to develop proper resources for both learners and teachers for the delivery of the History curriculum in West African schools. This saw the development of a revised Impact plan in the initial Leadership Fellowship, through the development of a dedicated website hosting a free ebook written by a number of collaborators based in and outside of West Africa (https://wasscehistorytextbook.com). The impact for this follow-on funding will see the radical expansion of the reach of this textbook through the following means: 1) Hosting of dedicated teacher-training workshops in each of the 4 West African Education Council (WAEC) countries (Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, The Gambia) which contributed to developing the ebook, where textbook authors and history professors will lead pedagogical training and develop new pedagogical resources for history teachers in these countries. This will thereby for the first time empowering teachers to both know better the resources available and the material for teaching, and thereby to enhance their students' knowledge. 2) The supplying of free flashdrives with the ebook, for distribution in each WAEC country, to ensure as wide access to this resource as possible. The flashdrives will be distributed with an eye to the population of each country, numbers as follows: 3000 for Nigeria, 1500 for Ghana, 500 each for Gambia and Sierra Leone. The flashdrives will be pre-loaded with the textbook, which activity will be paid for from administrative costs associated with the project. This WASSCE project in turn developed from the PI's existing work with the OCR Assessment board, as a member of the OCR History Consultative forum and lead consultant on the development of the OCR A level option ""African Kingdoms: c. 1400 - c. 1800"". The impact for the original Leadership Fellowship involved workshops for secondary school teachers on this option and a plenary lecture at the Schools' History Project conference. However the urgency of this impact has been redoubled subsequently following the Royal Historical Society's report on Ethnicity, Race and Equality, and the growing clamour for a more diverse representation in school curricula. With this in mind, the PI will radically expand the impact of this project through a new partnership with the Royal African Society (RAS)'s Education office. This will lead to: 1) New partnerships and workshops with partners identifed by RAS, including the Historical Association and the National Union of Teachers' Black Teachers Network 2) New workshops with an expanded mailing list of interested teachers established by the RAS, and also by the Pi and Co-I's host institution, King's College London's History department, which has launched recently a King's History teachers' network Beyond this, the impact of the initial research leading to the impact agenda will be developed further through the publication of the PI's monograph in the US by Chicago University Press and in the UK by Allen Lane. This has already seen a lengthy feature published in History Today (Feb 2019). The visit to the ASA meeting in Boston to promote the WASSCE project (November 2019) will be timed to coincide with publicity events for the monograph, with invitations received already from the Director of the Smithsonian Museum of African Art to discuss the book.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT001143%2F1

Yet historians and social scientists have focused on elections as the primary experience of politics, missing the ways in which petitioners initiated personal protests to councillors, parliamentarians, monarchs, and almost every other imaginable figure of authority.  The project brings together experts in the history of petitioning, in political studies of public engagement, and in twentieth-century British society to investigate petitioning as an activity and an institution. This enables the team to analyse the core challenge of mass democracy: how should direct, participatory, and representative democracy mix in a larger, more diverse political community? By identifying new meanings and contexts for the familiar, accessible practice of petitioning, we can assess changing social relations and political cultures beyond particular institutions or themes as a level of analysis. The project's broad chronology and interdisciplinary team permit investigation of the shift from paper to e-petitioning, enabling the first historical account of what might be gained and lost in transitions from analogue to digital politics.  This research will test how particular campaigners embraced - or rejected - petitions at particular points in their activities. For example, at the outset of our period we suspect that an older tradition of parliamentary petitioning was waning in favour of addresses to the monarch or the government. However, in the decades after the Second World War campaigners took the initiative outside of any formal systems inviting or receiving their petitions, forcing their own petition sheets upon elected representatives or responsible authorities. The project also identifies both the local mechanics of activism and the changing technologies behind it. By the end of our period, a paper-based Jubilee 2000 petition to G8 leaders circulated in churches and schools, just as NGOs and the Scottish Parliament experimented with early internet petitions. Moreover, petitions have often offered their organisers an easy way to harvest contact details and personal data on supporters for future mobilisation. The project will explore how this practice developed alongside the professionalisation of political parties and pressure groups, as well as how they evaded successive data protection laws. Doing so will clarify and query contemporary dilemmas about e-petitions by understanding our recent past. A multidisciplinary team is able to assess the trends, range, and meanings of petitioning in twentieth-century Britain by using archival records from individuals, voluntary groups, and the government, alongside existing and new interviews of campaigners and those receiving petitions. For the later decades of our period we can add quantitative social survey data and study the shift to digital activism, connecting the history of petitioning to contemporary research on e-petitioning. Findings will be shared with practitioners in the UK's legislatures, local government, and NGOs. Academic articles and a monograph will analyse the variety and contexts of petitioning through case studies of particular signatory groups (such as young people), particular causes (such as environmentalism), and particular encounters with petitioning (such as newspaper and television images of petitions being presented). By exploring a widespread form for political expression - petitioning - this project will reveal the dynamics of representation, voluntary association, and popular sovereignty over a century of reinvention and change in British citizenship.","Our research into the history of petitioning will improve the operation, exploitation, and development of petitioning systems in twenty-first-century Britain. It will also enhance debates over the extent to which petitioning is a form of 'slacktivism' or 'clicktivism', fabricating a sense of participation rather than offering an alternative or additional form of political engagement by active citizens. We are studying the transition from paper to digital petitioning as part of our research into twentieth-century society, but our work with non-academic beneficiaries will prompt further reflection on the role that petitioning does - or should - play in contemporary democracy. In particular, our work explores continuing dilemmas: When and how should elected representatives or responsible authorities react to the claims of petitioners rather than rely on their own judgement and mandate? Do petitioners expect to see their requests fulfilled and how do experiences of rejection or success shape their political activities in the future? How do campaigners use petitions to recruit supporters, elicit contact data on petition-signers, and otherwise benefit from signature lists beyond the stated aims of the petition?  The project engages the staff overseeing some major public petitions systems in the UK today, as well as campaigners using petitions as part of their work, and the wider public. With clerks from the House of Commons and staff from two NGOs on our advisory board, we can share our findings with practitioners during the project and ensure our impact activities are co-designed to address their experience and concerns. We will also offer impact workshops for staff working for the House of Commons, the Scottish Parliament, and the National Assembly for Wales, encouraging them to consider the varied historical aims, experiences, and outcomes of petitioning campaigns, as well as the way institutions and their staff have received their petitions. This will permit them to place their current and potential future practices in a long-run historical perspective with a particular awareness of the ways in which 'precedent' and practice have mutated in the context of mass democracy. We will offer a similar workshop for local government officers and campaigners as part of Huddersfield's annual #NotWestminster event on new approaches to local democracy. A parliamentary reception hosted by our project partner, the History of Parliament, will share our findings with MPs, their staff, and a public audience in the Palace of Westminster. We will also spread our findings with a wider audience. We have the chance to reach contemporary petition-signers through a series of 'petition of the month' articles for the House of Commons Petitions Committee's website. These will not only share case studies from our research but also disseminate our major conclusions relating to the role of local/national/international organisations, the grassroots agency of those signing petitions, the ways in which authorities and representatives receive them, and the extent to which people found petitions to be effective. A printed report, offered for online co-publication by the charity Hansard Society and the non-partisan campaign group Unlock Democracy, will disseminate our findings on how how petitioning has interacted with electoral democracy and how petitioning relates to other forms of active citizenship. The report will reveal the ways in which a transition from paper to electronic petitions has changed the function and meaning for those signing, organising, and receiving them. In particular, it will raise questions about the ways in which petitions, analogue and digital, have been an overlooked source for secondary use of personal data; even since the introduction of data laws in the 1980s, many of those signing petitions have not and do not realise they are consenting to this.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT003847%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will be the first thoroughgoing examination of dialogue in the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata, composed in Sanskrit - likely between 400 BCE and 400 CE - is a long, narrative poem that chronicles the history of the Indian people within the context of a divine struggle between good and evil. Throughout India's history, the Mahabharata has continued to be of central cultural and religious significance. In addition to shedding new light on the Mahabharata itself, the project will demonstrate the contemporary relevance of the text in relation to a number of current debates in philosophy, politics, ethics, and religion. We will analyze all the frame dialogues, all the main discussions and debates among the central characters, and the major dialogues embedded within the main story, while at the same time examining the relationship between different dialogues with each other. Examining structural features, intertextual relationships amongst dialogues in the text, and potential avenues for a meaningful engagement with interlocutors beyond the text, this project will be both a comprehensive and programmatic study of dialogue in the Mahabharata. We will conduct our analysis by focusing on four distinct, yet interconnected, types of dialogue in the Mahabharata:  (1) dilemmas and debates: we will analyze dialogues that address a conflict or dilemma. We will relate these dialogues to the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Dmitri Nikulin, with the following questions in mind: To what extent do dialogues in the Mahabharata offer a meaningful exploration of the nature of dialogue itself? What does the dialogical presentation of knowledge say about the nature of knowledge?  (2) dialogues with kings: we will analyze dialogues that feature a king. We will relate these dialogues to the work of Ashis Nandy, Amartya Sen, Rajeev Bhargava,and Charles Taylor, with these particular questions in mind: To what degree does the Mahabharata offer a precedent for Indian secularism? To what extent are the ethics of the king, as offered by the Mahabharata, compatible with more secular models of governance?  (3) dialogues with 'others': we will look at how dialogues construct social identities and negotiate the differences between such identities, whether those differences are defined along the lines of caste, race, religious tradition, or gender. We will relate these dialogues to the work of Martin Buber, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida with the following questions in mind: To what degree is an encounter with the other a starting point for ethical enquiry? To what degree does dialogue offer the possibility for growth or change through an encounter? To what degree do these dialogues provide an ethical framework for dealing with diversity and difference?  (4) dialogues with God: we will look at dialogues that feature a divine interlocutor, with a particular focus on Krishna. We will relate these dialogues to the work of John Hick, Rowan Williams, and Bhikku Parekh as we consider the following questions: To what extent does dialogue in the Mahabharata convey a religious pluralism? What are the theological justifications for including multiple religious views? Throughout the project we will approach the Mahabharata as a work that has retained its cognitive value and that can therefore make important contributions, interventions, and shifts in perspective to debates going on today. Similar to the way that scholars today still fruitfully draw upon the works of classical Greek and Roman thinkers when discussing contemporary issues related to philosophy, politics, ethics, and religion, we will engage with the Mahabharata as a living and relevant work with valuable insights into the human condition.","Impact is a core feature throughout the project, as one of the aims is to open up ways of engaging with the Mahabharata to explore its contemporary relevance. In terms of impact beyond academic communities, the project will work with teachers of RE throughout the UK to develop a teaching resource to supplement and enhance the teaching of Hinduism at AS and A levels. At the end of the project, we will host a teaching workshop at Lancaster University with a focus on the teaching of Asian religions. In addition to providing the occasion for launching the teaching resource, the workshop will stage a dialogue between university lecturers and professors of Asian religions, with AS and A level teachers of Asian religions. Through both the resource and the workshop, the project will make a positive and sustained contribution to the teaching of Asian traditions that prepares students for life in multicultural Britain.  The teaching resource will draw upon examples from the Mahabharata to teach topics on Hinduism from the AS level and A level syllabi. Based on years of using the Mahabharata as a way of illustrating Hindu ideas and practices to first year university students, the PI will work together with RE teachers to devise a teaching resource that draws on the approachability of the main story, the exhaustive range of ideas that are articulated within the text, and the complex, yet accessible ways in which conflicting doctrines are brought together. Because it is available through so many mediums - from retellings and translations, to two TV series, to a range of comic books and storybooks, as well as a number of films and novels through its allegorical representations - the Mahabharata offers a unique opportunity to capture the imagination of students unfamiliar with the Hindu tradition, as well as to continue to engage and to challenge those with some degree of background with Hinduism.  The teaching resource will be in the form of an electronic slideshow, like a Keynote or Power Point presentation. It will introduce the main story and its main characters, and provide a context for the Mahabharata in relation to Hinduism and to South Asian religious and cultural traditions more generally. It will contain links to translations, retellings, articles, and the Mahabharata podcast. It will also be beautifully designed, containing vivid depictions of the Mahabharata itself, images from a range of mediums within South Asian material cultures, as well as modern images to help set a number of issues and debates explored in the text within a modern context. The teaching resource will be aimed at year 11, 12 and 13 students and will be designed to be used by teachers and students throughout all three years. There are three main areas (out of four) of the A-level syllabus that the resource will address:  1) Belief and Sources of Authority: within this area, it will specifically address the following topics: religious pluralism; the four aims of life; concepts of karma and samsara; and the Bhagavad Gita. 2) Worship: within this area, it will address: various forms of worship. 3) Personal Deities and Family Relations: within this area, it will specifically address: the four stages of life; the caste system; diet; the means of attaining moksha; and rites of passage.  When addressing these topics, the resource will direct students to a variety of sources to examine a particular episode or group of episodes that in one way or another address the topic. It will not attempt to summarize or interpret such episodes for students, but rather encourage an engagement with these episodes by asking students to consider a number of questions. Through engaging stories, vivid characters, and vexing ethical dilemmas, the resource will help teachers explore many of the themes they already teach in concrete and creative ways.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM008827%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              How has the ownership of ideas - 'intellectual property', or IP, as it is now called - shaped the development of science, technology and society? A new, synthetic framework for investigating this vital question was one of the major outcomes of the Leeds-Bristol AHRC 'Owning and Disowning Invention' project. As one of the co-Is on that project, Prof. G. Radick took the lead in developing the framework and also in extending it to reinterpreting historical shifts in the science and practice of plant breeding in Britain in the decades around 1900. It is the aim of this Follow-on Funding project to bring the insights of this research to audiences well placed to benefit from them, in a form that maximises both uptake and utility. At the core of the synthetic framework is a new distinction between IP claims narrowly construed - the familiar legal instruments of patents, trademarks and so on ('IP-narrow') - and other, broader sorts of ownership claims ('IP-broad'), notably claims to have discovered something first ('priority claims') and, on behalf of a discipline, claims that its theoretical principles explain the success of useful techniques and technologies ('productivity claims'). This recognition of intersecting, interacting narrow and broad concepts of IP - and also the potentially destructive tensions they engender - serves to illuminate a range of issues, from the troublesome classification of scientific work as 'pure' or 'applied' to the nature of the public authority of the sciences in our culture. In his own use of this expanded conception of IP in the technosciences, Radick has suggested that, far more than historians have suspected hitherto, the new Mendelian genetics of the early twentieth century depended on the carefully controlled management of the distribution and reputation of putatively Mendelian, and putatively excellent (but in fact highly problematic) plant varieties. This Follow-on project will work in collaboration with the Newbury-based Organic Research Centre (ORC) to create public-facing resources on four specific themes: i) changes in the biological understanding of heredity have coevolved with changes in the economic conditions and marketing of plant varieties. The Owning and Disowning Invention project has opened a rich body of evidence for the further exploration of these problems, which can be used throughout the collaboration with the ORC. ii) the patent regimes under which scientists in different countries operate is related to the likelihood of their producing successful innovations. Currently, the IP system operating across Europe and North America favours some plant breeding methods over others. Attention to the long-run history of IP and plant breeding can stimulate critical thinking about this status quo. iii) typically, in the context of plant breeding in particular and the biosciences in general, IP has been understood as only relating to patents. The differences between mainstream plant breeding methods deriving from the prestige science of molecular biology and alternative methods not so derived presents an ideal setting for analysis making use of the expanded conception of IP in order, again, to promote critical thinking and more creative discussion. iv) the history of plant breeding has been marked by a persistent shift in the location of breeding work, away from the farm and towards the trialling fields of private companies. Understanding these developments requires a focus upon our changed understanding of what plant breeding innovation looks like, and how it might be fostered and protected. This proposed project is modelled closely on a recently funded, Leeds-based AHRC Follow-on Funding project, 'Innovating in Combat: Telecommunications and Intellectual Property in the First World War', partnered with the Museum of the History of Science at the University of Oxford, and led by Prof. G. Gooday, who was PI on the Owning and Disowning Invention project, and Co-I here.","There are seven principal beneficiaries: State-funded pre-breeding centres Organisations funded by government, often with a non-profit status, must nevertheless work within an industry in which the protection of organic innovation is the norm. Indeed, for some, the implementing of intellectual property (IP) legislation is a central component of their research output. The conference and materials produced by this Follow-on Funding project will benefit them by providing a new perspective on the role of IP in their scientific research, offering insights into the long history of state-funded biological research and the ownership of invention. Private plant breeders Of all the groups concerned with IP in the biosciences, this group is the most beleaguered. For some time, its members have relied upon a legislative and legalistic defence of their market activities. They will benefit from the opportunity to engage with a wider academic community. The materials made available on the conference website will provide a sound and accessible introduction to the modes of argument and reasoning that exist across the disciplines discussed above, enabling improved articulation of better formulated policies to an increasingly sceptical public. Undergraduate and incoming A-level students They will benefit from being able to approach the topics they study from a broader perspective, rather than seeing history and biology as two unrelated ventures. At the same time, they will be given a valuable opportunity to tackle the issues of global poverty and population growth which are set to become particularly acute over the next fifty years. Archives relating to the history of IP in the biosciences Some of the most important history-of-biology archives in the UK have yet to have their holdings investigated from the expanded IP perspective. Scientific centres such as the John Innes Centre, the National Institute of Agricultural Botany, and Rothamsted Research, alongside significant university historical collections (particularly those of the longest-standing agricultural science departments, in the University of Cambridge, the University of Leeds and the University of Reading) can benefit from their archives attracting greater attention and being more fully exploited.  Policy makers concerned with innovation and IP Organisations such as the Intellectual Property Office and other governmental agencies will benefit from being able to construct their current and future policies from a more historically and sociologically informed perspective. As yet there have been few direct efforts to establish pathways to impact between IP researchers and policy makers. This project, concentrating on both the history of innovation and of IP, will create materials of value to large sections of the public policy community. Agroecological crop breeding advocates At present these groups have tended to base their arguments on grounds to do with the ethical implications of contemporary industrial practices. This conference will offer them new ways in which to make their case, ones focused much more on the historical development of the changes that have generated anxiety. Emphasising the diversity present in populations over which it is difficult to exercise IP rights can offer a new means of helping these advocates, and the growers they represent, meet their goals. International agricultural development agencies and NGOs The granting of IP rights over organic innovations has been one of the most controversial aspects of much of the work conducted in the developing world. Organisations dedicated to the expansion of the agricultural industries in this country will benefit from access to some of the most recent academic research results concerned with the development and consequences of this legislation. Exposing and discussing the problems posed by IP should help improve the effectiveness of these organisations activities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL009455%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will form a new network to examine the role of clothing fashions as a powerful and pervasive cultural intermediary between Britain, Japan, China and Korea. Fashion crosses and confounds geographical boundaries in a myriad of ways, and yet notions of Britishness, Chineseness and Japaneseness remain central to the dynamics of fashionable dress as cultural expression. This year, Tokyo Fashion Week hosted the first Japanese Tweed Run, a bicycling event that celebrates nostalgic notions of British eccentricity through the motif of traditional tweed. Meanwhile, in Britain, the prime-time television drama Doctor Who has drawn harsh criticism for dressing its hero in an acrylic-mix fake Harris tweed jacket manufactured in China. Fashion design often uses the 'exotic' as a reliable source of novelty and luxury, but an item of fashionable clothing can be designed in one hemisphere, manufactured in another, and retailed globally while maintaining a brand identity attached to nation. British high-street chain Marks and Spencer and the Japanese label Uniqlo have multiple stores in China. Both of these brands have also recently been joined on London's Oxford Street by Chinese store Bosideng who are set to create the first tangible presence of Chinese high street fashion in Britain. In China, the influence of Korean fashion is also increasing and threatens to displace the position of Japan as a style leader in some fashion sectors. Internet shopping and fashion blogging further calls into question the significance of national borders, while promoting highly distinct European and East Asian identities. The last decade has also seen a sea change in fashion studies. Western forms of fashion within non-western contexts are being reconsidered to produce new readings of fashion as a far less geographically contingent vehicle for individuality, cosmopolitanism, ethnicity, and global networks of money, goods and ideas. East Asian fashion is recognised as 'speaking' to British consumers as European fashion has 'spoken' to East Asia. The network that we are proposing draws on UK and internationally based academics, artists, museum curators and fashion industry professionals who will work together to produce a new understanding of transnational fashion exchange as an agent of cultural translation.  In three themed workshops, the network will forge new relations between fashion academics, fashion professionals, artists and museum collection managers, in creative interdisciplinary dialogues that connect concepts of fashion, brand identity and actual fashion garments. The critical focus and network membership across the national boundaries of Britain, Japan, China and Korea will increase understanding of fashion translations from non-UK perspectives and create long-lasting knowledge exchanges at an international level, with gains for industry and commerce as well as fashion studies. The benefits will include knowledge and skills exchange across disciplinary and national boundaries to improve understanding and rejuvenate the conceptualisation and practice of fashion across the international academic community, third sector and private sector. We will further develop and disseminate new directions in fashion studies by authoring a special issue of a leading peer-reviewed journal and will develop a website that makes our activities and findings accessible to students, the fashion industry and the wider public. We will also lay the foundations for a substantial larger project. Our reference points of Britain, Japan, China and Korea will serve as starting points from which to set a future research agenda on global transnational fashion exchange.","This network will benefit the third sector (fashion museums and institutions), the commercial private sector (fashion industry), and the wider public. Its effects will increase understanding across national, cultural and disciplinary boundaries, counter cultural stereotypes of East and West, enhance the creative and cultural economy, and augment business opportunity. Dynamic workshop exchanges between academics, museum and fashion professionals will maximise the communication of skill sets and knowledge, and showcase the unique resources of particular stakeholders within the network. For example, increased knowledge of the holdings of fashion collections contributes to the scope of future research and provides an invaluable resource for artists and the fashion industry. Critical academics engagements with cross-cultural fashion exchange increases understanding of cultural dynamics and social responsibility within the fashion industry and fashion business, while industry practitioners expose academic and museum practitioners to economic and merchandising factors that are crucial in understanding fashion today. Artists and designers pose challenging questions and provide provocative responses to issues of fashion and cultural identity. Academics also provide detailed historical contexts and theoretical frameworks for fashion which museum professionals can use to better situate their collections. Fashion collection specialists will form an important part of this transnational network. Curators whose research and collections are informed by cultural exchange between East Asia and Britain and within East Asia have already agreed to be network participants and speakers. These include: Tamami Suoh and Akiko Fukai (Kyoto Costume Institute), Anna Jackson and Pauline Lemoigne (Victoria and Albert Museum) and Alexandra Palmer (Royal Ontario Museum). The work of these curators informs the display and interpretation of fashion in important public museums, contributing to increased public awareness of inter-cultural issues in fashion. Curators also shape the collecting policies of these key institutions, with regard to contemporary East Asian fashion and inter-cultural exchange in fashion garments. This embeds the social impact of the network's thematic focus still further, supports future study in this area for fashion designers, and increases future opportunities for public exhibitions. The industry-based members of our network will also extend our impact into the private sector. The 2012 Autumn/Winter collection of Dries van Noten is a recent high profile haute couture example of how fashion designers use museum textile collections to innovate. Van Noten's study of Chinese, Japanese and Korean garments at the Victoria and Albert Museum fed directly into the production of a new collection that has had wide fashion and popular media coverage. Commitments to our network have already received from: Ted Young-Ing, former Senior Designer at Gucci and art director and founder of the Tweed Run that exploits Britishness with cultural and fashion events in Japan and Britain; Christine Tsui, a fashion merchandiser in mainland China, who is researching contemporary Chinese fashion and seeks to set up an archive of East Asian fashion designers for the use of academic and industry researchers; and Pernille Rudlin who, as European representative for Japan Intercultural Consulting, works with Japanese fashion companies such as ASICS and Uniqlo to facilitate European/East Asian business interactions though greater inter-cultural understanding. Workshop speakers such as these, and other fashion industry professionals who have registered their interest in participation in our network, will provide another means by which the network's activities will enhance the research capacity, knowledge and skills of businesses, and contribute towards wealth creation as well as public awareness and understanding of the societal issues of cultural exchange.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK008315%2F1

The two groups will explore the converging and diverging ways in which they experience the climate crisis and allow them to share their views and perspectives to create a global conversation drawing on their local perspectives. Young people in Uganda will participate in workshops led by Rafiki Theatre - a leading applied theatre organisation which has been delivering community arts projects since 2010. Young people in the UK will work with Highly Sprung - a leading physical theatre company based in Coventry making work for and with young people. The PI and Becky Warnock, a freelance socially-engaged artist, will also be involved in the UK sessions as co-facilitators while also overseeing the project and bringing together the work of both groups.  Both groups will participate in 7 workshops which will result in a highly visual, engaging digital 'call to action' which will be hosted online. The call to action will utilise performance, film, creative writing and photography and will be shared with wider audiences including other young people as well as institutions including universities and non-governmental organisations. It will draw on their specific experiences and learning throughout the creative process, exploring their concerns and the action they want to see take place, locally and globally. Throughout, responses will be shared digitally to encourage dialogue between the groups. This innovative project will, therefore, frame young people as co-creators of knowledge and art and connect them globally, leading to a joint exploration of the local and global ways in which the climate crisis impacts them.  Young people will participate in the following activities: Workshop schedule 1 - Introduction: Sharing initial views on climate crisis. First global check-in 2 - Exploring local impacts of climate change on communities: Participatory photography workshop including community mapping. Can include water pollution, understandings of food production, our use of transport  3 - Sharing the local, globally: Utilising the responses from the previous workshop, groups will share and respond to each other's creative work using these to begin creating performance, creative writing, etc. Second global check-in 4 - Devise/create: Continuing the work from the previous session, devising creative work including performance, creative writing, film 5 - Devise/create/share: Some of the work in development will be shared during our third global check-in. Young people will reflect on each other's work, identifying similarities and differences and thinking through how this may shape their own creative responses 6 - Devise/create/finalise: These final sessions will be used to finalise young people's work  7 - Devise/create/finalise: As above Post workshops - Curation and editing of the artwork, creation of the online call to action, and a sharing with the groups of young people (primarily led by Becky Warnock). 'With One Breath' draws upon and extends Smith and Turner-King's research and practice on artistic approaches to exploring the climate crisis with young people. Projects have included a co-devised piece with young people in Hong Kong ( Smith 2010) exploring pollution, the creation of a digital resource for young people (Smith and Turner-King 2020) and eco-pedagogy and storytelling (Turner-King 2019). Turner-King and Smith are collaborating in a global project 'Global Youth Citizen-Artists and their Publics: performing for Socio-ecological Justice' led by researchers at the University of Toronto. The project will also engage with Prof Emeritus Mond's expertise, which brings together mathematics and sustainable development to explore the climate crisis. In addition, it will extend Smith's wider research exploring art-based collaboration between the global North and South for social change.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW004801%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Languages are currently valued mainly as practical tools for basic transactions in monoglot contexts. Yet language use is a creative act. Languages evolve in interaction with the needs of individuals who acquire and shape their linguistic resources in interaction with multiple intersecting communities. They change and mingle as cultural constellations shift, and they rapidly turn new technical possibilities into communicative innovations.  The crisis of Modern Foreign Languages in UK schools, with its serious consequences for higher education, business, and diplomacy, has its roots in globalisation, the expansion of English as global lingua franca, and diversifying electronic media dominated by English. Arguably it also marks the failure of UK policy-makers and the educational sectors to address these challenges with the necessary understanding, imagination, and unity of purpose.  This programme exploits the crisis as an opportunity to engage stakeholders in a collaborative process of rethinking the identity of Modern Languages from the ground up. It will seek to dismantle assumed oppositions between 'vocational' and 'academic' purposes, and develop a concept of languages that responds to the multi-faceted needs of individuals and communities in the contemporary world. Researchers from Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, Reading, SOAS (London), and Pittsburgh will pool their expertise in some 40 languages to unlock the subject's creative and connective potential by investigating how languages and creativity interact in processes involving more than one language.  Research in seven interlocking strands will analyse how we turn thoughts into language-specific metaphors (strand 1), deploy the resources offered by our language to name the elements of our environment (strand 2), and negotiate language 'barriers' to intelligibility across related languages (strand 3). They will seek to capture the creative stimulus generated by multilingual theatre and music (strand 4), identify the creative processes initiated by multilingual literature (strand 5), and explore the creation of multiple meanings in the act of translation (strand 6). Empirical research will compare functional and creative methodologies in language learning and establish benefits of creative activities for the literacy, motivation, and confidence that are key factors in take-up and progression (strand 7).  In order to understand multilingual creativity, we need to engage with a variety of contexts and exchange knowledge with practitioners. Partners from beyond academia will contribute to focus groups, workshops, conferences and specialised projects. To take just a few examples, the British Council will enhance opportunities for engagement with policy-makers and involve learners across the world. Work on community languages within the UK will be augmented by a window onto linguistic communities across over 120 countries opened up by BirdLife International. Collaboration with Sputnik Theatre Company, Punch Records, the Ashmolean Museum and cultural festivals will facilitate cross-language projects with actors and musicians, an exhibition, a 'Linguamania' celebration and a Multilingual Music Fest for primary school children. English PEN will provide opportunities to find out about multilingual experiments by creative writers. Meanwhile language experts from GCHQ and ING Media will give insights into the creative language skills used in intelligence and PR. Teachers and learners in schools will interact with the research throughout, culminating in an interactive schools Roadshow.  The programme will transform research in Modern Languages by invigorating the subject from the grass-roots up to blue-sky research. By putting creativity at the heart of languages, it will reconnect languages with the arts and humanities while allowing their innovative force to become productive across disciplines and communities.","The programme will take advantage of OWRI as a unique opportunity to achieve a transformational impact on Modern Languages research in the UK. It will do so by breathing new life into a subject that has lost confidence in its identity as languages have come to be associated in schools and society with vocational skills devoid of intellectual excitement.  The programme is predicated on a passionate conviction that languages have creativity built into them, and that this principle holds the key to achieving the urgently needed transformation - both because it motivates engagement, and because it brings innovative thinking to bear on securing the future of the subject.  The researchers will implement a communications strategy centred on the main website and associated social media, with a wide range of impact-oriented activities. Knowledge exchange with partners will gain depth and resonance in annual conferences and related activities on four themes, with different strands taking responsibility for conceptual coordination:  Year 1: Languages & Creativity (lead: strands 1 and 7) Year 2: Creating Multilingual Identities (lead: strands 2 and 3)  Year 3: Performing Languages (lead: strand 4) Year 4: Global - Local: Creating a Multilingual World (lead: strands 5 and 6) A Public Media Focus Group and a Focus Group for Digital & Social Media, Apps & Games will keep the programme in touch with modes and channels of communication. A Schools Focus Group and Careers Focus Group will involve sixth-formers and students to ensure that the programme speaks to the constituencies which are vital to its transformative success. Focus Group Workshops will involve a wider range of partners and participants. The Steering Committee will oversee monitoring of the impact work through school surveys, and written, oral and digital feedback.  The activities of the programme will put creativity at the Heart of Modern Languages in a cumulative process that both engages and benefits the intended audiences: policy-makers, communities whose first language is not English, the creative economy, other organisations that use languages professionally, teachers and learners. Policy work led by strand 1 (Kohl) in collaboration with the British Council will promote dialogue across stakeholder groups to embed creativity in policy documentation on language use and language learning. This will gain an international dimension in two workshops with Pittsburgh and the US languages association JNCL-NCLIS. Work on UK community languages will be led by strands 2 (Gosler, Park) and 3 (Maiden, Lahiri) in collaboration with the Smithsonian, BirdLife International and local and international schools, with activities ranging from crowd-sourcing projects to a primary school Multilingual Music Fest.  The creative economy gives immediate access to the creative potential of languages. Strand 4 (Dudrah, Bullock, Curtis) will involve actors and musicians in workshops, study days, and performances that give participants tasters of Russian theatre, Lieder, and Black British and British Asian music. The case for the social value of languages also needs to be made in the context of other forms of work with languages. Focus Workshops facilitated by Business in the Community will complement workshops that encourage young people to explore careers from unusual angles as creative writing and literary translation are put into contact with intelligence work and PR. Strands 5 (Ouyang, Hiddleston) and 6 (Reynolds, S. Park) will take the lead together with PI Katrin Kohl, who has extensive experience of languages in business contexts.  Engagement with schools led by strand 7 (Graham, Fisher) and supported by collaboration with the Association for Language Learning will be central to the research and impact work throughout, and empirical research will use schools as research sites. A global classroom project and Multilingual Olympiad will push language learning beyond the curriculum.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN004701%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              There is a broad consensus among linguists and cognitive scientists that human language involves a ""combinatorial system"" that determines how words can be combined to form grammatical structures, and a ""semantic system"" that interprets such grammatical structures. However, there is no consensus on the precise relationship between these two systems. In particular, it is still unclear whether the combinatorial and the semantic system operate completely independently, or whether certain combinatorial patterns are in fact meaning-driven. To address this question, ""clause-embedding predicates"" such as ""think"" and ""wonder"" provide an important test case. These predicates vary in the types of complements they can combine with. For instance, ""think"" only combines with declarative clauses (e.g., ""that Jo left"") while ""wonder"" only combines with interrogative clauses (e.g., ""who left""). Also, only some of them can combine with a noun phrase (e.g. ""believe the rumour"" is grammatical but ""think the rumour"" is not). In languages like Spanish, they furthermore vary with respect to the grammatical mood of their complements (indicative or subjunctive). There is preliminary evidence for a systematic link between such combinatorial patterns and the fine-grained semantic properties of these predicates. For example, predicates expressing an unfulfilled desire (e.g. ""hope"", ""wish"") never combine with interrogative clauses (e.g. ""Jo hopes who left"" is ungrammatical). However, the lack of a systematic investigation of such connections across multiple languages, and of a unified theoretical framework, have so far prevented a thorough understanding of such potential meaning-driven combinatorial restrictions. This project will pursue an integrated approach to investigate the relation and interaction between the combinatorial and the semantic system in the area of clause-embedding, by combining multi-lingual data-collection and psycho-linguistic experiments with the development of unified theoretical analyses. It will make use of recent developments in the field: novel semantic theories that make it possible to articulate very precise hypotheses about the relationship between meaning and combinatorial restrictions, and novel psycho-linguistic methods that deliver fine-grained data to evaluate such hypotheses. Concretely, the project will 1) collect data from 14 languages around the world on the combinatorial and semantic properties of clause-embedding predicates, 2) develop sophisticated theoretical hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying potential meaning-driven combinatorial patterns in clausal embedding, and 3) quantitatively evaluate these hypotheses based on psycho-linguistic experiments. The results will shed new light on the fundamental question of how the combinatorial and the semantic system operate together in the human language faculty. The resulting data will be made publicly available to serve further research and computational applications.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV002716%2F1

While humans are relatively good at recognising familiar, or at least predictable voices, identifying unfamiliar voices is much more difficult. This is often the task in forensic and investigative contexts. In such cases, a comparison is made of the voices of an unknown criminal and a known suspect, with the ultimate aim of assessing the likelihood that they belong to the same individual. Increasingly, around the world, speaker recognition machines (i.e. pieces of software) are used for these purposes. However, a critical question remains unanswered: do machines recognise speakers in the way that humans do? This question has received relatively little attention in the literature. The studies that have examined this issue are all small scale and simply compare the results of human recognition with those of machine recognition using overall error rates. However, what is much more important is understanding the contexts in which one method might outperform the other, and whether there is any benefit in combining the approaches. In addressing these issues, our research will provide a better understanding of how speaker recognition machines work and how they might be improved. Further, previous work has overlooked the many factors that may affect human recognition performance, such as cognitive bias. In this project, we assess the variability in human judgements as a function of different amounts of contextual information, especially in the context of a criminal trial where there may be other information pertinent to the case or even a forensic expert providing voice evidence which could influence the decision-making process involved in the speaker recognition task. In order to compare and combine human and machine responses, we will develop a bespoke computer game that elicits human judgements that are conceptually equivalent to those produced by the machine. In doing so, we will also test the viability of using the voice as the central element in a computer game; an area of computer game development that has received relatively little attention. The project has a number of specific research questions: 1. How do humans and machines perform at speaker recognition relative to each other, and can we improve performance by combining the two approaches? To what extent, therefore, do these methods capture the same information? 2. In what contexts (using speakers with different regional accents and diverse speech samples with varying durations and recording quality) do humans outperform machines? 3. How do different listener groups perform in speaker comparison tasks? Does familiarity with the regional accent improve performance?  4. To what extent are human judgements affected by contextual information that may occur in a forensic case, such as (i) the knowledge that it is a criminal case, (ii) other evidence from the case, or (iii) a forensic expert's opinion?","The proposed research is strongly applied in nature. The research questions stem from real world issues relating to speaker recognition, particularly in forensic contexts. Thus, our results will be of benefit to a range of non-academic users: (1) Judicial contexts The primary beneficiaries of our research will be forensic phoneticians who conduct speaker recognition for the purposes of casework. The results will allow experts to assess the conditions under which automatic systems may perform better or worse, and help experts to explain what such systems are actually doing, in order for courts to make more informed decisions about the evidence. Our results can also be used by experts to make delivery of their expert opinion to courts more accessible in cases involving earwitnesses. We will be able to disseminate our results to practising forensic phoneticians at J P French Associates (the UK's largest and longest established forensic speech and audio laboratory), given their long-standing relationship with our University Department. We will also share our results at the International Association of Forensic Phonetics and Acoustics (IAFPA) conference. IAFPA is the world's only association for forensic phonetics, and the conference attracts a large non-academic audience from private and governmental laboratories, security and law enforcement agencies, and police forces. Since our research will provide insights into the errors made by speaker recognition systems, the results will be of value to commercial developers of speaker recognition systems, principally for helping to improve the performance of such systems in the future. As part of the project, we will discuss our results with Nuance Communications (the largest commercial supplier of speaker recognition technology in the world and the producer of the system we use in this project). Detailed results of the comparison of the effects on decision-making of verbal vs numerical expert witness statements will be directed specifically to beneficiaries in the legal domain. Our results will be discussed with relevant end users in order that the courts are made aware of the potential effect of the wording of expert witness statement on jurors.  (2) Game designers A central part of this project is to develop a game that has voice as its central component. The voice is an under-utilised modality for computer games and so our project acts as a test of the viability of including voice elements more centrally into games. We will present the findings of our research to the co-director of 'Betajester' (Adam Boyne), a commercial company that develops immersive and interactive digital experiences with a focus on game development. We will also discuss the potential for developing our game for projects in the future. (3) Teaching and schools The task of speaker recognition is familiar to the general public through TV shows and films. Its real world applications also make it a fascinating topic for students. We intend to further maximise the impact of this project by engaging with school teachers and students in various ways. We will include a session on the topic of speaker recognition (using findings from the project) as part of a CPD course aimed at A-level English Language teachers. Such courses have run previously at York, and Llamas has been centrally involved in their development. We will also contact schools directly to offer talks about our project for students. Finally, we will offer our findings as a case study for the York English Language Toolkit site; this site provides resources on current research from the Department for teachers and students of A-level English Language.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT012978%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Interacting with computer-based maps has made many tasks, such as navigating from one place to another, significantly simpler for many users. The technology behind these developments, however, depends on being able to pin-point roads, buildings, paths, and other features in a precise way. The space of the world people move around in day by day is not the only kind of space which it is important to represent on computers. For example, historical documents can describe where buildings were, or where events happened. Writings about journeys made in the past, can help us today understand our own environment and how it was shaped and is still being shaped by the ways it has been perceived and described. Narratives of journeys are significant too in imagined worlds whether created in literature, or through media such as film. Studying such journeys, as well as other kinds of imagined spaces in literature, also helps us understand the ways in which people tell stories as a way of communicating with each other. The digital humanities includes the study of history, literature, and many other aspects of human experience, through digital technology. Ths technology may be used to process large amounts of information, which might come from historical documents or literary texts for example. This enables scholars to find patterns in the information, through techniques including visualisation of the data. These patterns can generate new questions or new perspectives on the world from which the data came. The digital humanities has successfully used Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for the study of data using computer-based maps. However, what can be done if all that we know is that the church is next to the house, or that the path went through the forest, or that the flood covered most of the town? These examples all include qualitative spatial relations: 'next to', 'through', 'covered most of'. These kinds of relations have been studied in computer science because, although they do not give enough information by themselves to plot things on a map, they can be represented computationally using logic. One motivation for the study of Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) in computer science is that humans often don't use very detailed spatial information. We might say ''move the chair next to the window'' instead of having to calculate the exact distances and angles involved. This kind of flexibility when dealing with locations is very similar to the need in the digital humanities to handle events, objects, journeys, and so on that cannot be pin-pointed on a map.  Thus, the digital humanities needs more flexible computer-based ways of representing spatial information, and computer science has extensive research on QSR. These two areas of study have had almost no interaction before now. This network brings together experts from the humanities in areas including history, literature, and archaeology, with experts from computer science in areas including artificial intelligence and geographical information systems. The network will focus on how the digital humanities can use adaptations of the ways qualitative spatial relations are used in computer science. Two workshops will explore detailed case studies based on documents and other resources from the participants' areas of expertise. A third workshop will encourage the formation of a cross-disciplinary community centred on spatial information in the digital humanities. This workshop will report on the case study explorations. It will also allow researchers, and organisations who make archives and other historical records accessible to the public, to plan together the work needed to build digital tools that will help people handle spatial information in the humanities which is qualitative, metaphorical, vague, uncertain or ambiguous .","The main area for potential impact lies with organisations which make archive data and museum collections available to the general public as well as to academic researchers. Archive data can include references to places and locations which are vague or imprecise. This makes linking different documents relating to the same place challenging and also can make it difficult for users, especially the public, to find documents relevant to them. Beyond merely locating sources, the ability to enrich records of historic buildings, landscapes, or places with digital representations of personal narratives is one way that techniques for qualitative spatial representation are likely to have an impact on individuals and community groups interacting with information about localities of significance to them. The project has four specific partner organisations who will all participate in some of the activities of the network including the concluding Outreach Workshop, which will also be open to representatives from other organisations working in related areas. Three of our partner organisations are; The National Archives, Historic England, and Leeds Museums and Galleries. The impact of the network for these organisations will initially be in introducing an awareness of techniques for dealing with qualitative spatial information. Access to expertise in computational representation of qualitative space. Beyond the lifetime of the network, this is expected to lead in the longer term to specific systems that will allow individuals improved ways of accessing vaguely located qualitative information. The impact of the understanding of spatial information can extend beyond the digital humanities. Our fourth partner organisation, is the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which sees potential impact in its need to understand spatial information present in sources such as text messages, phone conversations, emails, and other written and spoken means of communication. The relevance of the network here lies in the likelihood that qualitative spatial constructions appearing in historical narratives will, although culturally dependent, relate partly to ways that humans move and experience their environment. The involvement of DSTL could also help contribute to impact for the other organisations through providing a view of issues in a scientific context and bringing an awareness of a wider range of spatial information technologies.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR006482%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Institutions of Literature network will consider the hitherto neglected roles played by institutions in the development of literary culture during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. One of the most significant factors that marks this period as a crucial phase in the evolution of modern societal practices and ideologies is the progressive transfer of authority and fealties previously invested in individuals to organised societies and state bureaucracies. The profound impact of these developments on many different aspects of literature has not yet been granted due attention. Our network will address this lack. In most common conceptions of the ways that literature functions, the author and the reader are dominant: one seen as the originator of the literary work, the other as its auditor and arbiter. However, individuals are not the only stakeholders in the creation and reception of texts. Since the early eighteenth century, institutions have played integral roles in literary culture: teaching people how to value writing; providing sites for discussion and networks for circulation; serving as archival repositories; raising and disbursing money; distributing laurels and condemnations; and authoring works and conducting readings. In addition to this immense - yet largely uncharted - historical significance, one of the most compelling motives for studying these institutions is their continuing relevance to modern society. The practices of the schools, universities, libraries, museums and organisations which mediate literature today were developed within the institutional cultures which coalesced in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By studying the emergence of these practices, we can better understand our modern situations, appreciate the complexity of the lives of our ancestors and divine better courses for effectively employing institutional settings in the future. The network will focus on three major functions of institutions which had far-reaching consequences for literary production: their roles as networks, as curators and as active agents. In three two-day workshops held in York, Birmingham and London, as well as in a series of online discussions, the network will explore the histories of individual institutions and develop a framework for thinking about the sets of social and cultural conventions through which the roles of literary institutions have become defined. As well as inviting international and interdisciplinary scholars whose existing interests will feed productively into the workshops, we will begin the project with a widely-disseminated open call for participants in order to give all those interested in the work we propose to do the chance to join us. Recognising the ongoing implications of the historical practices we plan to examine, we will actively solicit the participation of institutions' current curators, administrators and librarians in all our discussions, seeking to draw on their experience of operating practices and configuring histories. Each of the workshops will feature a combination of panels of academic papers, roundtables and discussion sessions. The latter will allow our participants the opportunity to explore the larger issues surrounding institutional influence collaboratively. After each workshop, we will publish reports of our discussions and will continue them via email and via a project website on which blog posts, recordings and position papers will be published openly for consideration and comment. At the conclusion of the project, we will put together a collaboratively-edited collection drawing together the work presented and ideas developed through the network. This collection will provide an enduring record for academic and institutional communities, serving as a jumping-off point for further scholarship from our participants and those inspired by their ideas and as a point of pragmatic reference for stakeholders in modern institutions.","One of the Institutions of Literature network's primary goals is to identify broad principles that will help to guide both students of institutional history and those currently working in institutions. This breadth of vision will be one of the network's most significant attributes, allowing us to bring together people whose work often focuses on specific moments in particular histories in order to consider larger patterns and formulations, both intellectual and practical. Literature and culture are increasingly fostered in and mediated by institutions, which award prizes, set curricula, determine funding conditions, employ people and provide and require services. Studying the processes by which this situation came to be is of wider social interest for all those working in modern institutional environments. In looking at the ways that institutions came to be organised, we will draw out the implications for contemporary public and institutional policies and for locating creativity within our society. Understanding institutional histories can reveal the foundations and original purposes of the practices which have come to comprise considerable parts of everyday working life. The network will critically examine the development of processes like minute-taking, meeting, reporting, electing officers and negotiating within committees. Considering the histories of these practices will allow us to assess whether certain practices have evolved for contingent or outdated reasons and whether they might fruitfully be reconsidered in the light of social changes and new technologies.  The Institutions of Literature network will reach out beyond the academy through the direct participation of curators and stakeholders working at modern literary institutions, including libraries, learned societies and museums (details of participants who have already agreed to be involved are given in the Case for Support and the Pathways to Impact statement) By bringing acedemics and institutional stakeholders together, the network will ensure that the resulting scholarship is informed by the needs of both: academically rigorous, but engaged with the practical experience of institutional work and transmitted in manners that are open both in terms of minimising barriers to entry and avoiding unnecessarily specialised language. The previous paragraph draws a distinction for the purposes of explaining the network's ambitions, but this distinction is in many ways an unhelpful one. Academics are, after all, institutional professionals, with modern universities being institutions of literature the practices of which are fundamentally grounded in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century foundations. Conversely, many curators and institutional stakeholders have wide-ranging and impressive backgrounds in the humanities and social sciences. We intend to investigate whether the commonly perceived differences between scholars and other cultural practitioners are products of the very processes of professionalisation and institutionalisation that the network will examine. Considerations of the benefits and limitations of such specialisation will comprise a major aspect of our discussions and will provide our participants and those our work reaches through the means discussed in the Pathways to Impact statement with new and informed ways of reflecting on our present modes of operation.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN008790%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Ours is an age when images proliferate at unprecedented speed thanks to digital technology. So it is ironic that our past visual culture is seriously threatened by the very same technical advances. Many verbal texts are now stored and delivered by machine, and digital search techniques help us understand the meaning, provenance and reception of these texts. However, for reasons of economy or of complex IPR issues, the illustrations in these texts are frequently omitted. When included, they are often of low quality and without the metadata which are needed for understanding them. While their market value hardly suffers because of these shortcomings, their use as sources of aesthetic, literary and historical information is seriously compromised. There is a risk that tomorrow's readers will be almost unaware of illustration, even though research has shown that illustrated texts have qualities, meanings and strategies which are very different from those of texts that are not illustrated, and even strikingly different from those of the same verbal texts stripped of their images. Whole genres of artistic, educational and informative products may effectively be lost to us. A unique opportunity to start addressing this issue is provided by a dataset held by the British Library. This dataset consists of 68,000 digitised volumes (approx. 25 million pages) covering 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'General History' and 'Geography' from the Long Nineteenth Century, a period that is arguably the most important in British book illustration. In these years, rapid changes in reproductive techniques were paralleled by changes in the meanings of art and its reception. Art was democratised and book illustrations became more widely collectable and mobile than ever before.  The pages in the dataset are scanned at high resolution and OCR'd and the presence of non-verbal objects found in them is noted. We will use computational methods to identify the visual characteristics of these non-verbal objects (i.e. whether they partake of the nature of maps, diagrams, tables, graphs, significant typographic layout etc.). We aim to add to the available metadata by giving full bibliographical details of the book, the exact location and size of the image, and, where possible, a caption or title, and an artist. In addition, we will develop tools for identifying the re-use of images (in the form of reproductions, re-drawings, recuttings and transmediations). The result will be a web-based interface that provides searchable access to a database of images with accompanying metadata. As such, this project will rescue large numbers of images which would otherwise to all intents and purposes be lost. While the size of the grant does not allow for a full analysis of the subject matter of these illustrations, we shall trial crowd-sourcing methods for assigning tags. We are currently in discussion with a data management SME on how collaboration could increase the effectiveness and decrease the unit cost of semantic tagging on a large scale.  This is a project big in itself, but far bigger in its eventual impact. It has the potential to revolutionise how illustration is understood and the importance accorded to it, to supply an image-hungry commercial world with illustrative material, and to lead to ever more accurate ways of classifying and analysing images in large databases. To deal with issues which arise during the project and to implement an impact strategy which will be felt well beyond it, we have set up a substantial panel of collaborators and external advisers who have expertise in the project itself and both expertise and influence in the world of potential users.","The aim of 'Lost Visions', as the title suggests, is to make thousands of neglected images more widely visible. A database of this size and breadth will have a multitude of potential users. However, we shall work to target the following main constituencies: Librarians: such a large data source will be of interest to libraries in general because of new information about publication and publishing history. Through reference librarians, we can reach members of the public such as those studying aspects of local history, family history and the origins of the modern industrialised world.    General public: the appeal of the database lies in the fact that, as well as making many hitherto neglected images and artists visible to the public eye, it includes some of the 'greats' of the period, including John Everett Millais and Frederic Leighton, and major foreign illustrators such as Retzsch, Gavarni and Gustave Doré.  Education: during workshops for school teachers and pupils held as part of the AHRC-funded DEDEFI project, we identified a need for more historical digital image sources, which this project will provide.  Picture researchers: a large number of images from this period are used on factual television and news and current affairs programmes. The availability of so many images from one source will be of enormous benefit to picture researchers. Trainers of picture researchers e.g. University of Plymouth, Oxford Brookes University, the London College of Communication, the London School of Publishing, Picture Research Courses Online. Employers of picture researchers: the numerous requests from media companies, publishers and advertising agencies for images contained in the Database of Mid-Victorian Illustration (DMVI) suggests that there will be significant demand for images from this much larger database.  Creative artists, including illustrators and graphic designers: this constituency has shown considerable interest in the wood-engraved images in DMVI. This interest will be intensified in a database that encompasses a variety of reproductive techniques and artistic styles. In terms of design and reproductive techniques, the period covered by the dataset is, arguably, the most significant in British book illustration. A period of rapid technological development saw the rise and fall of etching, wood engraving and photomechanical techniques. This collection of illustrations is, in itself, a history of nineteenth-century design that will be of interest to graphic designers and those working in related fields. Book collectors and sellers will profit from the added metadata attached to the volumes Commercial: the project will provide a variety of analytic techniques which are in some degree portable across domains, and, in particular, will provide models of hardware architecture to those carrying out large-scale comparison of images. We are planning a Knowledge Transfer Project with Capture, an SME in digital data management.  Third Sector: the National Art Library Collections, the Department of Word and Image at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Wellcome Library, the House of Illustration. We shall also target holders of specialist image collections, such as Collage (Guildhall Art Gallery and London Metropolitan Archives), the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MA, USA), and the Ashmolean Museum, whose collections will be complemented by our database.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL010194%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This proposed study is in response to the urgency grants highlight notice on impacts on cultural heritage resulting from natural disasters and climate change. In March 2019, devastating floods due to Cyclone Idai left Zimbabwe hard hit and devastated in terms of loss to human life and livestock as well as damage to property (UN Report, 2019). About 270,000 people were affected by Cyclone Idai, approximately 339 died, 15,230 displaced and about 349 are still missing to date. The Government of Zimbabwe and its development partners (international and local NGOs) have been on the forefront assisting the affected communities in Manicaland district with humanitarian aid and with relocating and reconstructing affected communities, especially in Chimanimani, Chipinge and Buhera districts. Hence, the urgent need to conduct this study so that it inputs into the post-Cyclone Idai recovery programme being championed by the Government of Zimbabwe and its development partners.  Climate change induced disasters, such as Cyclone Idai, pose a severe threat to cultural heritage. Cultural heritage plays an important role as a reflection of cultural, historical, and social values, is valuable to national and community identities, and it links to the past, and ongoing social cohesion. However, the adverse effects of climate change induced natural disasters on cultural heritage tend to be considered primarily in connection with tangible or physical cultural properties, such as buildings, monuments, or archeological sites, and less in connection with Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) such as oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, indigenous rituals, kinship systems. For example, the two most pronounced Post-cyclone Idai recovery initiatives in the nine affected districts in Manicaland province; the Zimbabwe Idai Recovery Project (ZIRP) and the Post Cyclone Idai Emergency Recovery and Resilience Project (PCIREP), are mainly focused on livelihoods and infrastructure. ZIRP is focusing on rebuilding community infrastructure and restoring livelihoods through cash transfers, restoring agricultural crops and livestock production. The PCIREP programme is focusing on rebuilding key infrastructure across Zimbabwe, which include transport, electricity, and water and sanitation. None of these programmes are targeted at recovering or restoring the ICH of the affected communities. Intangible heritage faces considerable risks through the scattering of communities such as what happened in the Cyclone Idai hit districts in Zimbabwe where 10,000 houses were destroyed and the families are being relocated to other districts. This type of damage often has a longer-lasting social impact e.g., affect cultural diversity and socio-cultural interactions as families are forced to change their community set up, ways of life, and to compete for resources.  There is urgent need to include ICH within the framework of disaster risk management being used in recovering and rebuilding Cyclone Idai affected communities in Manicaland province in Zimbabwe as cultural heritage is often damaged or destroyed in the aftermath of a disaster due to insensitive conservation, recovery, and reconstruction. Hence, this study is of urgency to provide evidence-based information on the intangible cultural heritage of these affected communities that is useful for sustainable resilience, reconstruction and relocation of the affected communities.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV006436%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Describe the proposed research in simple terms in a way that could be publicised to a general audience [up to 4000 chars]. Note that this summary may be published on the AHRC's website in the event that a grant is awarded. Digitization of 20th Century cultural heritage is severely restricted due to the real or potential subsistence of copyright and related rights. Under the new European laws on orphan works, a large amount of cultural heritage whose copyright status is uncertain could possibly be lawfully digitized by cultural institutions on condition that a ""diligent search"" of the rightholders has been performed. While these diligent searches trigger prohibitively high costs for institutional users, the project designs a cost effective de-centralized system that enables cultural institutions across Europe to source information from end-users and determine the copyright status of works contained in their collections. Ultimately, the project will allow for an enhanced access to 20th Century cultural heritage and will contribute to enable use and re-use of items that would otherwise remain scarcely known and certainly unexploited. Key objectives of EnDOW are: ? To analyse the legal requirement of ""diligent search"" across the orphan works legislation of the 15 countries members of Heritage Plus ? To investigate best practices of orphan works clearance across cultural heritage sectors (libraries, archives and museums); ? (Based on this knowledge:) to design, implement and optimize an online platform for crowd-sourced diligent searching on works contained in the collections of European cultural institutions; ? To study the potential applications and challenges of the crowd-based search method for images, film and born-digital cultural heritage works. Through analytical and empirical approaches to mass digitization, the project will foster knowledge exchange between cultural heritage stakeholders, including small and medium size institutions. It will produce a high-value tool to maximise sustainable management of recent cultural heritage and use and re-use of related cultural artefacts.","Since this project is mainly aimed at cultural heritage institutions (libraries, archives, museums), the expectation is that the public will deal with works that have a high probability of being orphans (for example old books, pictures and films). Users will therefore perform the costly right clearance exercise in place of the involved institutions, and take the relevant steps required by the competent jurisdictions (e.g., mostly contacting the relevant collecting societies) thus clearing the rights for a large amount of artworks, which will become available for use and reuse by the public at large. The EnDOW platform, by allowing low-cost right clearance for potentially orphan works is an extremely high-value tool applicable in the short and medium term to maximise the sustainable management of our cultural heritage, by allowing the use and re-use of cultural artefacts. The outputs of this project will impact on relevant stakeholders in a number of ways: Working closely with institutions potentially involved in mass digitisation of cultural heritage (libraries, museums, archives) in several countries and delivering capacity-building events (conferences, workshops) will maximize the research outputs through knowledge transfer between researchers, institutions, policy-makers and the public. The project will also target voluntaries and communities of artworks users and cultural heritage preservation NGOs, which will find in EnDOW a vehicle to fulfil their mission and to maximise their achievements. Strongly promoting interaction among stakeholders (cultural heritage institutions, academic and no-profit institutions that manage online databases, collecting societies, and the public) will ultimately enhance the dissemination capacity of public institutions and hence public access to cultural heritage artefacts, which in turn will allow further transformative cultural production. To policy-makers, the project will provide pioneeristic solutions to difficult and costly problems, which could later be implemented in other domains. It would serve as a model on the much-debated problem of centralised mass licensing which has hitherto absorbed large investments and it is recognised as a crucial engine for the knowledge economy. To private stakeholders the project can offer an unprecedented testing environment for a new business model, which applies the power of crowd-sourcing to mass licensing of intellectual assets. In conclusion, EnDOW will provide cultural institutions and private stakeholders with unprecedented tools to address the problem of mass digitization, and in particular of right clearance on large scale. This experience has the potential of being further expanded, ameliorated and employed by public and private stakeholders within and beyond the domain of cultural artefacts. This technology will be available on an experimental basis (beta version) at the end of the second year of the project, and it will be available to the public at large at the end of the project. It will be therefore usable in the short to medium term. The high value of this platform is self-explicative: it will substantially erode the costs of mass right clearance without any evident drawback.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN504385%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The research network will investigate aspects of the eating disorder (ED) anorexia nervosa (AN) in males by bringing distinct arts & humanities perspectives to medical and health sciences thus mapping a field of cross-disciplinary enquiry. The collaboration is informed by the AHRC's highlight notice 'Cross-Disciplinary Research Networks Exploring Emerging Areas of Cross-Council Enquiry' and focuses on the AHRC highlighted areas of well-being and mental health.  Whilst EDs in females (e.g. anorexia, bulimia) are being explored fairly extensively in medical and cultural approaches, there is significantly less engagement with male EDs in general and male AN in particular. Despite being perceived as a 'female-only-problem', ED-charities suggest that male AN is an increasing problem in Western countries and highlight the need for greater awareness and more research. The relationship between human beings and food is highly complex and affects many aspects of life, involving biological, psychological, economic, social and cultural factors. This stresses the need for a wider and cross-disciplinary engagement that also takes questions of gender into account. All this makes our proposal timely and highly relevant and emphasizes its potential to stimulate innovative research.  Our network of international UK- and US-based investigators facilitates significant boundary-crossing exchange between medicine, psychiatry, mental health science, education, english, modern foreign languages, linguistics and mathematics to develop a joint research agenda. We also collaborate closely with named partners from 4 ED-charities in our research and impact activities (educational events with schools and UG students, a workshop with teachers, student training events). Our project has significant potential to impact on individuals, health and educational professionals, the wider public and policy-making and for future collaborative work across the disciplines. It is situated in the emerging discipline of health humanities that provides a platform for linking health disciplines with the arts & humanities encouraging innovative applications of the latter to improve the well-being of individuals and societies. It is also informed by the interdisciplinary work of Nottingham's Institute of Mental Health.  At the heart of our network is the desire for further research on, and to raise awareness of, male AN. It explores aspects of male AN in the UK and draws comparisons with North America, Germany, France and Italy in 3 areas of personal narrative: literature (fiction and autobiographical writings), online egodocuments (personal accounts in weblogs and forums), and oral accounts (client-led oral communication in a wider therapy context). Whilst participating researchers from academic institutions bring a distinct arts & humanities perspective to these 3 areas, the proposed key activities are not primarily designed to advance individual disciplines but to spark new conversations with participating scholars from medical and health care sciences. The project facilitates comparisons across different areas and explores how personal narratives can add to the understanding of male AN in a medical and healthcare context. Developing a joint research agenda has the potential to inform and transform the treatment and management of male AN framed by cross-disciplinary research questions: How can personal narratives of male EDs delivered in literature, online egodocuments and client-led oral accounts - help males with AN in an innovative manner? - aid and inform their treatment beyond established medical definitions and paradigms of socio-culturally constructed concepts of disorder and gendered behaviour?  - be used in educating and training health care professionals? - contribute to greater public knowledge, awareness and understanding?  How, in turn, can insights from healthcare professionals aid to the understanding of these 3 types of personal narratives?","The network activities will benefit the following 6 groups: Group 1: School pupils from secondary schools The age group identified by researchers as most vulnerable regarding EDs is early- to mid-adolescence. By holding interactive educational events tailor-made for this age group of boys and girls we will contribute to their education and awareness regarding healthy eating behaviour, (over-)exercising, EDs in general and AN in particular. Sessions are aimed to show pathways to positive body image and building self esteem thus contributing to their well-being and quality of life. In separate informal groups led by a trained male ED-charity facilitator, boys in particular will benefit from an approach that breaks down concepts of AN as a 'female-only' problem and encourages them to voice any issues they may have. All pupils will benefit from personally coming to know charity-workers, some from the local area, who can provide confidential help and support beyond this event and equip them with useful further information and addresses. An additional benefit is that we encourage young people to a campus visit who may not have visited a university otherwise potentially leading to their social, educational and cultural benefits. Group 2: Male undergraduates Another group recognized as vulnerable for EDs is students, particularly in their first year when facing significant life changes. Young men from this group will benefit from our expert-led tailor-made workshops addressing specifically male EDs and AN in the new environment of a university. Other benefits regarding their education, awareness beyond gendered concepts, self esteem, body image, quality of life and well-being are comparable to group 1. They also benefit from being introduced to specific support networks for students: students' counselling and support services and, at UoN, the newly established 'EDs and Students Service' in addition to local charities off campus.  Group 3: Teachers and school staff (e.g. nurses) They will benefit by increasing their knowledge and awareness of male AN in boys and by discussing best practice and integration of the topic into teaching activities. Their recommendations, ideas and concerns will be communicated to policy-makers attending the final symposium with a view to feeding EDs and male AN into the National Curriculum. Group 4: Health and Educational Professionals (in training)  Through 2 training sessions with students in Medicine, Nursing, Psychology, Education and other relevant disciplines the project has the potential to influence the training and approach of future health professionals. Students will benefit from specialist sessions (by First Steps ED-charity, participants, PI and CoI Micali leading UCL's MSc in EDs) on problems and perspectives of recognising and treating male AN. They will benefit further from learning about the importance of cross-disciplinarity and how arts & humanities knowledge and practice (e.g. regarding personal narratives) can enhance well-being and mental health. In addition, opportunities for exchange with other students on different programmes will broaden their horizon helping them to become reflective practitioners.  Group 5: Members of the public Through dissemination of the network's activities in the media and on the website the wider public will benefit from raised awareness for male AN, potentially leading to more caring open-minded communities equipped with information how to seek help and support for themselves and others.  Group 6: Policy-makers The network has the potential to inform and transform policy-making on mental health and EDs in general and male AN in particular by engaging in exchange with government representative and NHS spokespersons during our final symposium and presenting to them at relevant national and international conferences. More awareness regarding male AN, e.g. mirrored in an update of the 2004 NICE guidelines will be of public benefit.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN006356%2F1

Based on outstanding documentary and cartographic resources in Edinburgh, the project team will deploy digital technologies to develop new types of historical maps based on social, cultural, political, religious, military, environmental, architectural and economic information. The project will be structured around the emergent themes of the city's spatial evolution, and guided by the operating principles of cartographic projects eg administrative areas, cadastral plans, and jurisdictions.  The Edinburgh Atlas (E-ATLAS) will provide a new digital atlas of Edinburgh structured around six temporal periods: the early city; medieval city c.1300-1550; the early modern city 1550-1680; Enlightenment Edinburgh, 1680-1820; the 'modern' city, c.1820-1914; the capital city, 1914-2000. The changing nature and structure of the city will form the basis to 30 interpretive essays organised around key themes with analytical emphasis on the processes of change in a spatial context. The E-ATLAS will provide a world-leading innovative intellectual product. The web-based e-atlas provides an internationally innovative research facility. The emphasis will be on customisable maps based on the NLS' 500 digitised Edinburgh maps. As demonstrated by the highly successful and publicly acclaimed open-source tools piloted by the AHRC-funded Visualising Urban Geographies Knolwedge Transfer Project (PI Rodger) (see Attachments for Impact of VUG) users' historical data will be plotted on historical maps appropriate to the period, and saved in personal accounts accessible either by individuals or groups. This customisable web-based delivery will be suitable for researchers at all levels; it will be available to the general public, and by extending the historical frame will have far reaching consequences for scholars and the public.  This provision of an e-atlas facility is a central objective based on a key principle of the project: public accessibility and scholarly additionality (and is consistent with the AHRC 2011-15 strategic emphasis on the Digital Economy and Creative Hubs). By facilitating the publication of newly-created maps of Edinburgh on a variety of topics, the project will demonstrate the utility of spatial analysis for different disciplines. It will assist the development of linkages between acadenic and non-academic users.  The MESH project connects with two other AHRC objectives. First, MESH provides a stimulus to public history by facilitating spatial analysis in a historical setting through the use of user-friendly mapping tools. The project will bring spatial analysis firmly within the grasp of local history societies and voluntary organisations by means of Knowledge Transfer both in a technical environment of web-based mapping, and by providing examples of best practice from experienced historians. Second, the project provides civic authorities, museum curators, and planners with mapping tools (e-atlas) designed which will assist their professional work as they seek to understand the way Scotland's capital evolved.  Public interest in the MESH project is significant and widespread. Representatives of Edinburgh's World Heritage Trust, City Council, RCAHMS, Edinburgh Central Library, and local historical societies have expressed strong support. Graduate and undergraduate students have much to gain from the spatial approach to historical analysis.' In addition to history and geosciences, scholars in several humanities and social sciences disciplines - divinity, literature, archaeology, architecture, criminology - and in biological sciences have expressed considerable interest in the project. In sum, MESH will stimulate and provide a new research resource (E-ATLAS); advance research capacity (e-atlas); develop an online research facility; and enhance user engagement and inter-institutional collaboration within and beyond Scotland's capital.","The project will have considerable impact for (i) the general public (ii) the cultural sector of museums and galleries (iii) public sector policy makers, particularly those in local government and (iv) private interests. (i) General Public. By providing a multi-authored Atlas and a complementary electronic resource with interactive elements, the general public, and local historical societies in particular will be able to explore the historical aspects of their neighbourhoods and communities by generating their own maps on a variety of topics eg population, places of historical interest, architectural features, green space, archaeological sites. This engagement with their locality will enrich communities and contribute to the social capital of the town, village or suburb. Shared community interests have long been favoured by local and central governments as a means of developing place identity and building social responsibility. Websites provide an ideal way of doing this, and the shared knowledge and development of IT skills further contributes to an enrichment of localities. There are active local historical societies throughout the UK who will be beneficiaries. (See Attachments for VUG project outputs and the range of public interests in historical mapping.)  (ii) Cultural Sector - Museums and Galleries. The ability to create maps will enable curators themselves to build in visual and spatial perspectives to their displays eg the location of objects, distribution of activities. Curators will be less dependent on external skills. Since almost all small towns have rich artefacts but too little labour or resources to present these, the ability to produce maps of their locality, and the historical resources in it, will be a considerable advantage. (iii) Local Government. Where public consultation exercises are involved MESH's historical maps will provide the context for policy-makers and a useful visual tool for 'active citizenship', as envisaged under the recent Localism Act for English and Welsh communities and the Community Empowerment Action Plan in Scotland. Spatial and historical knowledge embeds the citizen in a particular locality, and so enriches civil society. Identifying and mapping listed buildings, considering planning proposals, developments in conservation areas, and regeneration plans are just a few of the ways in which the MESH tools and approaches will inform local agencies. MESH also offers the educational sector - schools, FE, HE and U3A - real potential to embed projects more deeply in the locality. Such an awareness forms part of the active citizenship agenda (see above). Historical mapping will achieve this in the short term as pilot studies with Edinburgh University undergraduates have demonstrated.  A sense of place - or place-attachment as it is sometimes described - and a better sense of the changes to place, is one of the major outputs of the MESH project. (iv) Private Interests. Knowing the past and being able to represent it spatially assists commerce. For example, building or engineering firms could locate places of environmental contamination from address-based and mapped historical data, and tender for remediation. Mapping specific business types based on Post Office directories could produce work for a firm. The PI has been working with EDINA to develop the JISC funded project to automate such geo-coding. See http://addressinghistory.blogs.edina.ac.uk/ Historical mapping of the type proposed will enhance the skill base of project staff as well as that of citizens, curators and public officials, and employment options expanded accordingly. Spatial awareness will be increased across a wide range of users; and significant knowledge transfer benefits will accrue from the project. Overall: thematic and address-based historical mapping will contribute to advances in the sense of place-making and place identity. Some benefits would accrue within 3 years.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK002457%2F1

After an intense development process during the MIMIC grant (AH/R002657/1) we have developed a potential paradigm-shifting system that empowers users of programming languages for artistic expression to design their own languages for interfacing with machine learning. This has not been done before and through our user studies and workshops we are confident that our system works. Our project has the potential to demystify machine learning through hands-on use, thus generating understanding and trust in modern AI. It enables non-expert users to engage with creative AI. Now is the time to secure the longevity and wide use of the Sema system promoting understanding of computing through the two pillars of language design and machine learning. The MIMIC project is a direct response to significant changes taking place in the domain of computing and the arts. Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning lead to a revolution in how music and art is being created. However, these are early days concerning the integration of this new technology into software aimed at creatives. Due to the complexities of machine learning, and the lack of usable tools, such approaches have only been usable by experts. In order to study how we might bring these new fruitful technologies of new art making to the people, we created new, user-friendly technologies. They enable laypeople, both composers as well as amateur musicians, to understand and apply these new computational techniques in their own creative work. The unexpected potential for impact we discovered during the development of Sema is twofold:  1) We were going to create a high level live coding language for machine learning. However, responding to survey feedback, we decided to generalise and scale our approach by creating a system for *other people to design their own* live coding languages, using our language grammar compilation technology. This makes artists equally the creators of their own tools as well as the creators of artistic work with those tools. By designing and installing our system online and building a community that contributes to its development, we are effectively collaborating with users in filling a musical toolbox with tools and instruments.  2) During the development of Sema, we become attuned to how distant machine learning is to the general public. People do not easily understand new AI and this technology is often seen as a negative force in society (from automation anxiety, filter bubbles, bias, and algorithms pushing people to the political extremes). Our project enables people to explore machine learning, and thereby gain an understanding of how machine learning and artificial neural networks are designed and trained, through hands-on experience. Music is an ideal platform to give people an understanding of machine learning as it is a collaborative, fun and risk-free environment for experimentation (unlike self driving cars or stock market algorithms). By creating an online resource with our software (including language generator, live coding environment, machine learning architectures and models, and user contributed mini-languages) together with solid documentation and tutorials, we will secure the longevity and impact of our Sema project. Through an extensive user-engagement plan, we will create the conditions for an international community of users to grow independently of our own practice and research. This community will be initially formed by our own workshops, mailing lists, media appearances, social media communication, and dissemination through our own networks of colleagues who teach computer music internationally.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV005154%2F1

The study's research objectives will be a. To understand stakeholders' ethical concerns about the design development and consequences of applying data-driven AI in mental health.  b. To consider the extent to which the stakeholders' ethical concerns are generalizable to the population of mental health service providers and users.  c. To develop enhanced fairness measures for the design of an AI application aimed at mitigating inequalities in NHS mental health services. BACKGROUND Taking injustice, fairness and the development of fairness measures as its guiding goals, the study will enhance existing knowledge about data-driven AI in mental health care by conducting a mixed-methods study that grounds ideas of what is fair data-driven AI in the lived experiences and perspectives of its relevant participants, i.e. ethnic minority service users, information officers, clinicians. This will be principally accomplished via i) the conduct of qualitative interviews with users of mental health services from ethnic minority backgrounds, with information officers, and with clinicians ii) The design and implementation of a quantitative survey, informed by the qualitative findings, that considers the generalizability of the results to a broader population of service providers and users in mental healthcare iii) The development of fairness criteria and measures on the basis of the results of the qualitative and quantitative results.  METHODS The project will be conducted via a combination of qualitative and quantitative research. The intent will be to draw on the qualitative interview data and the quantitative survey data to develop measures for testing the fairness of data-driven AI models for informing decision-making in mental healthcare. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND IMPACT Our key motivation for undertaking the research is to explore the ethical role of fairness when developing data-driven AI to support medical decision-making in mental healthcare. This entails the development of fairness measures and a use case that is anchored in the perspectives and experiences of relevant stakeholders, including services users from ethnic minority backgrounds, information professionals, and clinicians. Given this motivation and commitment, we will be seeking to engage in conversations that explore the prejudices of each of these stakeholder groups towards the data, algorithmic, and doctor-patient decision-making aspects and consequences of adopting data-driven AI. As well as the role of fairness and other ethical aspects related to fairness e.g. equal participation, equal opportunity for patients to contribute knowledge. Via Deliberative Workshops we will seek to facilitate the negotiation and balancing of these different perspectives.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW007630%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Group music-making is a distinctive mode of human social interaction: it is a widespread activity that showcases the remarkable capacity for precision and creativity demonstrated in the coordination of rhythmic behaviour between individuals. Such coordination entails interpersonal entrainment, a process whereby two or more individuals interact with each other in a manner supporting the synchronization of body movements and musical sounds. Although musical entrainment is prevalent across the world's cultures, the way in which it is manifested appears to vary as a function of differences in social, ritual and musical conventions. A better understanding of the process of interpersonal entrainment and its cultural variation is therefore imperative. The main objective of this project is to investigate key aspects of interpersonal musical entrainment in a comparative study of a variety of cultural settings; it does so through the establishment of an international and interdisciplinary team, and by creating and analyzing a shared corpus of prepared and annotated performance data.  Understanding musical entrainment requires contributions from several disciplines, in particular ethnomusicology, music cognition and computing. This project combines perspectives from each of these disciplines: it focuses on better understanding of culture- and genre- specific variations in interpersonal musical entrainment, addressed through both objective measures of entrainment and investigation of subjective perceptions of this coordination, interpreted in the light of ethnographic information about the functions and effects of the music and local aesthetic values.    This ground-breaking, international and interdisciplinary project integrates three complementary approaches. First, we will apply and extend existing methods for the empirical study of interpersonal coordination in music-making. We will emphasize methods for analysing audio and video recordings, in order to carry out comparative analyses from several contrasting cultural settings - including India, Mali, Tunisia, Uruguay and Cuba - rather than being limited to laboratory studies. Secondly, we will conduct a series of experiments to measure listeners' perceptions and judgements of temporal coordination in recorded music extracts. The aim here is to measure both observers' sensitivity to variations in coordination, and their preferences, and to explore how these measures vary between cultures. Finally, we will explore all of these measures in relation to qualitative culture-specific factors: for instance, differences in preference for close coordination as opposed to individual freedom in group activities. The integration of these research strands will give us a much clearer picture of the shared and culturally-varying components of interpersonal musical entrainment.    This collaborative research model is essential if we are to make properly informed comparative studies of a number of contrasting music cultures, and do so with a firm grounding in ethnomusicology, music cognition and the latest computational techniques in video and time series analysis. The aim is both to achieve a step-change in our understanding of musical entrainment - and therefore of social interaction and interpersonal coordination in general - and, by doing so, to establish long-term, international and interdisciplinary research collaborations bridging ethnomusicology, music cognition and computing.","The main groups of beneficiaries we see at this stage are as follows:  1. The general public and selected event organisers and media organisations concerned with popular science. By engaging members of the public with important questions such as ""How do people play music together?"" with the help of illustrations and interactive games and apps, we will communicate messages such as:  a) Playing music together is possible thanks to a range of capacities shared by almost all humans, many of which are unique to humanity b) Whether music sounds good, and feels good to the players, depends on a range of social and personal factors - and these factors can vary, so what sounds good depends on where you come from  We will engage with suitable venues, events and media bodies, and through them with members of the public with an interest in popular science/ psychology and music.    2. Academics and companies interested in developing interactive games and apps applying entrainment research. Such apps would be designed to develop music training and creation tools that facilitate, or draw inspiration from, kinds of interpersonal coordination that may be unfamiliar in a particular cultural context.  Another possible application is to diagnose coordination problems such as deficits in the ability to follow a beat (and the underlying issues that may cause such deficits) and to train users to counteract these difficulties. The main messages to get across to these stakeholders are:  a) We know that the capacity to follow a beat is important and that training clinical populations to move to a musical beat can help people overcome a variety of debilitating conditions (e.g., associated with stroke and Parkinson's disease). However, the variety of ways in which people can coordinate their actions needs to be better understood as this can potentially open up a wider range of clinical applications, e.g. therapy and rehabilitation systems for autistic children and for children suffering from cognitive and/or motoric disabilities.  b) In the field of music training and creation tools, we need to communicate clearly the underlying dynamics of musical coordination, which will open up many new possibilities: for instance, music creation tools that do not simply control beat and tempo but allow virtual rhythmic 'agents', including robots, to interact in controllable ways.  We will present our work to academics and software designers working in these fields, with the aim of stimulating this kind of development.    In both cases, part of our engagement strategy will be to develop simple entrainment apps (e.g. games that encourage players to perform musical tasks in time with one another and give visual feedback on performance). Engagement activity will take place in the UK, Australia and Italy.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN00308X%2F1

Involving a research team from Classics, Geography and Computing, Hestia produced two innovative outcomes: the understanding of geographic space in Herodotus's Histories in terms of connections between places and peoples rather than as points on a map; and the development and use of web technologies for visualising and thinking about a narrative. Hestia2 represents a deliberate shift from experimenting with geospatial analysis of a single text to making Hestia's outcomes available to new audiences through a variety of creative means: (i) a seminar series fostering knowledge exchange of Hestia's spatial analysis of a text between researchers and non-academic communities; (ii) an innovative online platform designed to enhance the experience for general enthusiasts, students and teachers of reading Herodotus and be extensible to other texts with spatial aspects; and (iii) a blog and free learning materials aimed at disseminating Hestia's resources and generating public interest. With the digital medium rapidly transforming the ways in which information is viewed and processed, data visualisation is one of the key challenges to academic and non-academic groups alike. Cultural heritage groups, government agencies and firms working in the digital economy, all have to deal with the problem of presenting big data in ways that make sense to their users but that do not reduce the complexity of the data or give a misleading picture. Hestia2 uses the key intellectual outcome of the original project-the analysis of spatial relations embedded in literary texts-to discuss humanistic approaches to data visualisation which, by virtue of being based on real content that is complex and messy, can help contribute to this debate. In a four-part seminar series, Hestia2 considers: (i) network analysis techniques, methods and models used for data exploration; (ii) the role of GIS in mapping texts; (iii) digital visualisations of data, especially complex literary texts; and (iv) the extent to which digital technologies help non-academics access and comprehend research. To promote wider engagement among teachers, students and general enthusiasts with the original project's re-imagining of the geography of Herodotus's Histories, Hestia2 brings together the disparate technological innovations into a cohesive, intuitive reading interface (called GapVis). This platform allows users to grasp the total distribution of place references at a glance, move through the narrative and see locations appearing and 'fading from memory', and focus on individual places including their relationships to other locations mentioned 'in the same breath'. By trialling Hestia GapVis with an experienced academic innovator, Hestia2 will ensure a robust and user-friendly reading interface fit for the enthusiast, student, teacher and researcher alike. In addition, by using the Pelagios project's index of references for places mentioned in Herodotus, users of Hestia will be able to link to and bring together different kinds of online data associated with those places, from other texts that mention them, artefacts and inscriptions found there, to digital photos of them. To enhance dissemination of Hestia's outputs, all activity will be documented on the blog and disseminated via social media, while free learning materials will be produced to enrich the resource. The blog will promote continuous dissemination and discussion of the findings from the seminars as well as feedback about the GapVis reading interface. By documenting the work of adapting the Hestia dataset to GapVis, Hestia2 also sets down guidelines for other users, who may wish to repurpose GapVis for displaying a text of their own choice that has geospatial elements. Lastly, Hestia2 will work with the OU's OpenLearn unit to build free learning materials that provide context for reading Herodotus in GapVis.","Each activity is directly aimed at benefiting new users who are outside the academic research community.

Hestia2 uses the key intellectual outcome of the original project-the analysis of spatial relations embedded in literary texts-to discuss humanistic approaches to data visualisation which, by virtue of being based on real content that is complex and messy, can help contribute to this debate. In a four-part seminar series, Hestia2 addresses the concerns and interests of four particular groups: (i) English Heritage and the role of network analysis models for data exploration; (ii) Ordnance Survey and the role of qualitative GIS in informing policy debates on place and belonging; (iii) high tech industries and the role of literary texts in developing new visualisation technologies; (iv) educationalists and the role of digital technologies in helping non-academics access to and comprehension of research. These new non-academic communities will gain from using humanities content and approaches to questions of data visualisation. To promote wider engagement with the original project's re-imagining of the geography of Herodotus's Histories beyond academia, Hestia2 brings together the disparate technological innovations into a cohesive, intuitive reading interface (called GapVis). Furthermore, by trialling Hestia GapVis with an experienced academic innovator, Hestia2 will ensure a robust and user-friendly reading interface fit for general enthusiasts, students, teachers and researchers alike. The platform will allow users to grasp the total distribution of place references at a glance, move through the narrative and see locations appearing and 'fading from memory', and focus on individual places including their relationships to other locations mentioned 'in the same breath'. In short, it will allow people to 'read texts' spatially. The Hestia2 blog will disseminate the findings from the seminars and act as a discussion forum of key issues for policy makers, digital technologists and educationalists interested in data visualisation. In addition, by promoting dissemination of Hestia GapVis, the blog will allow the broad user community of teachers, students and general enthusiasts to give feedback and recommend improvements. In particular, the blog will allow key collaborators to reflect publicly on their experience of the project. This will enable the blog to act as an important forum for discussion among different user communities about the qualitative investigation of spatial relations embedded in literary texts, or the use of an integrated suite of visualization tools for reading a text spatially. Similar uses of previous project blogs have met with demonstrable success at both addressing the needs of, and in some ways constructing, user communities: the GAP project has had approx. 30,000 individual visits, while the Pelagios project has had almost 40,000. Both the Hestia2 blog and Hestia GapVis will have Google Analytics installed in order to keep a record of the number, type and geographical spread of the visits, and will use Facebook and Twitter in order to disseminate the project's outputs. Lastly, by building free online learning materials around the Hestia GapVis resource, OpenLearn will greatly increase public awareness of and engagement with this output. In fact, by fully documenting the process of adapting the Hestia dataset to GapVis, the blog will permit anyone else to extend this reading platform to other texts of their choice, which have a geospatial component. This extensibility will have most impact on teachers and students; but publishers may also be interested in this reading platform for viewing texts on e.g. tablet computers.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007025%2F1

In this way they repurposed an aspect of an infrastructure to suit their needs, and capabilities. Through a process of 'Contextual Transposition', this research examines the structural and cultural imperatives of hitching as a mobility practice and, through the development of a design toolkit, uses this knowledge to reveal ways in which other infrastructures may be 'hitched'. In the examples examined here, that of neighbourhood planning and civic action, a whole range of actors may have needs and capabilities that are unfulfilled and untapped, and the proposition being explored here is that a process such as hitching may offer tactics for individuals and organizations to further their objectives in novel ways.","This research experiment is intended to be a direct exercise in academic research acting to provide means and methods of change and action for individuals and organizations. From an academic perspective the intention is to publish a journal article, to be submitted to the Journal of Material Culture, that uses the initial ethnographic and historical work as its basis. In terms of immediate practical effect, the project is being pursued in collaboration with The Glass House Community Led Design who will bring with them their experience of co-designing and disseminating research with higher education, developed over a number of AHRC-funded projects exploring the impact and reach of community-led, participatory and co-design practice. In particular the involvement of their Outreach and Impact Manager, Louise Dredge, will help to ensure the project takes advantage of their knowledge and experience of creative engagement processes and resource development for communities and co-design participants. Also, the extensive Glass-House social networks will be used to help extend the reach and impact of this project and to disseminate findings to those in practice who may benefit from the learning and prototype produced.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003802%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project is an interdisciplinary demonstration of the power of literary geography to offer insight into the vital connections between people, literature and land. The project will create and evaluate an interactive website, The Digital Literary Atlas of Wales and its Borderlands (DLAW). The DLAW will innovatively map twelve classic and contemporary fictions set in Wales in order to challenge outdated approaches to literary geography, and demonstrate the potential of 'new literary geography'. This will be undertaken in order to: 1) encourage the critical and active reading of fictional narratives; 2) promote understanding of how literature can help strengthen individual and community identity; and 3) enhance cultural tourism.  The first phase of the project will create the DLAW. In line with existing approaches to literary mapping, the DLAW will begin with mapping geographical reference points noted in novels. However, these 'distant maps' will be supplemented with 'deep' mapping data, or detailed localities information (including Census data, local histories, and cultural events, in statistical, visual, and written form) about each chosen area. The project will work closely with the Wales Institute for Social and Economic Research (WISERD) who co-ordinate this data and will support its translation onto the DLAW. Coupled to this, the DLAW will offer the reader the opportunity to position themselves within the location by mapping walking routes which explicitly outline the connections between fiction and places. These routes will be supplemented with directions, author commentaries, narrative excerpts, critical discussion, images and sound. The DLAW will also introduce a new way to engage readers with literary geography through superimposing excerpts from fictions onto images from the mapped routes. By engaging with technological developments in web design and geographical mapping, readers will be able to 'scroll' through these placed stories on their computer, as easily as turning the pages of a book or atlas. Due to the digital nature of this resource, users will also be able to follow these augmented routes in a practical sense too, walking them in real places, maintaining virtual support from a wifi tablet or smartphone connection. Active at the end of phase one, the DLAW will be an open access public resource, democratizing access to literary maps, narrative debates, and real places. The DLAW will function as a site through which all individuals will be able to re-imagine their relations between literature and geography.  The second phase of the project will critically evaluate the benefits of the DLAW, both economically and culturally. This phase will be split into three parts. Firstly, the project will appraise the cultural potential of the DLAW to encourage reading and stimulate interest in particular localities. 18 focus groups will be recruited to examine how the DLAW changes the ways in which readers engage with fictions and their geographies. Secondly, 12 literary tours will be undertaken with the focus groups, 2 of which will be public events, managed and publicized by Project Partner Literature Wales. These events will take the form of walking tours held with the authors of the fiction or academic experts, and give the public the opportunity to engage with the fictions, experts, and locations in practice. During these tours, participants will be interviewed and surveys undertaken to evaluate the cultural and economic value of the DLAW. Thirdly, online surveys will appraise the interest generated in fiction and location through the DLAW. The broader insights on the power of literary mapping to change the ways we read, write, and experience literature, and the cultural and economic benefits of doing so, will have impact beyond Wales. The third phase of the project will communicate these insights in policy reports, academic papers, international festivals, conferences, open public events, and the DLAW itself.","This project will secure positive impact to publics in Wales, and open pathways to secure positive impact to publics beyond Wales, through demonstrating how innovation in literary geography can secure a wide range of social benefits.  To plotline communities, the project will offer distant and deep maps of localities to enable a fresh interrogation of their own, and others' history, landscape, and literature; To local communities in general, the project will stimulate a reconsideration of the importance of literature in generating a sense of community identity and pride in literary heritage;  To disability groups within a community, the project will secure benefit to those with restricted vision through offering specialised audio engagement with fictions (including excerpts from novels, author interviews, and expert commentaries), and for those with restricted mobilities, the site's augmented reality (including scrolling stories in virtual reality and GIS mapping) will enable engagement with literature and landscape in new, empowering, ways. To writing and other education groups within local communities (including lifelong learning and school groups) the project will perpetuate a sense of community identity and pride, as well as ownership of the DLAW, through offering individuals the opportunity to contribute their own micro-fictions to the ongoing cartographies of the DLAW; To walking groups, the project will secure benefit through offering literary walking guides that can stimulate and sustain active lifestyles; To libraries and publishers, the project will secure long term benefit through stimulating interest in books, guides, and maps associated with the DLAW; To book clubs, the project will offer a new way to engage with literature and enhance enjoyment of the written word; For literary organisations such as the Welsh Books Council, the project will provide sustained interest in Welsh literature. For the general public the project will secure benefit through providing specific educational events (literary tours, managed by Project Partner Literature Wales) to contribute to the knowledge, skills, and quality of life of participants;  To businesses and the Welsh economy, this project will create financial impact through attracting tourists and other visitors to an area through the promotion of local literature via the DLAW;  For organisations such as Literature Wales, the DLAW website will diversify and strengthen the educational and cultural support available to all their public events, offer a legacy that can record and capture the 2017 events for future access and use by all, and reposition the organisation as a key contributor to literary tourism; For institutions such as Visit Wales and the Welsh Government, the project will generate impact through understanding the role of literature in enhancing and reinforcing a sense of pride and place at the local and national level, and through doing so, feed directly into cultural tourism policy by offering briefing papers which outline new ways to understand and evaluate literary tourism and its economic benefits at the local, national, and international levels.  By demonstrating these long term social benefits at the local and national level, the project will provide evidence for the scalability and transference of the ideas behind the DLAW to other areas of the UK and beyond, as well as the potential to diversify the DLAW to include new genres, literary forms (e.g. poetry), and other cultural media (e.g. songs and films). In these ways, this project will secure a range of sustained benefits beyond the lifetime of the project that will have a lasting legacy on both economies and communities in both Wales, the UK, and other countries.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003764%2F1

Today, our knowledge of the ancient history of Arabia is derived largely from external sources (Assyrian, Greek, Roman, etc.) or the often somewhat garbled accounts by historians in the Islamic period. Although excavations have taken place in the rest of the Middle East for more than 150 years, they have only been undertaken in the Gulf, Oman and Yemen for the last 60, and only in recent decades in Saudi Arabia which covers the major part of the Peninsula. Moreover, a significant section of the population in historical times has always been nomadic and the archaeology of nomadic societies has not yet begun in Arabia. However, we have another rich source of information. For Arabia was unique in the ancient world in that while literacy was widespread among the settled populations it was apparently almost universal among the nomads. Between the mid-1st millennium BC and the 4th century AD these nomads covered the rocks of the Syro-Arabian deserts with tens of thousands of graffiti. These give us a vivid picture of their way-of-life, social structures, personal emotions, and relations with each other and with the settled peoples of Arabia and beyond (Romans, Jews, Nabataeans, etc.), information which is almost entirely lacking for Middle Eastern nomads at any other period. These, with the monumental inscriptions and graffiti of the settled peoples, are the only indigenous written sources we have for the ancient history of most of Arabia. These texts are the only source for a group of dialects known as Ancient North Arabian (ANA) which are related to Arabic but distinct from it, and are written in alphabets unique to Arabia. In addition to the historical information they contain, they are of fundamental importance for Comparative Semitics, the history of the alphabet, and the study of ancient literacy. While they provide the key to understanding ancient Arabia, they are also an important source for the ancient Near East in general. For Arabia was geographically and strategically central to the region, and its peoples had links from Anatolia to Ethiopia and from the Mediterranean to India, through the lucrative trade in Arabian frankincense and luxury goods from across the Indian Ocean. The study of these texts has a distinguished history but they are now very difficult to access since they are scattered in numerous books, articles and unpublished theses, with no research tools. As a result of this and other factors, the history, languages and cultures of ancient Arabia are no longer taught at any university in Europe or North America, at a time when scholars in many different fields are showing an ever increasing interest in them. OCIANA will reverse this situation by making this treasure-house of material readily available by: (1) creating in 2 stages an easily updatable, online corpus of the approximately 48,000 ANA texts known so far; (2) producing a large range of online, easily updatable, research tools from the texts in OCIANA; (3) training 2 post-doctoral researchers and a doctoral student in ANA epigraphy and the languages, history and cultures of ancient Arabia; (4) enabling them to make international contacts through the project's partnerships, workshop and conference. Thus, while holding posts in Arabic, Semitics, ancient Near Eastern history or other fields they will be able to continue research on ancient Arabia and, it is hoped, eventually restore the subject to university curricula.","In addition to its value to academic beneficiaries discussed in the previous section, this project will have an impact both outside and within academia in three principal ways. First and most important, at a time when much of the archaeological, historical and linguistic heritage of Arabia is threatened or being destroyed through vandalism and development, OCIANA provides both a means for the preservation of that heritage and a tool by which it may be more effectively studied, disseminated and appreciated. Many of the inscriptions included in OCIANA have already been lost, and many more will disappear during the course of the project. Road-building, the construction and spread of settlements, agricultural projects and oil and gas pipelines have all taken a toll, while easy access to almost all parts of the peninsula in 4x4 vehicles has resulted in inscriptions and rock art being deliberately vandalized or covered with spray-paint graffiti. Transcriptions, drawings and photographs are the only surviving records of many of these carvings, but the majority of these records are either unpublished or appeared in books and articles which are very difficult to access, even for specialists. Yet they represent a major part of the heritage of the Arabian Peninsula. The dialects recorded in these inscriptions are found nowhere else and have features which appear to be unique among the Semitic languages. What is more, the history of pre-Islamic Arabia has until now been written almost entirely from external sources. These inscriptions are virtually the only indigenous accounts which can balance the historical narrative and as such should be a source of pride to the inhabitants of Arabia. In the past, Saudi Arabia in particular has denigrated its pre-Islamic past, but the present king (both before and after his accession) has fostered a much greater interest in the ancient history of the kingdom. The astonishing extent of literacy in ancient Arabia has provided a wealth of data for reconstructing its history, and this project will help that process by making available the content of these texts. We are already working with Saudi scholars who have recorded large numbers of ANA inscriptions and are anxious to use the material provided by OCIANA in their research and teaching. The project's conference on the contribution of ANA and Old Arabic inscriptions to our understanding of ancient Arabia, and of the milieu in which Islam emerged, will be used to publicize this precious resource among a much wider range of potential users, both in Arabia and abroad, such as museums, tourism planners, heritage managers, writers, TV and radio programmers, etc. Second, the project will also be important in increasing western understanding of the historical background of a crucial but little understood area of the Middle East. OCIANA and the research publications for which it will provide the material will form the basis for more popular studies of ancient Arabia which will contradict the belief that the Peninsula was always populated simply by illiterate camel-herding nomads, and demonstrate that, on the contrary, for almost 1000 years the nomads were literate and at the same time Arabia has always been a place of commerce and often of conspicuous consumption in permanent settlements. OCIANA will provide the material for presenting to the West a more accurate and nuanced picture of ancient Arabia, and thereby of its modern successor, which will enter the popular consciousness through general histories, museum displays and exhibitions, and documentaries on radio and television. Third, we hope that the pooling of the information from OCIANA in Oxford and CSAI in Pisa, via the European Research Council's DASI portal, with significant input from several partners in the Arab Middle East, will provide a model for other international IT collaborations.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK00316X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Of the things very distant from immediate human concerns - the very small, the very distant, events in the distant past, processes happening over very long periods of time - it is commonly assumed that science can, and does, give us knowledge. Perhaps science got many things wrong in the past, but it is assumed that many/most contemporary scientific theories are definitely on the right lines, if not plain true; this is scientific realism. But what makes us so sure we are right now, when we have been wrong so often in the past? If genuine scientific practice can readily lead to false theories of the very small, the very distant, etc., doesn't that cast significant doubt on what is today commonly referred to as 'scientific knowledge'? Philosophers of science have spent more than thirty years refining their response to this challenge. This project addresses one of the most sophisticated contemporary scientific realist positions, summarised by the following claim: When a scientific theory (broadly construed) brings about substantial scientific successes (e.g. novel predictions), then the elements of that theory which *did the work* to bring about those successes are very likely at least approximately true. Call this selective scientific realism. Despite deep issues concerning several of the key concepts here, there is widespread agreement that selective scientific realism can be tested by the history of science. That is, one can look to specific episodes in the history of science to see whether they support this claim. One can think of the position as analogous to a scientific theory which has been put forward, warranting extensive and thorough tests. But the position has not been thoroughly tested by the historical record: philosophers have focused on the same few cases for the past thirty years. In addition, philosophers have not adequately tracked the contemporary realist responses; in particular, they have not adequately concerned themselves with identifying the components of the theory that were responsible for novel predictive success. This lacuna in the literature is addressed by this project. By analysing and assessing a range of new cases identified in previous work by the PI and Co-I, it will make a step-change contribution to assessing the viability of selective scientific realism. More precisely, the guiding research question (GRQ) will be as follows: GRQ: Which cases in the history of science threaten selective realism, and which substantive versions of selective realism (if any) are capable of addressing those cases? The reference to different 'versions' is necessary, since there are different takes on what should be meant by 'did the work', 'approximately true', and so on.  The specific historical episodes to be initially considered have been selected by the PI and Co-I from previous work. The most promising candidates to move the debate forward significantly can be divided into three groups: (i) cases from thermodynamics, (ii) cases from the history of chemistry, and (iii) cases from the history of biology and medicine. These have also been selected according to the historical work that has already been done, and is currently being done. For example, Ben Marsden (Aberdeen) is currently completing a major work on the history of thermodynamics, and Holger Maehle (Durham) has recently been at the forefront of relevant work in the history of medicine, concerning drug receptors. And Kyle Stanford has recently introduced two fascinating examples from the history of biology, but the philosopher is yet to draw on a wealth of historical work which has been done on these cases.","WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH? In addition to philosophers of science and philosophers more generally, a number of academics who are not philosophers and not in the immediate professional circle of the PI and Co-I (e.g. historians, scientists, and sociologists) will benefit in various ways (see Academic Beneficiaries for more here). Interested lay-persons (the general public) will benefit intellectually from the website, radio episodes, public lecture, and the tailored 'popular' article (see Pathways to Impact for more detail of these activities).  Other beneficiaries include science journalists and communicators, scientific advisors, health professionals, ethics committees, and public relations officers for high-energy physics experiments such as those involving the Large Hadron Collider. HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH? Ultimately the project concerns the question of what exactly we should trust in science, and how much we should trust it (given the lessons of the history of science). A better understanding on this issue has the potential to filter down into the wider community and affect various actions in indirect ways. The hope is that people working in science-related professions would then benefit by being able to communicate more effectively with public consumers, because of a greater understanding of how science works on both sides of the discussion. For example, a greater understanding of what exactly we should trust in science, and how much we should trust it, could be extremely significant in a discussion between a health professional and a patient, and directly affect consequent actions (the case studies on the history of medicine and biology will be most relevant here). Similarly in a discussion between scientists and an ethics committee, between scientists and a policy maker, or between news broadcasters and the public relations officer of a high-energy physics experiment. Public opinion on science has a major influence on which actions are open to persons working in a range of science-related professions, and this project will affect public opinion which in turn will affect those actions. For example, we don't just need better informed decisions concerning issues of scientific policy at government level; we need the public to understanded where those decisions come from, and to support them. For information on how we will ensure that these impacts come about, see the Pathways to Impact attachment.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL011646%2F1

'Listening to the Commons' brings political history into dialogue with creative digital acoustic technology, virtual reality and buildings archaeology to explain how women participated in Commons debates long before they were formally enfranchised in 1918. Through 'Vote 100', Parliament is spearheading this 100th anniversary with a major series of events and exhibitions. Listening to the Commons will contribute to Vote 100 by adapting a 3D visual model of the historic Commons chamber constructed by the AHRC 'St Stephen's Chapel' project, to recover the soundscape of debate as experienced by women listening through a ventilator in the old House of Commons ceiling around 1800. Between 1548 and 1834 the House of Commons met in the converted royal chapel of St Stephen in the Palace of Westminster. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the Commons witnessed intense debates which came to define modern Britain: the abolition of the slave trade, the ethics of capital punishment, the Reform Bill extending the franchise to working-class men. Women had often watched Commons debates from the public galleries, but in 1778 they were ejected following complaints from some MPs. Women responded by occupying the space above the Commons ceiling, accessed by a ladder, where the architecture of the medieval St Stephen's chapel was still visible. Surviving drawings show women watching and listening through the ventilator. Our follow-on activity focuses on this little-known but highly significant space. Acoustic and virtual reality technologies create an exciting new opportunity to develop the 3D model of the historic Commons chamber, created as part of the St Stephen's Chapel project, to model the soundscape of the Commons. Listening to the Commons will scale up this existing 3D model for the incorporation of historic sound. Building on a successful University of York Research Priming Fund pilot project to test out this idea, we will model the ventilator space and produce auralisations (the audio equivalent of visualisation) to enable us to recover the experience of women listening to Commons debates. We will explore the important narrative of women's engagement with Parliament at this time through this hidden space. Translating our results for a virtual reality experience will deliver a novel, historically and politically important, high profile example of how arts and humanities research can communicate with new cultural and heritage partner audiences via technology founded in the creative economy. The 3D visual and acoustic model, auralisations, and VR representation will be incorporated in the 'Vote 100' exhibition in Westminster Hall (July-Oct 2018). Exhibition visitors will experience debate from the perspective of women commenting on the all-male world of the House of Commons, dispelling the myth that women were absent from parliamentary politics before the twentieth century. The digital audio and VR content produced will be made accessible and shareable to provide further outreach for this exhibition and dissemination of this work. Listening to the Commons brings together three centres of expertise at York - the Dept of History, Dept. of Electronics Audio Lab, and the Digital Creativity Labs - into collaboration with the 'Vote 100' team, and this follow-on initiative develops the already strong relationship between the University of York and Parliament established by the St Stephen's project. Combining innovative digital technologies to highlight the deep history of women's participation in politics, our follow-on collaboration with Parliament's 'Vote 100' project will make a compelling demonstration of the impact of AHRC-funded research in the creative economy to engage new audiences and enable modern people to hear new histories told in new ways.","Listening to the Commons builds on the University of York and UK Parliament collaboration established in the AHRC St Stephen's Chapel project. This follow-on activity is based on leading arts and humanities research, for the first time collaborating with innovative creative sector work in virtual reality, audio technology, acoustics and heritage. Through Parliament's Vote 100 Project and York's Digital Creativity Labs, Listening to the Commons will deliver impact in the Creative Economy to engage new audiences in culture and heritage and enable modern people to hear new histories in new ways. Beneficiaries include Vote 100 and UK Parliament, the public via the Vote 100 exhibition, and those working with creative economy focused audio and VR technology in the cultural and heritage sectors. The Vote 100 exhibition will benefit from the digital 3D visual, acoustic, audio and VR assets produced. Making these resources available online ensures they have a role beyond the visitor experience at the exhibition itself and we will use low-cost VR headsets to maximise dissemination and engagement opportunities for this novel creative content. We are working to engage MPs as part of the creative process, using them as our actors for the recording of historic debates. Positively received, discussions are underway with Parliamentary authorities on how the practicalities can be accommodated. Listening to the Commons therefore supports Parliament's own public engagement aims (Business plan 16/17: Enhancing public engagement and participation especially through digital means) and the assets created will be used beyond the 2018 exhibition as an education and outreach resource. More than 100,000 people are expected to visit the Vote 100 exhibition. Audiences, both present and online, will benefit from opportunities to digitally engage with the exhibition content. We will contribute to Vote 100's media and engagement strategy, and BBC Parliament are keen to follow up their recently broadcast St Stephen's project TV documentary. Listening to the Commons will therefore play a significant role in the culture (through the digital narratives developed) and economy (through audience attendance) of the UK. Listening to the Commons will benefit partners in the creative economy with an interest in VR technology, a significant business opportunity, particularly in its potential for developing novel, engaging narratives for audiences within cultural and heritage sectors. This will be facilitated through Project Steering Group members from cultural (York Museums Trust) and business (Knowledge Transfer Network) sectors, together with the DC-Labs remit to deliver research focused impact in the creative digital economy via their 80+ partners, including companies already developing VR for gaming (Sony), broadcast (BBC, BT) and engineering (Arup, AECOM). We will disseminate outcomes through three impact workshops as well as existing DC-Labs channels and author a paper on the project process and outcomes for audiences from both academia and industry. Acoustic data will be published via OpenAIR, an online resource already creating impact in sound design, digital heritage and gaming, and so therefore also benefitting these creative communities. Impact with Vote 100 will be realised as the exhibition opens in July 2018. Audience numbers will be monitored, and we will commit at least one University of York Institute of Public Understanding of the Past internship to the capture and evaluation of ongoing impact related to audience engagement with our work. Impact in the creative economy will be developed during the lifetime of the project through three key workshops with ongoing impact captured through existing DC-Labs activities (2020 end date). The Named PDRA will develop new skills in VR development and their placement within the DC-Labs multi-disciplinary, impact-focused research environment will further opportunities for them across employment sectors.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP012094%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              ""A phenomenon with opportunities"" expands the reach and enhances the impact of a prize-winning, on-line, educational innovation in environmental storytelling about the El Niño Phenomenon (ENP). This initiative was piloted in June 2019 as part of participatory qualitative data collection for AHRC project ""Fishing and Farming in the Desert? A Platform for Understanding el Niño Foods System Opportunities in the Context of Climate Change in Sechura, Peru"", and in response to COVID-19 restrictions on face-to-face, in person teaching in Peru. On-going research is exploring how livelihoods in poor communities have historically taken advantage of ENP rains and temporary lagoons that form in the Sechura desert. ""A phenomenon with opportunities"" targets secondary school students in Sechura province (northern Peru), where 61.9% of the population live in poverty. Here, the state has identified low education rates as a key dimension of poor levels of social inclusion (MIDIS 2013). Working with Peruvian NGO collaborator PRISMA, the Unidad de Gestión Educativa ([UGEL]: Sechura School Board) and a desert secondary school, Instituto Educacional Daniel Alcides Carrión, storytelling training will develop on-line, digital, and research skills for a cohort of 115 students and scale-up this experience to impact curriculum development for 154 schools and 21,059 students in the wider Sechura area. In so doing, it addresses urgent concerns about the unequal impacts of COVID-19 on learning opportunities globally. The findings and province-wide experience will be reflected upon with leading national education stakeholders via a Lima-based workshop to generate national dialogue. By conducting their own inter-generational research about El Niño, its history and livelihoods impacts, young people will learn about the cross-cutting economic, cultural and social dimensions of climate related challenges. Through tailored on-line training, students' research projects will reflect on the desert-El Niño food system and its management, including the often less-visible roles played by women. In this way students will absorb understandings of equitable resilience for their futures, as they themselves transition through their teenage years into adulthood.  To widen impact and engage a broader public, new partnerships led by PRISMA with the local museum and heritage sector will take the project's participatory practices and outcomes beyond school platforms. Museums have great potential to serve and catalyse sustainable development agendas. Yet this potential remains untapped in many provincial, non-metropolitan contexts like the arid regions of northern Peru. PRISMAs partnership with the Municipality of Sechura, an existing ""Fishing and Farming in the Desert"" project collaborator, will enable work with the Ethnographic Museum and Ecological Park, linking students' storytelling with museum artefacts digitisation. These will be curated for public outdoor learning and become focal points for inter-generational sharing and exposition. Through a strategic partnership with the Royal Geographical Society, curriculum development will also target an international audience, generating a bi-lingual interactive web resource on El Niño, animated by storytelling and digital imagery produced by Sechura students and targeted at secondary and primary students in Peru and the UK. Aligned with national curricula requirements in both settings the project has the potential to generate a unique model of international curriculum dialogue grounded in equitable partnerships. The voices of the provincial, marginal, desert communities, and even less the children who grow up in them, are seldom heard in development forums. By bringing desert-El Niño livelihoods experiences to light, across generations and internationally, this impact and engagement project will raise awareness of the importance of local knowledge and help insert ENP into policy agendas as 'a Phenomenon with Opportunities'.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV012215%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This network will address a common problem for all disciplines, how to articulate the invisible, that which is not known or that which is not provable. The challenge for academics is how to articulate these concepts, firstly to those within academic field and then beyond, to other disciplines and the public at large. Furthermore, as our understanding of the complexity of the world grows incrementally, so our realisation that issues and problems can rarely be resolved within neat demarcations. Therefore the importance of finding means of communicating across disciplines and fields becomes a priority. So whilst acknowledging the essential importance of the specialist academic, the capacity to understand other disciplines, their priorities, methodologies and even the language used can become crucial in being an effective instrument for change. This project brings together a number of leading academics from a wide range of disciplines including Art & Design, Curatorial Practice, Literature, Forensic Science, Fashion, Medical Science, Psychoanalysis & Psychotherapy, Philosophy, Astrophysics and Architecture who have all expressed interest in exploring how, in each discipline, we strive to find expression for the invisible or unknown. It is anticipated that as the project develops, further disciplines will be added. The project takes as its starting point, a closed workshop where the core members of the network will present to each other and discuss areas of convergence and separation. Through the interpretation of the various network members, it will set the agenda and provide common ground from which to develop wider multi-disciplinary debates. Sir John Soane's Museum, who will host the workshop, is an ideal backdrop for a cross disciplinary investigation of the invisible. The museum encompasses a wide range of concerns including social history, architecture, conservation & museology. The concept of the invisible is evident in, not only the plethora of speculative models and drawings but also with Soane's, the fascination with the afterlife, his attempts at memorialisation and the imaginative projection of how his buildings would survive as ruins. This will be followed by an exhibition by the PI at the museum of new work entitled ""Picturing the Invisible - The House from Below"" made as a response to the museum's collection, and seeks to make apparent the invisible presence of the servants and to focus the public on what is absent within the museum and how this can be made concrete. The exhibition will function as a way of addressing the idea of the invisible and will be an example of practice based research. The informal setting is designed to encourage speculative thinking and free exchange outside of the regular teaching environment.  A website/blog will capture discussions from the events from which the participants will develop formal papers for presentation at the network conference to be held at Chelsea College of Arts (UAL). The conference will also be open to PhD students and early career researchers and will provide not only a forum for exchange but also a platform from which other cross and interdisciplinary projects might grow. A further aspect of the project is to provide a network for the support of cross and interdisciplinary research. The papers from the conference will form the basis for an edited book to be published by UCL Press written to address a non-specialist audience and ensure that the results of the network reach a wide audience. A further publication will take the form of a special edition of the journal Art in Print (edited by Susan Tallman) in which network members will discuss selected prints as a means of articulating the invisible as seen from their discipline's perspective.","The PI's exhibition at the Sir John Soane's Museum will provide an initial entry for the public into the project. The annual attendance at the museum is around 100,000 visitors so for the duration of the exhibition an estimated 25,000 will visit. This would include four key groups that will engage with the project including, the museum's general visitors, a fine art audience, attendees for the public programme and online visitors accessing the monthly blog which will open up the research and development to a broad audience. The target audience include those interested in architecture, social history, private collections, contemporary art and museums who are either familiar with the museum or first time as a result of the exhibition, regular contemporary art attendees overseas visitors drawn by the nature of the exhibition and/or Soane's reputation and a global audience for both contemporary art and museums. Through the public events at the Soane Museum and the participants' existing networks, the project will engage the broad general public who will be encouraged to participate in the blog and the issues raised will inform the research papers and the scope of the conference. The conference will be structured to maximize audience participation with round table discussions framing each session. The benefit to the public, participants and academics will be to provide a range of fora in which ideas across disciplines can be freely exchanged. This will be predicated on a use of language which is accessible to non-specialist audiences. The network will benefit those who seek references and collaboration beyond their own specialism as well as for those who need to communicate across disciplines and understand problems from a range of perspectives such as that of broadcasters, politicians and policy advisors. It will enable this group to approach problems and issues from a wider perspective and ensure that the language used is appropriate for the audience they wish to address.  In summary, the principle means of seeking impact will be aimed at a broad audience both within and beyond academia. This will achieved be through the exhibition at the Sir John Soane's Museum, the website and blog, the conference and call for papers, the conference publication with UCL Press and through the special edition of Art in Print. In addition it is through the forging of a network centred on the initial participants but outward looking to draw and build upon existing networks that will ensure a rich legacy. In conclusion the network sets out to challenge people to think outside tradition boundaries and place importance of risk taking. 'Imagination is not fragile. It feeds off flaws, difficulties, and problems.

"Funding details                                                                                                              Auralisation, the audio equivalent of visualization, enables us to audition virtual acoustic environments that once existed, will exist or that are purely fictional. Auralisation is based on obtaining the acoustic room impulse response (RIR) of a space, through measurement if the building already exists, or otherwise via simulation using computational modelling. The result is a 3D acoustic rendering of any sound we wish to hear within the auralised environment. This research plays a key role in architecture, environmental noise assessment, recreating past environments in digital heritage, as well as enabling creativity in music production, broadcast and computer gaming. The WEb Audio Virtual Environment Rendering (WEAVER) project will revisit the concept of spatial audio composition and rendering in relation to the last ten years of development in auralisation and virtual acoustics research. Since this research started in 2004, the specialised audio technology required to explore spatial composition using virtual acoustics, auralisation, acoustic measurement and modelling is now commonplace in most creative computer music software applications. Acoustic RIR measurements from various sites, buildings and venues, many of significant heritage value or interest have also been gathered and disseminated over this ten-year period via the online Open Acoustic Impulse Response Library (OpenAIR: www.openairlib.net). Over this time OpenAIR has become a key resource for electronic musicians, sound designers, software and computer game developers. Much of the functionality required to explore and audition spatial audio content and virtual acoustic environments can now, in fact, be offered via a standard web browser and mobile device - additional acoustic RIR data is still needed to auralise these virtual spaces, but the ability to use or listen to these results is now carried by millions of potential users worldwide.  WEAVER will use the Web Audio API to deliver interactive virtual acoustic environments via a web browser, and to further realise some of the creative research aims first articulated over ten years ago. In combination with the research and resources related to OpenAIR, that was also an outcome from this initial work, WEAVER will develop impact and engagement in online sonic art, digital heritage and broadcast. WEAVER will create novel online sonic art from OpenAIR data. We will scope the Web Audio API to detail its capabilities for developing creative virtual acoustics applications informed by existing examples and current practice, and provide a route to impact through the development of new user contacts for OpenAIR content. We will work with York Theatre Royal, a regional producing theatre based on a historic site that has hosted a working theatre since 1744, to develop a web resource to engage new audiences with the redevelopment and heritage of the theatre's auditorium space. This presents a unique opportunity to apply our virtual acoustics research in a culturally and historically significant venue during its refurbishment. We will help York Theatre Royal to tell their story and engage new audiences using our expertise in acoustic heritage, auralisation and sound design, brought together through the development of novel, interactive online content. With BBC Audio Research we will investigate how virtual acoustic rendering informs the experience of listening to audio broadcast material. WEAVER will expand on existing BBC spatial audio rendering for broadcast to include differently rendered virtual acoustic and playback listening environments, and will make use of BBC facilities and test platforms for reaching audiences in order to gain feedback on the effectiveness and future viability of this presentation technology. At all stages data and code developed will be disseminated by open-source/open-access means, encouraging maximum potential impact for WEAVER and the resources it creates.","The WEAVER follow-on project will build on research in spatial audio composition and rendering by using the Web Audio API, together with OpenAIR data, to deliver interactive virtual acoustic content for the web, so developing new pathways to impact and engagement in online sonic art, digital heritage and broadcast. The main WEAVER beneficiaries are the partners who have shaped its content and direction. York Theatre Royal (YTR) will use audio/image data, as gathered from the current theatre space throughout the existing refurbishment and beyond, to animate the history of the building and the site. The digital heritage community, both researchers and those managing museums, galleries and heritage sites, will also benefit from the learning developed from the design of the online materials for engagement that will be produced from this partnership.  WEAVER will enable BBC Audio Research to enhance their existing spatial audio rendering applications to include virtual acoustic and multiple playback options. Through our partnership we will further promote this work to the relatively new Web Audio community, who have recently hosted their first international conference with the BBC already active as contributors. Additionally, audiences for both YTR and BBC will benefit from the enhanced opportunities that will be offered through WEAVER to digitally engage with the creative content that these organisations curate and deliver. The wider creative music technology community will also benefit from outputs produced in terms of the novel sonic art created, code developed and RIR data that will be curated and made available online via OpenAIR. OpenAIR has already created impact in computer music, digital heritage and computer gaming. WEAVER will also deliver impact in the area of computer music, extending to the web developer community through the novel use of OpenAIR data and the Web Audio API. Both data and code developed will be made open-source/open-access, encouraging maximum potential impact for WEAVER and the resources it creates. As the Web Audio community is relatively new, there is a good opportunity to make an early contribution to the field with lasting impact. WEAVER will enhance the offering and potential audiences for our two high profile partners through the novel online content created. YTR and the BBC are part of the UK's Creative Industries, a socially important, export driven industry, and one of the UK's leading industrial sectors. Digital technology increasingly helps to drive the creative industries, and interactive digital media is becoming more important in conveying narrative and factual entertainment to audiences. Collaborating with our partners at this early stage in Web Audio's development maximizes the potential impact for our work given the national reputation of YTR and the global reach of the BBC. York has recently been designated as UNESCO City of Media Arts, providing an umbrella under which the collaboration with YTR has additional opportunity to make a global impact, with related benefit to the local, regional and UK economy.  Impact developed with YTR will become more beneficial as the theatre reopens in late 2015/early 2016, and starts on the next phase of its own development. WEAVER is also planned to start then, and benefits should be evident within the timescale of the project into the medium term. Integrating with the BBC's online technology will enable WEAVER outputs to deliver impact into the future based on their wider use and rollout. The Audio Research Partnership encourages further collaboration beyond the project timescale and joint dissemination to audiences in academia and industry is anticipated. The project RA will develop professional skills in audio, web authoring and coding through engagement with the requirements of our two partners, coupled with a valuable industry placement with the BBC that will further opportunities for them across employment sectors.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN00356X%2F1

"Funding details                                                                                                              It is widely understood that the public sector in general and public services in particular need to be radically reshaped inorder to meet the needs of citizens in the context of diminishing public financing. Less well understood are the ways andmeans by which to do so. This one-year project explores the potential for, and value of, design-led research to addresssocietal challenges and to inform policy. It does this through establishing a 'Public Collaboration Lab' (PCL), a strategicresearch collaboration between local government (London Borough of Camden), the citizens they serve, and an HigherEducation institution (University of the Arts London). The project will use social innovation approaches to engage citizens and other societal actors in the co-design and co-delivery of some aspects of public services. These 'public and collaborative' approaches to service delivery (servicesdelivered with and by citizens and other agencies) seek to mobilise citizens as 'active collaborative people' rather than'passive individual people', 'service participants' rather than 'service users' and recognise citizens as both 'people withneeds' and 'people as assets in meeting their own and each other's needs'. However, despite the growing interest in therole, objectives and impact of design in strategic public sector contexts, there is also an acknowledged gap inunderstanding design's contribution to such situations. This project is designed to address that gap. Two interrelated action research activities will be delivered in parallel. The first will deliver a citizen-centred exploration ofexactly how such collaboration plays out in specific service contexts. For the pilot we propose to take the reform of LondonBorough of Camden's Library Services as our starting point. The second will explore the models, mechanisms andmeasurement of impact of the 'Public Collaboration Lab', evaluating the model and its wider potential as a means ofdemocratizing social and service innovation and informing policy. The project aims to:  - Undertake a demonstrator social innovation project within a specially created 'public collaboration lab' to redesign publicservices through the application of collaborative design led approaches. - Increase understanding of HEI institutions' roles in supporting innovation practices within local government throughdesign led action research.  - Explore the potential for co-design to democratize public service reform and improve pubic outcomes.  - Co-design evaluative frameworks for assessing the role of design in local government service reform. - Propose means by which the pilot study could be upscaled within other contexts A process of examination and distillation will create a body of material which will serve as the basis for a series ofcoordinated outputs, including journal articles, conference papers, a research blog, case study material, service and socialinnovations, as well as a public collaboration lab model, framework and tools for HE/LG collaboration. The PCL team willwork closely with Nesta, Public Service Transformation Network, the international DESIS Network of over 40 DESIS labs,Impact Hub Network, Social Innovation Exchange, King's Cross Knowledge Quarter, Age UK and others to disseminateand maximise real-world impact of the project outputs. Dissemination will be integrated within the collaborativemethodology of the project, by involving relevant users, practitioners and policy makers in research, ideation andimplementation. To disseminate the findings, the project team will target major events and publications in the localgovernment, public policy, design research, and design HE communities. The final evaluation report will be designed in aforward-looking manner so that the lessons and opportunities arising from this pilot can be applied in other contexts.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN504282%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project looks at subject pronouns ('I', 'she', 'they') and how their form and functions change over time. Languages create new pronouns (neither 'she' nor 'they' are directly descended from Old English). The ways pronouns are used can vary: 'She and I both left' (with coordination of two pronouns) is fine in English but its literal translation is not possible in French. Hence, pronouns can change from one pattern to the other: French used to be more like English in this example, and it is usually thought that French pronouns have in some sense become 'weaker', leading to this change. Some languages allow pronouns to be omitted: 'I speak Italian' is 'Parlo italiano' in Italian, with no word corresponding to 'I' (the '-o' ending of 'parlo' indicates the subject). Whether a language can omit pronouns can change: French was once more like Italian in this respect and has become more like English. Even in Italian, pronouns are sometimes used. When a pronoun is appropriate depends on complex factors, for instance, to do with what is the current topic of discussion and when it was last mentioned. These rules too can change over time. The central question that this project aims to answer is how and why so much to do with subject pronouns is variable over time. We do this by looking in-depth at the history of subject pronouns in three language groups broadly speaking spanning northern Europe: Celtic (Welsh, Irish, Breton etc.), Slavonic (Russian, Polish, Bulgarian etc.) and Germanic (English, German, Dutch etc.). While Germanic is relatively well studied in this regard, work on Slavonic is less well-developed and many questions remain unanswered, and relevant work on Celtic is still in its infancy. We annotate historical texts from the history of these languages to establish what patterns were found in the past. We then try to explain the patterns and changes against the background of existing approaches, such as the idea that pronouns undergo a cycle of weakening and replacement or that omission of subjects is linked to the number of different forms a verb has or to aspects of a language's word order. In this way, we hope both to shed light on the histories of the languages under investigation and to address broader questions about how and why pronominal systems and language in general change over time.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV00347X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The People of 1381 will produce the most detailed and comprehensive interpretation to date of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, one of the most dramatic moments in English history. By creating a comprehensive database of the thousands of people and places caught up in the rising, the project will enable for the first time the development of a holistic overview of the revolt. This will shed light on the complex economic and social relations of the revolt and help us understand the role of violence and insurgency in pre-modern politics. The records of the revolt offer a remarkable opportunity to explore the lives, aspirations and frustrations of those usually hidden from view so that we can understand their political motivations and the way in which they viewed government and politics. The English 1381 Revolt forms part of a wider upsurge in European political unrest and revolt in the later middle ages. The People of 1381 by providing the first comprehensive analysis of the participants of a medieval European revolt will assist in understanding the nature and significance of insurgency in later medieval Europe more generally. The People of 1381 is a methodologically innovative project. Drawing on the exceptionally detailed archival records of the prosecutions arising from the 1381 revolt, we will create a database providing the first overview of events, places and people in the rising. By linking this to other databases, such as the Medieval Soldier database and records of the Poll Taxes, we will identify patterns of involvement in the rising. The creation of a database will enable us to explore in considerable detail such questions as: who was involved in the rising; what were the strategies and method of protest; and what motives, discourses and identities were articulated. The use of Geographic Information Systems will allow us to dynamically map the development and structure of the rising, so that we can identify differing community levels of protest and see how these fitted together into a revolt that threatened at one stage to topple the government. By exploring the textuality of the records generated by the rising, we will enhance understanding of the political and cultural impact of the revolt and the way it shaped popular polity and the political community. By recreating the biographies of thousands of people who became caught up in the rising of 1381 and by reconstructing the role of different places, we will offer a new type of 'history from below' for medieval studies. We will examine the lives of hundreds of people usually hidden from view and understand their political motivations and the way in which they related to government. Our emphasis on the importance of exploring the lives of forgotten social groups and people give our impact activities a particular relevance and vibrancy. We will use the people of 1381 to develop a new and exciting approach to the Middle Ages for those who might previously have believed this to be an inaccessible period of history. At the heart of the preoccupations of those involved in the rising of 1381 were ideas of community and how communities should be protected and nurtured. Correspondingly, we believe that the study of the rising of 1381 can help foster a modern sense of community and engagement with the past, and the impact activities associated with The People of 1381 will help foster such community histories.","The People of 1381 will make the lives of ordinary people in the Middle Ages accessible to a wide public audience. The project will, for the first time, reveal that the people who took part in the most important pre-modern English revolt are not lost to posterity, and that the issues at stake for them do still resonate with us today. We hope to enhance public debates on the historical context of perennial hot topics such as tax protests, governmental collection of data and regional autonomy. The two central groups of beneficiaries we will seek to engage will be local communities and educators, but other beneficiaries will include school aged children and genealogists.  1. Local communities: By working with local communities, we aim to foster the sense of local identity and heritage and engage people from a diverse range of backgrounds for whom medieval history might seem remote, irrelevant or simply unknown. The focus of the 1381 Rising provides a great opportunity to do this, with the involvement of minority groups and working class protest. This is not simply a history of remote, privileged elites. The speeches of the rebels who demanded social justice can be voiced by people for whom their concerns resonate today. As well as learning about 'history from below', the project will enable people in local communities to contribute to the project and make a difference to our research. This co-creation of the touring exhibition will give a sense of ownership of history, and remove the sense of distance that many feel when learning about their past.  2. Educators: Teachers from KS2 to KS5 need support to create resources and foster the teaching of medieval history at all stages in the history curriculum. Our project will demonstrate the relevance of the 1381 Rising to communities that find it hard to relate to medieval lives and provide subject-based training for their own CPD and to enhance teaching practice. The Teaching Fellowship Scheme, in collaboration with the Historical Association, will enable teachers to engage with the latest research into medieval history. This will demonstrate the relevance of individual lives in the Middle Ages to current life, exploring the larger issues of community, difference, acceptance and violence, therefore potentially impacting on other areas of the school curriculum.  3. Primary and secondary school age children: The pupils of the teachers involved in the Teaching Fellowship Scheme will directly benefit from the new resources and historical knowledge. However, in order to impact on a wider range of children the children's poetry competition on 1381, in collaboration with The Poetry Society, will encourage children to feel they can access lives from the remote past at an emotional level, and not just in the classroom. Children will be given the opportunity to engage with poets, develop new skills in poetry and creative writing, and will benefit from seeing that historical research can be relevant in the arts. 4. Genealogists: Genealogists are keen to find new resources that will help them with their research, and by collaborating with groups of genealogists we will open up these new resources. They will benefit from seeing how individual stories link to the bigger picture of the people of 1381. Legacy: The longer-term legacy of the project will be secured in two main ways: firstly with permanent displays at several of the venues visited by the travelling exhibition; secondly via online teaching materials, stories and audio-dramas made publicly available on our website and in conjunction with the Historical Association. Thus the project will permanently enhance the provision for access to people's history, both in the regions associated with the Revolt and in London.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS011765%2F1

"Funding details                                                                                                              This follow on funding project builds on an existing collaboration between Red Earth Theatre, a small-scale touring company with an established track record and commitment to research in inclusive integrated communication for young audiences (with a focus on deaf audiences) and an interdisciplinary team of researchers across arts and computer sciences at the University of Nottingham.  Red Earth's established 'total communication' approach to making theatre aims to integrate modes of communication - including metaphor, symbol, costume, set, lighting, auditory, signed, oral, written, and music - immersively within the theatrical aesthetics of the performance. British Sign Language and/or Sign Supported English has been successfully embedded within the action through the skilled work of their actors, but the challenge of achieving integrated embedded captions within the stage action to achieve immersiveness rather than the attention splitting caused by the placement of captions whether at the side, above or via phone screens (as with Talking Birds' The Difference Engine) or smart glasses (National Theatre) is expensive and demanding for small- and medium-scale theatre companies.  Through a series of iterative workshops and events with key stakeholders from the deaf community and the seven theatre companies that make up the Arts Council funded Ramps on the Moon network, funded by the AHRC/EPSRC's 2018 Research and Partnership Development call - Next Generation of Immersive Experiences, our team has worked to explore the potential for the use of cheap or freely available immersive technologies - using virtual reality tracking and projection - to support further development of integrated inclusiveness for deaf audiences in small scale touring productions. Having successfully developed, trialled and shared prototype approaches in short extracts of performance, we now seek to embed our suggested solutions in the context of a full touring production. This will enable the integration of our immersive captions as a full element of the performance and production from the beginning of the design process, in contrast to the existing practice of captioning that is added at the end of the production process and situated above or to the side of the stage. In autumn 2019, Red Earth will tour Soonchild, based on Russell Hoban's book and incorporating specially commissioned music from the folk ensemble Threaded. Set in the frozen North, Soonchild tells the story of the shaman Sixteen Face John as he undertakes an epic journey to capture the world's songs for his unborn child, who cannot be born until the songs have been found. This production, aimed at children aged 8+ and their families, will enable us to showcase the technologies in action, creatively embedding our previous research with the aim of: - sharing the potential of this innovative technology with audiences. Red Earth planned tour of a minimum of 15 performances in the autumn of 2019 will reach an anticipated audience of up to 1000 young children and family members (the show will be revived in 2020 touring to a planned minimum of 20 medium sized-venues). Feedback from audience members will inform future marketing and information on the system to support venues seeking to engage with often hard to reach audiences in the D/deaf community, ensuring that our integrated immersive inclusive technology has maximum impact with theatre audiences. - proving the stability and robustness of the system, which will be showcased to new communities of theatre venues and production companies via a hands-on technical workshop and supported via specially created video tutorials and how to guides. On completion of the Soonchild tour, the equipment used will be made available for loan to other companies who wish to trial the technologies, ensuring effective and supported pathways to impact for prospective new users of our integrated immersive incusive technology.","While this project continues to sustain the pathways to impact envisaged in the original 'Integrated Immersive Inclusiveness project, supporting Red Earth's capacity to deliver on the potential benefits of our prototype technology, our aim is to build new impact outcomes with a significant change in scale through activities centred on a full production of Soonchild which will creatively demonstrate the potential of our aesthetically embedded captioning technology to new audiences and user communities, as follows: 1. up to 1,000 audience members (children aged 8+ and their families) will experience integrated immersive captioning for the first time in the touring show that this project will enable, made feasible by our development of a stable, user friendly, low equipment cost, open source projection mapping system. Follow on funding takes this technology from the laboratory to the stage of venues around the country, where audiences on the spectrum of hearing loss from D/deaf to hard of hearing will benefit for the first time. Success will be measured by capture of audience feedback, and planned integration of the technology into subsequent Red Earth tours. 2. small scale theatre companies across the UK and beyond will benefit from access to that projection mapping system, supported by a set of best practice guidelines for delivering embedded captions, training materials for how to use the technology and how to embed it in a production process, and a focussed workshop/tutorial to disseminate the system, guidelines and knowledge. Both workshop and the availability of materials will be publicised by Ramps on the Moon and the Independent Theatre Council (ITC), and through publication channels such as Arts Professional and The Stage, ensuring maximum reach and impact. Availability of a physical, borrowable system that can be used by other production companies wishing to try out the system before committing to purchasing the necessary equipment makes the trialling of the technology by other small companies feasible and will ensure sustainability of the project beyond the funding period. 3. Red Earth's 'D/deaf Like Me' report, carried out with support from an AHRC Midlands3Cities DTP placement student in 2017, highlighted that 'the major stumbling block to participation of D/deaf people in theatre is communication access - at every stage of the process ... Information in an accessible form to those who need it, via multiple channels - the right language and the right medium' is vital. Through this project, venues across the UK will benefit from work led by CoI Mevel and the Inclusive Engagement Fellow that will develop best practice guidance and examples for marketing materials to ensure that audiences understand what the production will offer. Support for venues to develop sustainable relationships with audiences from the deaf community, many of whom currently fall within the hard to engage category, will be of direct benefit to the individual venues visited on tour, and for other venues visited by Red Earth and other inclusive theatre companies on subsequent tours beyond the funding period.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS010599%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will build on work undertaken from 2016-2020 as part of the AHRC-funded 'Prehistoric Grave Goods' project (PGGP). PGGP brought together diverse information about objects from burials to reveal fascinating details about some of the most alluring and intriguing objects found in prehistoric Britain. One key element of the original project was to build on identified public interest, raising awareness of and providing new, accessible information about prehistoric grave goods in the British Museum and - via information packs - in primary schools across the UK. Another important strand was to ensure that, having used information from existing, publicly accessible digital holdings (HERs) as a starting point for our research, detailed findings from the project were fed directly back into these repositories so that they could provide a sound platform for future investigations of prehistoric burial. The proposed Boundary Objects project (BOP) aims to build on this work, developing it in new directions according to recognised needs. Over the course of PGGP, we became acutely aware of how difficult it can be to access information about grave goods, and the extent to which different parcels of information exist in different, unconnected silos - there is a chronic lack of joined-up thinking across the heritage sector regarding archaeological objects (finds) and their contexts of discovery (sites). We also came to realise that, despite a very clear public interest in prehistoric grave goods and the stories they have to tell, very few opportunities currently exist for volunteers to contribute meaningfully to finds research, whether in national- or regional-level institutions. In order to respond to these parallel gaps/needs, BOP aims to: (1) use grave goods to inspire a new wave of archaeological volunteers in both national and key regional institutions, and (2) enable people to access information about archaeological finds/sites, currently located in diverse and often relatively inaccessible locations, through one coherent, centralised portal: a 'finds hub'.  In order to achieve these goals, we will: hold a series of stakeholder workshops in Edinburgh, Orkney and the Outer Hebrides; engage volunteers in new and meaningful finds-related research (populating the 'finds hub', connecting museum finds back up with their sites of origin, co-creating a series of 'grave good stories' which will be published as Canmore 'long reads' and form part of our end-of-project celebration exhibition and creating new 3D digital models of finds); work with leading industry players to develop an effective and sustainable 'finds hub' that will connect disparate archaeological information in one location; and produce two best-practice documents that will concretize the project's legacy and, we hope, ensure uptake of its ideas across the UK heritage sector. Whilst PGGP covered Britain as a whole, Scotland has been selected as the pilot area for BOP because of the coherency and accessibility of its digital repositories (Canmore and NMS) and because of our project partners' enthusiasm to participate. The core project team will include members of the original PGGP together with colleagues at Historic Environment Scotland (HES) and the National Museum of Scotland (NMS). Wider stakeholders include Historic Environment Record and museum professionals from two case study areas - Orkney and the Outer Hebrides - and volunteer groups associated with these organisations. In producing a sustainable 'finds hub' resource that, in principle, can be rolled out across the UK, inviting UK-wide heritage professionals to our end-of-project workshops and producing two widely-available best practice documents, we hope to ensure a nationwide, scalable legacy for the project.","The Boundary Objects project (BOP) aims to enhance significantly the impact of the original AHRC-funded Prehistoric Grave Goods project (PGGP), ensuring that the latter has impact on new audiences and benefits the wider heritage sector in new ways. Our key aims are (1) to inspire a new wave of archaeological volunteers, and (2) to enable people to access information about archaeological finds/sites, currently located in diverse silos, using one coherent, centralised portal. In order to achieve these goals, we will hold a series of stakeholder workshops, engage volunteers in new finds-related research, co-create a series of 'grave goods stories' for public dissemination, and produce two best-practice documents that will concretize the project's legacy and, we hope, ensure uptake of its ideas across the UK heritage sector.  Several groups of people will benefit from the project: 1. Existing and potential volunteers, community groups and members of the public who have an interest in archaeology and would like to 'get involved' Consultation with our project partner institutions and other interested stakeholders has identified a lack of opportunities for members of the public to undertake voluntary work relating to Scottish archaeological finds. In providing (a) new impetus for both national and regional heritage organisations to encourage volunteering, and (b) a specific set of meaningful and engaging tasks for volunteers to undertake in the first instance (including population of the new 'finds hub', research for our 'grave goods stories' and 3D modelling of finds), BOP will ensure multiple new opportunities for people to get involved. This will not only provide volunteers with personal satisfaction, but potentially also important transferable skills and access to a community of other like-minded people.  2. Historic Environment Record officers (HEROs), local museum curators and other heritage professionals  Heritage professionals - especially those located in our case study areas (Outer Hebrides and Orkney) - will benefit from the project's creation of a diverse range of new volunteering opportunities, both immediately (in relation to this project) and in the future. This will, we hope, lead to new ways of working with local communities in future, enhancing collections/repositories, improving heritage resources (e.g. information available in HERs) more widely and ensuring a sustainable platform on which further volunteering can be undertaken.  3. The National Museum of Scotland and Historic Environment Scotland  Our highly motivated project partners will make important gains from the project. Both organisations will benefit from the expansion and upskilling of existing volunteers, from increased usage of their currently underused (yet meticulously maintained) online resources, and from the creation of images and textual information about previously inaccessible materials for various display/outreach purposes. By developing the 'finds hub' and taking forwards volunteer opportunities for involvement in the project, both NMS and HES will become recognised across the UK heritage sector as leaders in developing a joined-up and open approach to object-centred research. This will put them in a prime position to advise upon the future enhancement of existing efforts to improve the flow of information in UK archaeology.  4. A range of other potential stakeholders across the UK In order to ensure that this project has wide impact, we will invite practitioners from across the UK to our end-of-project workshops and create 'best practice' documents relating to volunteering and joined-up finds information. Additionally, in creating a 'finds hub' model - in collaboration with key players in the industry - that can be rolled out much more widely, the project will have potential to impact heritage practice and data creation across the UK in the long-term.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT012145%2F1

This form of collective ""melée"" typically took place in the countryside across an area of several square miles, with hundreds of knights and squires, grouped into two teams, performing mock battles against each other. From the 13th century onwards, however, the tournament was gradually superseded by a more individualised form of combat: the joust. More often taking place in towns than the countryside, the joust served chiefly to showcase the knight's individual acts of chivalric prowess in the field.  The most elaborate type of joust was known as the ""pas d'armes"" (passage of arms). These costly and elite stagings involved a knight, often adopting a fictional persona drawn from historical or literary models, who issued a challenge to all comers of suitably noble birth who wished to fight him using lances, swords, or axes. Originating in Iberia but popular mainly among the nobility of France, Anjou and Burgundy, the ""pas d'armes"" would take place over an extended period of days, weeks, or even months. Sponsored by a wealthy nobleman, they were attended by participants belonging to the social elite from all over Europe, officiated by a high-ranking lord or his chief herald, and watched by mixed audiences in terms of gender and social milieu. The ""pas d'armes"" were described in detailed specifications known as ""chapitres"", while judgements on the various encounters were recorded by heralds for posterity, along with descriptions of the many banquets and dramatic interludes (""entremets"") that formed an essential part of the entertainments post-combat. Many accounts of the ""pas d'armes"" circulated independently or were incorporated into other works such as tournament book collections and armorials and in historiographical narratives such as chivalric biographies and chronicles, sometimes with lavish illumination cycles. As a major contributor to the formation and dissemination of chivalric culture and values from the 15th-16th centuries, the ""pas d'armes"" could help mediate social relations between different groups wielding power in the polity; its complex staging and symbolism could also be an expression of aspiration and encouragement to crusade. The ""pas d'armes"" has long been known to medieval specialists but has attracted little attention other than from historians and literary scholars interested in tracing the evolution of tournaments and jousting. Yet the ""pas d'armes"" was not just a sporting event: it was also a political, social, cultural and artistic performance and a multi-media spectacle. For these reasons, it demands to be re-assessed from a cross-disciplinary perspective by scholars from a range of different backgrounds. The proposed research network thus brings together an international group comprising historians (cultural, social, political and material), art historians, literary and performance scholars, some of whom are also professionals from museums of arts and armour, or who have collaborated with colleagues in such museums. Its chief aim is to stimulate a scholarly dialogue among specialists that will cross disciplinary boundaries and shed new light on this important aspect of late medieval chivalric culture in all its myriad dimensions, including physical training for warfare, pre- and post-combat rituals and symbolism, spectatorship, gender identity formation, financing and political significance, collective memory formation, etc. The group's findings will be of interest to academic audiences in a range of different fields (literature, history, gender studies, performance/theatre studies, art history), to museum professionals working with arms and armour and in the culture and heritage industries more broadly, as well as, potentially, to school teachers and members of the general public interested in chivalry.","The main activities of the proposed research network as outlined here in the Summary, Objectives, and Case for Support, are two workshops and a programme of public engagement events. These activities will lead to the production of a substantial body of innovative, cross-disciplinary work on the ""pas d'armes"" that will be disseminated to a range of different audiences through its various outputs.  The COLLECTED VOLUME OF ESSAYS arising from the presentation of research papers at the network's workshops will be of benefit chiefly to specialist scholars and students working in a wide range of academic disciplines (history, literature, art history, gender studies, material culture, theatre/performance).  The ONLINE DATABASE to be hosted by the website created by the group will feature: - a contextualising essay on the place of the ""pas d'armes"" in the evolution of tournaments and jousting - a definitive list of historical events that can be classified as ""pas d'armes"" - an authoritative bibliography of both primary and secondary sources relating to study of the ""pas d'armes"" - blogs and podcasts delivered by members of the research network on aspects of chivalric culture arising from our research; these could feature dialogues between two or more members of the network so as to convey the multi- and cross-disciplinary nature of the group's work - English translations of ""pas d'armes"" narrative sources - links to external archival sources, such as repositories of textiles relating to jousts, digital reproductions of images from manuscripts featuring ""pas d'armes"" in both historical and literary narrative sources, banqueting resources relating to musical performance, tapestries, and food, etc.  The beneficiaries of these research and teaching resources that are not ordinarily easily accessed by audiences outside academia will include specialist scholars and university students, museum professionals and also, potentially, school teachers and members of the general public interested in chivalry as a source of information about medieval life and culture.  The programme of PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT EVENTS will be organised under the aegis of the International Medieval Congress at Leeds in July 2021 and 2022 and will consist of:  - two round table sessions on the ""pas d'armes"", one from the point of view of exhibiting artefacts relating to jousts and the other on staging re-enactments of jousts that would take account of the multiple dimensions of such events that the group has identified in its work - two public lectures on selected aspects of the ""pas d'armes"" and jousting that would be delivered as part of the IMC's outreach activities, at the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds.  The main beneficiaries of the network's proposed public engagement activities are museum professionals and others working in the culture industries who will gain not only a better understanding of the multi-modal nature of these events that were at once displays of martial valour, affirmations of chivalric and gendered identity, artistic performances, and expressions of political power, but also a greater appreciation of the multiple actors in their various roles who contributed to its staging and commemoration. In more concrete terms, professionals working in museums of arms and armour will be able to supplement their own displays of tournament artefacts with written sources from both historical texts commemorating these events and fictional narratives that were inspired by them, archival sources documenting how they were financed, images from illuminated manuscripts, images of clothing worn prior to, during, and after the combats, aspects of feasting, etc, that all constituted an essential part of a ""pas d'armes"". This would help to give a greater degree of contextualisation and complexity to the usual exhibitions of jousting artefacts and re-enactments that are featured at such museums.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT005777%2F1

The original large project ""Gender, Caste and the Practices of Religious Identities (Project reference: AH/F009143/1, PI: Navtej Purewal) completed in 2010, was funded under the Religion and Society programme. While there were a number of academic and creative outputs from that project, the impacts and engagement activities were mainly focused in South Asia.  This proposal aims to extend the findings and contributions of the original project to audiences in the UK, particularly the South Asian diaspora. Through a study of religious practices in contemporary Punjab, the 2010 project emphasised the need to complicate historically embedded logics of religious difference. Such logics are heavily grounded in memories and public narratives of the partition of 1947 and developed new approaches for understanding the mechanisms through which rigid ideas and categories of religious, and national, identity are constantly being asserted and reconstructed. The current project draws on these insights and methodologies to examine how memories and public narratives of the partition of 1947 have developed and changed over time amongst the UK diaspora. This follow-on project will also explore how new developments in Virtual Reality (VR) technology can be used to contribute further insight to the 2010 project's claim that thinking across bordered ideas of identity can enable critical re-examinations of the past. The partnership with Project Dastaan enables the research team to explore how immersive VR experience can be used to disseminate the critical methodological findings of the 2010 project while also helping to extend and expand the ways in which the partition, as a significant theme of cultural heritage for South Asian diaspora communities in the UK, is commemorated, remembered and memorialised.  The project has four key objectives: 1. To reflect on and encourage dialogue about changes in the ways in which partition has been commemorated, remembered and memorialised in both South Asia and the UK in the decades before the 75th anniversary of independence and to better understand the flows and processes that connect memorialising across these two locations/spaces. 2. To work with stakeholder communities to share knowledge of how understandings of partition vary across communities and generations in the South Asian UK diaspora, and wider British society. 3. To explore how VR and visual media can be used to facilitate new cross-generational and cross-community conversations about partition, independence and their legacy. 4. To produce learning resources that can enable more critical and inclusive teaching about 1947 and its legacies in South Asia and the UK.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX000184%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              In 2015, a group of girls set up a Twitter account as part of their secondary school feminist society. Less than an hour after posting their first tweet, they received a barrage of angry, sexualized responses. Over the coming weeks, they were attacked, threatened, and belittled. The girls were told to 'kill themselves', called 'Feminazis,' sent porn links, had official statistics on sexual violence challenged, told to 'shut up' and 'make me a sandwich.'  Since 2014, we have been studying young people's use of digital technologies to challenge gender inequality, sexism and harassment (Mendes et al. 2019). While digital technologies offer new possibilities for change, they make those who speak out vulnerable to vicious, often gendered, sexualized and racialized trolling. Our research shows that while some pupils possess necessary personal resilience and digital literacy skills to cope with these challenges, many do not and end up feeling silenced, politically disengaged, or traumatized.  Drawn from broader challenges of keeping young people safe online, combating disinformation, developing pathways to resilience, and fostering opportunities for political engagement identified through our research, this follow-on project has three key aims:  First, we will develop seven bespoke Digital Defence & Digital Activism (DD&A) workshops for secondary-students (Key Stages 3-5). The first three Digital Defence sessions will cover general topics such as how to identify disinformation and fake news in a 'post-truth' world (Marwick & Lewis 2017), developing online safety strategies, image sharing and the law, and managing mental and physical health. The final four Digital Activism workshops will teach young people to harness digital technologies for political activism. We focus on feminist activism because it allows us to draw on findings from our original AHRC award, and because there is a need for feminist education, training and political engagement (Ringrose 2012).  Second, we will develop workshops and guidance for teachers on how to link our DD&A workshops to the newly mandatory Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) curriculum.  Third, we will develop open-access resources such as handbooks, podcasts, worksheets and videos from social media influencers. These digitized resources, hosted by Leicester University's Figshare repository for a 10-year-minimum will maximize the workshops' reach to new (inter)national audiences, enabling their sustainability beyond the funding period.  While our original AHRC award focused specifically on challenges and opportunities of digital feminist activism, scholars have documented vicious trolling towards others who dare to 'talk back' (hooks 1989) to oppression, including campaigners on LGBTQ+ issues, and those fighting for racial equality online (Scheurman et al. 2018). As a result, safety strategies employed by our participants have broad applicability to all activists, or anyone who wishes to express their views via digital technologies. Working with key stakeholders and collaborators, this project will have immediate impact with 2.3k secondary students who will gain specific understanding of gender and sexual inequalities; laws around image sharing; improved pathways to resilience and digital literacy skills. Longer term impact will include increased and more effective civic engagement; a reduction in criminal offences and prosecution of image-based crimes (revenge porn, upskirting); a generation better equipped to identify and combat disinformation; and decreased levels of stress, anxiety and depression. The project will also immediately impact 2.5k teachers who will be able to deliver effective and relevant RSE lessons. In the long term, it will develop teachers who are more confident addressing 'the digital' in young people's lives.  Through digitizing our resources, the project has the potential to reach hundreds of thousands of people in years to come.","This project emerges at a time when online sexual violence, fake news and young people's mental health are identified as pressing social and political issues. Our AHRC funded research demonstrates both highly sophisticated 'digital defence' and activist strategies some participants use to cope, mitigate, avert, and fight back against these challenges. This new project will impact: (a) Young People, who will benefit from increased digital literacy skills, identifying fake news and disinformation, the law and image sharing. They will develop pathways to resilience, including how to block and report harmful, offensive or illegal content and how to become politically engaged via digital technologies. Our workshops will reach 2.3k secondary school pupils across England (77 workshops x 30 participants). News of our workshops however will reach 600k+ through content created by social media influencers Hannah Witton and Calum McSwiggan. We will measure impact through surveys immediately before and after each workshop to monitor learning, and another survey one month on to capture changes in beliefs, practices and actions.  (b) Schools and Teachers will benefit from having long-lasting, digitized, evidence based materials to teach RSE lessons, and a better understanding of contemporary issues faced by young people online. Our teacher training workshops will directly reach 2.5k teachers across the UK in schools (30 workshops x 30 teachers), via PGCE programs (125 students x 2), a workshop hosted at UCL (50 teachers), and through ASCL conferences (1.3k teachers). News of these workshops will reach 19k+ through direct communication with ASCL's members. Impact with teachers will be measured in the same way as with students, via a series of surveys.  (c) Sexplain will benefit through a fundamental reorientation of their strategic direction, focus, content and materials. Sexplain will grow as an organization, becoming (inter)national experts in RSE delivery. Sexplain is committed to training other organizations how to use our workshops, thus increasing their reach and sustainability. Impact will be measured through monitoring access to our resources hosted on Figshare and embedded on Sexplain's website. We will track mentions of all materials by stakeholders such as academics, government bodies, third-sector workers, and activist groups via DOIs.  (d) Educational Associations and Bodies such as the ASCL will benefit by promoting cutting edge research and interventions into pressing issues - such as rising levels of mental disorders, increased levels of (online) sexual violence, and new RSE requirements. We will build relationships with other organizations such as Teach First, and UK Safer Internet Centre. (e) Society as a whole will benefit as young people become more civically engaged, politically aware, and feel safer navigating digital landscapes. We may witness decreased stress levels, anxiety, and depression, as society develops better coping strategies to combat trolling and online harassment. Increased awareness of laws around online image sharing may lead to a reduction of criminal offences or prosecutions, measured through government crime statistics, the Internet Watch Foundation or Revenge Porn Helpline.  Sustainability: Sexplain will deliver, refine and build upon all workshops beyond the funding period. All materials will be digitized and stored on easily updated file formats to reflect likely social, technological or regulatory changes over time and space. Podcasts and videos will focus on broad and pervasive issues such as trolling, harassment and mental health to ensure a longer lifespan. Sexplain and the ASCL will promote all workshops and materials to their networks of charities, associations, schools and councils (e.g. GirlGuiding UK, the Sex Education Forum). There is significant potential to promote our workshops beyond England where governments are revisiting sex education in schools.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT008938%2F1

Despite strict EU regulations and control programmes, a substantial part of British e-waste is exported to developing countries, where it is often recycled through environmentally harmful methods or dumped in unprotected areas, causing severe environmental damage accompanied by a range of socio-cultural problems. Despite this, public debate on digital technologies in Britain and other post-industrial countries has been primarily focused on the economic and social benefits of technological innovation. Digital performance arts practices have largely been complicit in this narrative. On the one hand, their primary interest has been in the exploration and showcasing of state of the art innovations; on the other, critical practices in the field have been restricted to the politics of a western, post-industrial cultural framework. Digital performance arts practitioners have rarely engaged with the material and socio-economic aspects of technology in terms of their production, and their 'afterlife' as electronic waste.  Bodies of Planned Obsolescence is a one-year international research networking project in which performance artists, art curators, scientists and cultural theorists will exchange and develop performance-based approaches to digital arts and the cultural and environmental aspects of the global economy of electronic waste. By re-functioning e-waste materials, digital arts practices will make the economic and ecological issues visible. By interaction with colleagues from other disciplines, the artists' impact will be augmented by scientific and socio-economic findings. The network overall will develop innovative international research collaborations with researchers from the UK as a country that exports a substantial part of its e-waste, and two countries that import e-waste: Nigeria and China.  This project will include the following key elements: -Launch event at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London -Workshop & symposium in Hong Kong and Guiyu, China, combining paper and performance presentations with participation in labour processes at an e-waste recycling facility. -Workshop & symposium in Lagos Nigeria, including practice-based explorations of e-waste dumping sites. -Public conference/arts event at Watermans Art Centre in London, UK, which combines academic presentations with the creation of new performance work with electronic waste re-imported from Nigeria. The focus on digital performance practices in Bodies of Planned Obsolescence is driven by the notion that critical practices in performance arts can constitute an intervention in broader cultural performative practices around understandings of - and engagement with - technology. An innovative aspect of Bodies of Planned Obsolescence is its methodological approach to practice-based research, which builds on anthropologist Tim Ingold's insight that not only art, but also anthropology, archaeology, and architecture should be practiced as 'thinking through making', instead of a focus on theorizing an externalized world.. Bodies of Planned Obsolescence seeks to extend Ingold's approach into collaborative work in the field of science and arts. Thus, practice-based research in digital performance arts is not only conceived as building on - and responding to - academic and scientific theory, as is often the case in science-arts collaborations, but also constitutes a process of 'blue-sky' experimentation, which may play an initiating role in discourse and research in other disciplines, as well as establish alternate modes of dissemination of scientific and humanities research on e-waste outside academia.","Key impact areas: 1) Arts Practitioners Collaborations with leading arts organizations will open the different events of the network to broader local audiences of professional artists. A collaboration with the Victoria & Albert Museum Digital Programmes department has been agreed, which will involve the inclusion of project activities in the V&A Digital Design Weekend. This is one of the UK's leading networking platforms for digital artists, which also reaches a broad audience of the general public (see below). In Nigeria, a collaboration with the Lagos Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) will facilitate involvement of the Lagos performance and new media art community, whilst an outreach to the professional artist community in Hong Kong is currently being discussed with the Hong Kong Performance Art Project of the Asian Art Archive. The Principal Investigator, Dr Daniël Ploeger, will bring to the network a number of internationally recognized performance artists who have worked extensively in a science-art context. The participating artists - in addition to the project website and public media channels (see below) - will be important liaisons for further dissemination of the project's outcomes and activities in arts communities outside academia. 2) General Audience The network's public event in London, as well as part of the workshops in Lagos and Guiyu/Hong Kong will take place at venues open to the general public that already draw a broad audience. All events will be free of charge. The project's events and its outcomes will also be brought to the attention of the general public through the following channels: -Participant Irini Papadimitriou, Digital Programmes Manager at the V&A Museum and Head of New Media Arts Development at the Watermans Art Centre, London, will include UK-based activities in the programmes of both the V&A Museum and the Watermans Art Centre.  -The CI is active in educational projects around waste and ecology in Hong Kong and is a chartered member of the YMCA youth organization. In these roles, she will integrate the project's themes, methodologies and outcomes into learning activities for secondary school students. -The Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) is Lagos' main contemporary arts venue with a broad and loyal audience from the general public. The centre will integrate the project into their public programme. -The project website will play a central role in the dissemination of information about project activities. In addition, the site will constitute a publicly accessible archive, which will remain available after the project's completion. 3) Policy Makers The network is also aimed at disseminating its processes and outcomes to policy makers, and the inclusion of policy makers and lobbying groups in the public elements of the network's activities in the three countries. Connections to various bodies affiliated with environmental policy making have been established and will be further developed, building on network members' existing affiliations: The CI is a member of the Environmental Management Association of Hong Kong, participant Prof Oladele Osibanjo is a leading expert in the global trade of e-waste and a key person in the Secretariat of the Basel Convention the world's most important policy making body concerned with e-waste. 4) Media impact Peter Dammann, a World Press Photo award winning photographer with extensive experience in the documentation of the social dimensions of cultural and industrial activity in developing countries, has generously agreed to document the project on the basis of reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses. Dammann has important connections to relevant journalists in the field of international development who are interested to write about the project. The network's activities and outcomes will also be disseminated to the press through the PR offices of the Watermans Art Centre, and the Centre for Contemporary Arts Lagos.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL01582X%2F1

Members of the team have extensive experience of community heritage projects and public engagement activities, and the aim of this project is to bring the expertise located within UCL to the attention of a wider audience, to deepen existing and establish new partnerships with community groups, explore the benefits of bringing together different branches of community heritage activities and seek to encourage the participation of young people in community heritage activities. Drawing inspiration from the History Workshop slogan ""Dig Where You Stand"", this project is based on the principle that a community's sense of place and identity partly rests on its understanding of its past. Building on existing initiatives and work in community archaeology, community archives, local history, cultural heritage, oral history, public geography, community film and media studies and digital heritage, the researchers in this team all share a belief in the profound impact that engaging with history and local heritage can have in sustaining communities and enhancing the quality of life and well-being of those who participate in heritage activities. We are committed to sharing our knowledge and expertise to develop and sustain broad participation (particularly amongst young people) in a range of community heritage activities. The opportunity to work with various HLF funded projects from across London (and further afield) offers the chance to work and exchange knowledge with various communities on many different subjects with many different inspirations and desired outcomes. The project also gives researchers in UCL the opportunity to work together across departmental and disciplinary backgrounds. This project seeks to make clear the benefits for heritage practitioners and researchers of closer collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches by organising a project team and programme of events designed to stimulate dialogue, the mutual exchange of ideas and knowledge, and build future collaborations between different academic disciplines and between academic research and community research. Ultimately the project should increase the recognition of the community heritage expertise available within UCL and result in some exciting and innovative research activities and outcomes by HLF funded community groups and some sustainable longer term partnerships between academics and community heritage groups. This process and the learning which flows from it will be documented in conference papers at the appropriate community heritage conferences, an article on community heritage collaborations in a peer review journal (the International Journal of Heritage Studies) and practical guidance designed in collaboration with our community partners on strategies for encouraging young people to participate in heritage activity.","Who will benefit from this research project? a) Academics in UCL and elsewhere (see academic beneficiaries) b) Heritage professionals in museums, archives and archaeological societies who will have access to more information about community heritage activities and engaging with community groups, particularly young people with heritage activity. c) Schools, universities and other organisations working with young people in a framework where they might wish to introduce those young people to heritage activities d) Community groups, especially community groups already actively participating (or thinking of doing so) in local or community heritage work e) Society in general How will they benefit from this research project? This project is all about the exchange of knowledge with community heritage groups and other groups and individuals interested in getting involved in or supporting community heritage activity. It starts from a recognition that although great knowledge and expertise already resides in community heritage practitioner groups, great (and often different) knowledge also resides within higher education institutions like UCL. This project seeks to bring together some of that knowledge and expertise from across the disciplines at UCL in order to make it available to those wishing to get involved or are already involved in community activity. This knowledge can be used to address serious problems for the sustainability of community heritage (eg digital preservation) or to develop new practices / approaches (eg community archaeology or digital approaches to creating and sharing community heritage). In some cases this may result in sustained collaborative relationships between the university and community groups. The public events, individual knowledge exchange, online resources and longer term research partnerships should all result in more sustained, rigorous and ultimately more useful and widely accessible community heritage materials. The events, websites and community engagement models (especially those developed with regard to engaging young people) will be available to all other institutions (schools, museums, archives, social and welfare agencies) who wish to engage with community heritage, and this should again the support the creation of more successful and impactful community heritage projects and collaborations. In broader terms the members of this project and their partners believe that community heritage and participation in community heritage can have significant impacts on individuals, communities and society in general particularly in terms of culture, understanding and belonging, health and well-being but also in concrete terms of things like employability and the acquisition of useful skills and experience. Community heritage covers a wide range of activities and a wide range of 'communities', ranging from those with a local history focus to those with a focus on a history and heritage organised around an minority or ethnic identity. These different interests and communities will result in different possible impacts, and the HLF funded groups this project is working with reflect some of this huge diversity. However what is true of all these activities, is the more developed and sustainable they are, they better known they are, the more they can approach their heritage work in an innovative and holistic way through the collaborations with university researchers embedded in this project, then the larger, the more widespread and the more significant their impact is likely to be. This project aims to help community heritage activities achieve those impacts.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007645%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Groups that experience the worst health outcomes include people in coastal communities (like in the North East and North Cumbria), experiencing homelessness, dependent on drugs or alcohol, vulnerable migrants, people in contact with the justice system and other socially excluded groups. In the North East, 32% of people live in the most deprived 20% of the national population. The recent Levelling up White paper (2022), the White paper on health and social care integration (2022) and the NHS's Core20PLUS5 framework (2022) all highlight the role of housing as a key determinant of health.  This consortium will investigate and co-produce integrated, community led, asset-based approaches to supporting people with multiple and complex needs who have been homeless, to improve individual and community wellbeing and address health disparities in the North East North Cumbria Integrated Care System (NENC ICS).  The project will: (1) Provide training for and work closely with a group of Experts by Experience (who have been homeless), who will support evidence development and decision making into practice, policy and research in this area. They will: share their experiences and views on how services might best support people with multiple and complex needs; make use of an 'innovation budget' to improve a service and evaluate their innovations; help with mapping existing services. They will be an integral part of the project, leading many aspects of it. (2) Identify all the research evidence in the area of community support for people who experience homelessness, and identify the data being held by relevant stakeholders (local authorities, health services, voluntary sector) and how it might be shared to gain a better understanding of regional needs and monitor progress. (3) Identify one integrated care service (integrating, health, social care and housing), which will be improved and evaluated by experts by experience. (4) Identify and map all local community assets and services supporting people with multiple and complex needs, particularly in relation to housing, in the NENC. The mapping will create a directory of all services, statutory or otherwise, which community members can access for support. This will form the basis of a digital dynamic data sharing platform accessed by all relevant stakeholders, which will become a virtual consortium, directly connecting research on community assets with health and social care integration efforts, and community members, to reduce health disparities.  For this bid we have brought together an interdisciplinary team of experts across academia (covering expertise in housing; health inequalities; humanities; health economics; mental health; addictions; participatory research), service (housing; NHS) and policy (ICS) partners. The project is supported by Tyne Housing, a third sector organisation working with people experiencing precarious housing and homelessness; the NIHR NENC Applied Research Collaboration (a a partnership bringing together six regional universities, the NHS, health and social care providers, local authorities, the voluntary sector, community groups and members of the public); and the NENC Deep End network (a network of GP surgeries working in the most deprived areas regionally).",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX005836%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Late Neolithic period represents a key stage in our human history sitting as it does on the threshold between the Stone Age and Bronze Age. At this time a suite of cultural and ideological changes swept through Britain, including the introduction of the first metalwork. These cultural developments also involved the rapid construction of enormous ceremonial monuments, indicating a period of intense religiosity. Nowhere in the British Isles is this more evident today than within the Wessex landscape, with the construction of the major monuments at Avebury, Stonehenge and Silbury Hill. This project will take a new perspective on understanding the prehistoric landscape of the Wessex region, pioneering a holistic approach that uses connectivity and mobility as central themes, challenging archaeology's traditional focus upon place (Leary 2014; Kador & Leary in prep). The project will consider Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age monuments as nodes in a ceremonial and pilgrimage nexus. It will focus on the sacred importance of water and the use of rivers as route-ways linking ritual and ceremonial architecture. It appraises these monuments as interrelated through their connections to the river, representing a linked chain of cult centres that people journeyed to, and therefore takes the river valley and associated monuments as a single entity for study. This contrasts with the dominant views of the area that focus on just Stonehenge (for example Darvill and Wainwright 2009) or the interaction and duality between Stonehenge and Durrington Walls (such as Parker Pearson and Ramilisonina 1998 or Parker Pearson 2012), and moves interpretation on from discussions of centralised social polities and fixed notions of power. The project, led by the University of Reading in collaboration with the Wiltshire Museum and English Heritage, will examine the internationally important prehistoric landscape between Avebury and Stonehenge, linking for the first time the spatially separate components of the same World Heritage Site. The work will focus on the upper reaches of the River Avon in the Vale of Pewsey where recent aerial photographic work has mapped a plethora of prehistoric monuments and ceremonial sites. These include Marden henge - a large Neolithic complex with extraordinary internal features, including a now demolished huge mound, an internal henge, and a unique recently discovered Neolithic ritual building with associated evidence of feasting. The project will take place over three fieldwork seasons (2015 to 2017), followed by a full programme of analysis, archiving and publication (2018 to 2019). It will comprise investigations on various nested scales. These will include detailed, targeted, open area excavations aimed at understanding activities undertaken within and between the monuments, and a programme of test pitting to discern linkages between them and the River Avon. A programme of coring, test pitting and fieldwalking along the river and in the wider landscape will investigate the environmental history of the Vale, testing hypotheses of natural and human environmental disturbance in areas where monument complexes developed. The project will form part of the University of Reading's field school, a credit-bearing undergraduate module; the running and infrastructure for which will be funded separately by the University. Summary assessment reports will be produced at the end of each season and the Integrated Archaeological Database will be made available via the project website. The major academic output for the project will be a substantial monograph. A synthesis of the work will be published in the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society. Other outputs will include regular updates on the project website, including fieldwork summaries, blogs, site diaries, and finds reports. There will also be an annual exhibition in the Wiltshire Museum, and a public symposium on the archaeology of the Vale of Pewsey.","The project's inclusive ethos, combined with opportunities for public participation in a wide range of activities embracing varying interests and capabilities, will promote social cohesion, health and wellbeing within communities living in the Vale of Pewsey. This project will provide public outreach opportunities, engaging, amongst others, farming communities and military families, to build awareness and enthusiasm for their historic environment and to preserve the hidden history of their local area. The project therefore ties in with the AHRC 'Connected Communities' theme. The area is also a popular tourist destination with numerous holiday-makers, day-trippers, walkers and cyclists, providing further outreach opportunities. Current interpretations focus very much on the monuments themselves but this project will enable these diverse audiences to engage with the landscape context of Stonehenge and Avebury in new and innovative ways. 1 The Wiltshire Museum 2 Voluntary groups such as the Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group 3 Local schools and educational institutions 4 The wider public 5 English Heritage The project will benefit government and local authorities by providing a direct feed of data into Historic Environment Records and Conservation Management Plans to enhance the protection, management and promotion of the Vale of Pewsey's archaeological heritage. National bodies and advisory groups will be able to draw upon the project as a model for how to pursue major research targets within a collaborative framework; an approach of direct relevance to current policy, encouraging greater cohesion between regional, local, voluntary bodies and the private citizen in the exploitation of heritage assets. Project Partner, the Wiltshire Museum, will develop a temporary exhibition on the site, as well as run a shuttle bus between the museum and site for the duration of the fieldwork. It will also host a public symposium on the archaeology of the Vale of Pewsey at the end of the field work. The project will help the museum meet its strategic aim of public education in archaeology and will benefit from the input of new material and interpretations to enhance its existing displays. The research will also contribute to the interpretation and public presentation of other prehistoric monuments, including the Avebury & Stonehenge WHS. The project will undertake fieldwalking with the Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group, and engage with other societies, such as the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, and the newly-formed Stonehenge and Avebury Archaeological and Historical Research Group. These groups will benefit from opportunities to collaborate in academic and agenda-setting research that examines a seminal period and area, and to adopt, through knowledge transfer, scientific methodologies used on the project to enhance their own in-house expertise, which can be deployed on future projects. Prehistory is taught within the National Curriculum at Key Stage 2, and this project will work with the existing links of Project Partners (the Wiltshire Museum and English Heritage) and of Widening Participation Schemes of the University of Reading, to actively and directly engage with local schools and their students. We will also work with the Young Archaeologists Club, which introduces children to fieldwork and scientific investigation. We will offer archaeological experience and generic skills in preparation for Higher Education or the work place through placements on the site to A-level students. Schools will benefit from a variety of experiential learning environments tailored to the enhancement of teaching across disciplines. The location of the site near to Stonehenge will provide an added attraction for schools, both local and more widely across the south of England. We will build on the significant expertise built up at Silchester, which was attended by over 100 A-Level and work experience placements per year.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM008304%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This research tests the effectiveness of 'post-diaspora' as a new concept and analytic tool. It asks how this concept can be used to reimagine new means by which African-Caribbean women achieve agency through mobility in twenty-first century contexts of globalization, transnationalism and deterritorialization. Post-diaspora is neither a departure from, nor a continuation of contemporary usages of diaspora: rather the 'post' signals a new problem space that allows us to imagine new futures, by focusing on mobility both as a defining feature of Caribbean identities and as a route to self-fashioning for African-Caribbean women. Rather than linear journeys that result in the reconstitution of a remembered past in a present of new physical and cultural geographies, post-diasporic journeys are rhizomatic: they radically configure the assumed significance of 'home' and 'away'. In rhizomatic journeys, roots are provisional and unfixed. Routes are often circuitous, and return - physical, rhetorical and economic - is a key component of African-Caribbean women's mobility (Trotz 2006; Trotz and Malone 2013; Reynolds 208, 2010).  While contemporary engagements with concepts of diaspora emphasise loss of 'origin', displacement, 'genealogies of dispossession' (Boyarin and Boyarin 2002; Cho2007), the formulation 'post-diaspora' moves away from ideas of homeland as singular and discrete, and from the accompanying idea that feelings of longing constitute the diasporic subject. As a concept, it intervenes in attempts in contemporary scholarship to progress discussions of the African diaspora beyond the privileging of nationalist sensibilities and an 'exaggerated attention to belonging' (Rushdy 2009), to more mobile and enabling articulations of blackness. It is a reimagining of affiliated identities beyond those that pertain to the nation state (Gilroy 2004, 2011; Hall 2007). Caribbean and African-Caribbean communities in North America, Britain and elsewhere are both twice diasporised (Hall 1976), and in the process of onward and recursive migrations, they are reconstituted by different and more variegated encounters (Cohen 2009). The concept of post-diaspora is attentive to the consequences of multiple encounters and the possibility of diverse affiliations.   This transdisciplinary Network uses knowledge and resources of five disciplinary areas: gender studies, literature, sociology, cultural geography and history. The Network also facilitates a trans-historical and transnational dialogue on the theme of post-diaspora. It connects scholars from Britain, the Caribbean and North America, who bring their own theoretical, methodological and disciplinary processes to answer the following questions:  1. What does present research tell us about how Britain, the Caribbean and North America can be understood in post-diaspora contexts?  2. What are the gender dimensions of post-diaspora for African Caribbean women, with its emphasis on multi-directional mobility and instability?  3) How do these non-linear forms of mobility and the production of multiple affiliations produce the conditions for African-Caribbean women's agency and self-fashioning?  4) What forms of expression are available to reconfigure identities as post-diasporic?  These questions will be addressed through a website archiving the Network's activities and hosted by London South Bank University; a series of short research meetings and seminars of invited international scholars; an edited collection for a special issue of the interdisciplinary journal Small Axe and selected contributions to Diaspora: a Journal of Transnational Studies; a one-day policy dialogue between members of the Network and the International Migration Taskforce, Planning Institute of Jamaica; two creative platforms of invited practitioners whose work addresses the theme; a meeting with the curators of the Black Cultural Archives, London.","The network grant supports research and dialogue on new dimensions of migration during the UN Decade for People of African Descent. It is the first step in a longer-term strategy for new research partnerships between the two collaborating institutions: London South Bank University and The University of the West Indies, Jamaica. It builds on existing links between Dr. Leith Dunn (Co-I) and policy makers at the International Migration Taskforce at the Planning Institute of Jamaica. The Network extends established relations between Dr. Suzanne Scafe (PI) and curators and archivists at the Black Cultural Archives, London, and Network member Patricia Noxolo and the Drum Intercultural Arts Centre, Birmingham. It is anticipated that further research will strengthen further these Networks to invite formal collaboration from one or more of the non-academic participating institutions.  The Network will articulate how globalization might work for African-Caribbean women migrants, even while acknowledging and addressing its exclusions and the production of inequalities. It will address the following groups: Policy makers working on issues related to women in the African-Caribbean diaspora; not for profit/charitable organisations and the public. During the project, government policy makers at the Planning Institute, and the following beneficiaries will be engaged via public discussion panels and research seminars at the International Migration Taskforce and the Institute for Gender and Development Studies, University of the West Indies, Jamaica:  1. HIBISCUS, an organization which helps in the rehabilitation of women drug couriers, and provides other programmes that aid women who are casualties of transnational economies. Hibiscus has an ongoing partnership with the Co-I, Dr. Dunn. During the project they will attend public discussion panels, small workshop meetings and creative performances.  2. The Black Cultural Archives: The final meeting will bring together the curators of existing collections both at the Black Cultural Archives and at the Tower Hamlets library for a discussion about how concepts of 'belonging', central to the themes of both archived collections, can be extended through discussion with Network members and the sharing of information from archives in Jamaica such as those held at the Memory Bank of Jamaica, and the University of the West Indies.  The online website will be the main method of communicating events and academic discussions undertaken by the Network. The website will be administered from within London South Bank's School of Arts and Creative Industries, in conjunction with the PI and Network members. The site will publicise the first call for participants for Seminar 1 in February 2017. By April 2017, it will list the full programme of events for the first meeting and the dates, locations and titles of the following 3 seminars.  The landing page of the website will provide information on the aims of the project and a navigational guide to its content. Thereafter the website will be the main channel of communication for all academic and public events organised by the Network; it will host members' blogs, conference papers, podcasts of key presentations and other material of academic and public interest. The website will include selective links with related research projects across the transdisciplinary field: all features will ensure that materials from the research will have an impact for a year within the life of the research and inform a follow-on project. The web-site will be a means of achieving both specific impact to the research community as well as wider impact to both professional and public audiences.

It will run over a two-year period and bring together academics and practitioners who are interested in performance that relates to contexts and legacies of violence in Kenya, Rwanda and Northern Ireland. All three countries have shared histories of colonial violence and, more recently, of the political instrumentalization of religious and/or ethnic identities which have led to violence.  More specifically, the network will consider how performance relates to acts of collective violence, defined as the participation in, and/or formation of, groups who engage in violence against others for economic, political or social gain. We will ask how performance and performance makers represent, challenge, and/or sustain violence? This question will be explored through three key events, and a final online symposium. First, we will consider how performance is being used to prevent violence through an event in Kenya, where violence around presidential elections has led to preventative work taking place. We will draw on the expertise of Amani People's Theatre and their use of Theatre of the Oppressed approaches to prevent participation in conflict and violence. Second, an event in Northern Ireland will consider how performance has addressed, and continues to engage with, violence. Here, we will engage with the expertise of Derry Playhouse, which runs innovative arts and peace projects. Third, we will travel to Rwanda to examine how performance is part of commemorating acts of violence, marking (and at times masking) histories and narratives of violence. Participants will attend the Ubumuntu Arts Festival - organized by Hope Azeda (Mashirika Arts). Finally, the online symposium will move beyond preventing, addressing and commemorating violence, asking what happens next? The continual representation of particular contexts as violent, or marked by legacies of violence, may further entrench conflict and prevent the transition towards new, alternative, futures. The event will draw on the findings of the three previous workshops. The network will comprise six core participants, some of whom are representatives from the organisations mentioned above. Two core participants have been recruited from each country, and they will take responsibility for some of the planning and implementation of network events, including the recruitment of ten further participants in each country, who will attend the events happening in their respective contexts. The findings of the research network will contribute towards academic understandings and discourses of performance and violence but also to the approaches and knowledges of the theatre and performance practitioners who are doing this work, on the ground. The activities will result in a co-edited book and we aspire to create new opportunities for sustained partnerships beyond the network.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW000520%2F1

So much so, that the southern half of Italy became known as 'Big Greece', both by Romans (Magna Graecia) and Greeks (Megale Hellas). Greeks brought with them urban living, religion and wine drinking, together with the alphabet and its associated uses. Some cities of Italy, including Naples, Rhegium and Tarentum, remained Greek speaking under Roman rule. Substantial archaeological and textual discoveries in the last three decades have opened up our knowledge of the Greeks in Italy and the native societies they encountered, but there has been no complete study of the impact made by Greek on indigenous languages. This project aims to fill this gap, and will consider the nature and outcomes of contact between Greeks and speakers of the various native languages of ancient Italy, investigating the changes on the languages themselves, and relating linguistic interactions to social and political factors. This project will bring a new approach to the study of the impact of Greeks in Italy by combining two major recent research developments in research, linking studies of micro-regions in the Mediterranean, which emphasize networks and connectivity (e.g. Horden & Purcell The Corrupting Sea 2000), within the context of new work on ancient language contact (e.g. Adams Bilingualism and the Latin Language 2003). The project will work from a rich, but manageable data set. Epigraphic sources will be the primary focus, since inscriptions furnish the principle record for nearly all of the ancient languages once spoken in Italy (Latin is of course the exception). Recent research has hugely enhanced our knowledge of the non-Latin languages of Italy through the publication of new corpora, including Imagines Italicae (2011), the result of an AHRC project. These corpora allow us to tally the linguistic evidence with known archaeological or historical contexts.  The project team will comprise researchers with expertise on both the Greek language and the native languages of Italy, with overlapping strengths in historical / comparative linguistics, epigraphy and classical studies. Through collaborative research and by pooling expertise and knowledge of different areas and languages, we will gain a fuller picture of the complexity of bilingual and multilingual interaction in Italy over several centuries. We will develop methodologies for using epigraphic material to construct a picture of interactions between speech communities, and for interpreting similarities of script and uses of literacy. The findings of the project will shed new light on ancient history, and set a standard for the investigation of the long-term impact of migration and colonization on language use and change. The project will be based in the Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge, which affords excellent institutional support for ancient history, epigraphy, and comparative/historical linguistics. The PI (James Clackson) and Co-I (Geoff Horrocks) have internationally recognized expertise in the linguistic study of the Classical languages, and a proven record of collaborative research (joint publication Blackwell History of the Latin Language, 2007). The project will employ two post-doctoral researchers, Nicholas Zair and Katherine McDonald, and one PhD student. The members of the project team will focus on different areas: Clackson on the early history of Latin and variation in the impact of Greek on different speech communities; Horrocks on developments in Greek in Italy; Zair will be concerned principally with phonological and morphological change within the Sabellian language family and McDonald will investigate long term contact and change between Greek, Oscan and Messapic in the far south of Italy. The associated PhD studentship will allow a student to work on the language of Greek inscriptions from southern Italy.","Language use and migration are topics of current interest and concern. It is estimated that 60-75% of the world's population is bilingual, but currently only around 30% of the population of Britain can make active use of a language other than English. However, the long-term effects of migration on language use and language change are debated. Academic studies are largely restricted to episodes of recent colonial and post-colonial Europe and the US. This project proposes to take a much longer-term view of the interaction between migration, colonisation, language use and literacy, by viewing interactions on a historical time-scale of over six hundred years.  The research project will be aimed towards three targeted groups of beneficiaries. Firstly, schools and teachers of all schools that teach UK citizenship as part of the National Curriculum will benefit from learning about historical examples of migration and ensuing linguistic diversity (Identities and Diversity is part of Key Stage 3 of UK Citizenship). Secondly, schools that teach courses on classical civilization, the ancient world or Latin language will benefit through enhanced learning about the history of the language and its cultural background. The first book of the Cambridge Latin Course, the most widely used textbook for teaching Latin in schools, is set in Pompeii - a Roman town in Southern Italy where Latin, Greek and Oscan were all in use, and this provides an entry point for school visits, talks and participation.  The third constituency is centred on, but not exclusively limited to, members of the public who go to museums, and /or who have an interest in ancient history, and / or who are interested in the history of languages and scripts. The British Museum exhibition on Pompeii and Herculaneum will open in March 2013, and hence before the start of this project, but it is hoped that it will generate interest in the culture and history of Southern Italy in antiquity that can be utilised by the project. The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has good holdings of objects from Greek colonies in Italy, and will allow the project to make use of their changing display case in the Antiquities Gallery to illustrate some of the issues covered during part of the project lifespan, which will include links to the project blog and information of outreach talks to groups such as the Museum Friends and local Friends of Classics groups.  Dissemination to these targeted groups will take place through different media. We shall arrange school talks and visits, building on the Cambridge Classics Faculty's contact and outreach programmes with schools locally and nationally, and the PI's links with the Joint Association of Classical Teachers. The project will host a project blog (sample http://greekinitaly.wordpress.com/) with links to other web-resources in Classics, which will be publicised to schools and elsewhere. The blog will identify research findings and outputs which are suitable to different audiences, and will feature pod-casts of talks for both adult and school age audiences, and records of other outreach events.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007599%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will use cutting-edge bioarchaeological and materials-science techniques to undertake the first systematic and interdisciplinary study of the role of food and cooking in forging social relationships in Viking-Age Britain. Though often seen in purely nutritional terms - in both archaeology and contemporary policy making - food is central to the production of identity, particularly in contexts of migration and culture contact, and is thus an important but overlooked element in the study of the Viking Age. Understanding of this period is fundamental to the study of later and contemporary culture; it was the social, economic, political, and religious crucible of English and wider European society. We need to understand: 1. The role of material culture in cuisine. Is it possible to associate for the first time particular vessel forms with particular functions or foodstuffs? 2. The degree to which culinary practice was subject to change and innovation, was there variability in time and space, and can this be identified at individual sites? 3. The impact of migration, urbanisation and commercial expansion on local cuisines. Were the cuisines consumed in the cosmopolitan entrepôts of York and Ipswich significantly different to those experienced in contemporary rural sites? 4. The relationship between food and local politics: may distinctive cuisines be identified in politically disparate areas such as the 'Danelaw' settlement of northern and eastern England, or the southern areas of England governed by Anglo-Saxon Wessex, or the Scandinavian 'homelands' of Denmark? Using cutting-edge scientific techniques to identify manufacturing techniques, wear analysis to characterise mode of use, and analysis of lipid residues to establish vessel contents, we will strategically record, sample, and analyse a large quantity of pottery from well-stratified sites across the British Isles and Scandinavia. Our work will be organised into four work packages. Each WP will assess variation in different traits, informed by evidence from environmental archaeology and documentary history, and supported by a successful pilot study. Work package 1 will compare the results of residue analyses on ceramics of diverse ware and vessel form, with various characteristics of use-wear and damage. This will tell us if particular forms of vessel were being used selectively in order to store, transport, process, present, or consume particular foodstuffs, and thus what role was played by material culture in the making of cuisines (Obj 1). Work package 2 will consider intra-site variation, through controlled comparison between sherds from multiple contexts separated in time and space. This will tell us the degree to which culinary practice was subject to change and innovation at any given site (Obj 2). Work package 3 will compare the results of residue analyses on ceramics from sites of diverse character. This will tell us if the cuisines consumed in the cosmopolitan entrepôts of York and Ipswich were significantly different to those experienced in contemporary rural sites (Obj 3). Work package 4 will compare the results of residue analyses on ceramics from sites in the Danelaw, southern England and southern Scandinavia. This will tell us whether distinctive cuisines can be identified in politically disparate areas (Obj 4).   Our results will be disseminated via open access journal articles, conference presentations, museum display materials, a website with blog, associated social media, and downloadable resources and events for the public and interest groups (Scouts, Girlguides and Young Archaeologists' Club). The project will benefit the scholarly study of the Viking Age, and of food studies more generally. Its application in events and resources for children and local communities will aid the effort to improve understanding of the complex expression of identity in today's world of global mobility and culture contact.","Pottery is one of the most ubiquitous finds from archaeological excavations around the globe; a material culture that archaeologists and historians have long since recognised for its importance: 'In their many manifestations, pots resonate throughout human history, from the most primitive domestic meal or drink to the Last Supper; from a nomadic snack to an international banquet.' ('Neil McGregor. BBC Radio 4/British Museum 'The World in 100 Objects'). Yet, unless spectacular, these pots rarely sit centre-stage in museum exhibits; the poor relations of precious metals and accoutrements of war.  This project will focus on providing benefit to museums and their younger visitors, to demonstrate how the arts and humanities can provide a human dimension for science, and bring alive artefacts sometimes seen only as a ""bloodless collection[s] of bowls"" (The Guardian. 4.3.2014 in its review of the British Museum's Vikings: Life and Legend). By engaging children and wider audiences in interesting, fun and creative ways, the project aims to demonstrate the connections that exist between food and identity, and show how the humble pot can illustrate the way in which people and places can be shaped by the food they consume. In particular, as Vikings are part of the Key Stage 2 curriculum, we will focus our engagement with young people in the 7-11 age group, where our interactions will enhance and complement what they learn at school.  Two museums have been identified: The Jorvik Viking Centre (York) and The Collection (Lincoln), both of which are within the research network of the Department of Archaeology at York. Jorvik has a specific focus on the Vikings, whilst The Collection has an excellent archive built up from excavations in the town and it surroundings, though its Viking displays could be enhanced through this project. In archaeological circles, Lincoln is well known as a Scandinavian town, though this heritage is less familiar to the public, and it rarely features in popular narratives of the Viking Age. The two museums thus offer different challenges and potentials for impact. Both are popular family destinations. Young beneficiaries will also include the Scout and Girlguiding movements, where there is the opportunity to take engagement activities into different settings, and in particular engage through outdoor activities. Additionally, we will engage with the Young Archaeologists' Club (with whom the Department of Archaeology has a close working relationship). As the members already have an interest in archaeology, we will particularly focus on enhancing their understanding of how using a combination of different methods can help with archaeological interpretation.  The wider public will also be encouraged to interact with the project through online resources. These groups will benefit through: -An increased understanding of the archaeological connections between food and identity (and how this resonates today). -Increased understanding of how different research areas interact to lead to these understandings. -Enhanced museum exhibits (potentially leading to more visitors). -Museum staff being better trained to communicate the latest archaeological thinking and scientific techniques.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM008568%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project seeks to compose the first-ever critical edition of the influential Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics by the distinguished Byzantine scholar George Pachymeres (1242-ca. 1310). The edition will be accompanied by an English translation, extensive introduction and indexes at the end, and will be published in an open-access environment, freely available to both specialist and lay audience for use in many contexts. The proposed edition has been commissioned for publication by De Gruyter (series: 'Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca et Byzantina' = CAGB) and is part of a comprehensive editorial venture, which will make available a large number of unedited Byzantine commentaries on Aristotle's works, eventually contributing to the reception of the Aristotelian tradition in Byzantium and the development of Aristotelian studies more broadly.  The project is of significant academic impact. A reliable text for Pachymeres' Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics is imperative for a wider reassessment of late Byzantine philosophy, as it will emphasise the original contributions made by scholars in this period. At the same time it will establish and help to consolidate the as yet unknown importance of the Late Byzantine period (1261-1453) as an age of considerable philosophical engagement with Aristotle. The edition and translation will throw light on contemporary educational practices by exploring the extent to which Aristotelian commentaries acted as didactic manuals. Relatedly, it will raise the need for an all-encompassing study of late Byzantine education, a topic that is still little explored and poorly understood. Furthermore, it will stimulate further research on the connections between Byzantine philosophy and Western theology and philosophy, and make us reflect on the transfer of knowledge with Arabic philosophy too. The project will help to refine our understanding of Aristotle's reception in Christian religious thought, and thus will tackle the heated question of how pagan (i.e. ancient Greek) philosophy was more or less easily incorporated into the Christian scholarly community of the later centuries of Byzantium. Last but not least, this study is intended to act as a seed project for the investigation of the undervalued topic of the function of Late Byzantine ethics both as a theoretical discipline and as a practical source of advice on how the good life was expected to be led in Constantinople and other significant parts of the Byzantine Empire. Apart from the edition and translation, this project will publish an edited volume arising from an international conference organised by the research team. The volume will be the first comprehensive study of Byzantine ethical works produced from the 10th to the 15th century and will bear the title 'Ethical works in Byzantium: continuities and transformations'. The project's findings will be communicated to the interested public via its interactive online portal, through which users may contribute their insights into the editorial process and especially some fascinating diagrams featuring in the margins of the manuscripts. Another form of public engagement will be a showcase of sample Greek manuscripts from the rich repositories of the Special Collections of the University of Glasgow Library, which will be targeted at pupils from local schools. This is envisaged as an educational introduction to medieval manuscript culture.  The project illuminates a momentous period of Byzantine literary culture. More generally, it will therefore help to revisit the issue of how Byzantine studies are seen in the wider fields of intellectual and cultural history today.","(1) Portal of the Project and Online Edition and Translation  The project will make its findings directly available to specialists and the general public through an online portal, which will create a virtual community of open dialogue between the project team and the audience. From an early stage general information will be posted about the project's aims and significance, including regular updates on the progress of the editorial process. At the end of the project, we aim to make available online a) the Greek original with links to its three apparatuses, b) the English translation of the text with hyperlinks for the explication of key terms and names, c) an extensive Introduction and Bibliography. The users of our portal will be actively engaged in what we do and will contribute their own perspectives on our project: a) our site's blog and, via this, social media such as Facebook and Twitter will enable interested users to contact the project team to ask for clarifications on the project and make suggestions. b) Digital images of the main manuscript will be uploaded (permission will be obtained and costs justified) and users will be invited to transcribe bits using an on-screen keyboard as a learning exercise. This is a methodology with proven success, as it has been employed in the context of the Ancient Lives project for the edition of the fragments of the Oxyrhynchus papyri (AHRC-funded). c) Even more interestingly, the public will be encouraged to offer their reflections on the branch-diagrams found in the margins of some manuscript folios. Such diagrams were used as mnemonic devices in the classrooms of late antique Alexandria uninterruptedly throughout the medieval period, and they were meant to compartmentalise philosophical knowledge through visualisation of terms making them easier for students to remember. Apart from transcribing the headings of the diagrams, it would be fascinating to see how these diagrams are translated by the 21st-century audience and what impact they may have especially on users that have no prior familiarity with Greek philosophy. That might work as a good case study, which will help us to see how effective diagrams in late antiquity and Byzantium were as didactic tools for beginners, especially in view of the extensive use of 'concept mapping' or 'conceptual diagrams' as successful pedagogical techniques of learning in higher education nowadays.  (2) School Outreach Another form of public engagement will be the organisation of a schools day, which will include two stages: a) a showcase of sample philosophical and scientific manuscripts at the Special Collections of the University of Glasgow Library, which will reveal to pupils from local schools the hidden treasures of manuscripts (scribes, writing materials, exciting illuminations etc). This will function as an educational introduction to medieval manuscript culture and the transmission of ancient texts. In my capacity as the organiser of the Annual Schools Day in Classics (aimed at the dissemination of Greek and Latin works to pupils), I have already had discussions with local teachers and pupils who have expressed an ardent interest in the Manuscripts Schools Day. b) Following the showcase, pupils will be divided into small groups and will be asked to carry out certain activities relating to the most interesting textual and visual aspects of manuscripts. This will be a workshop that will help them digest the material they will have received, enhancing their abilities to work with manuscripts and conceptualise their distinctive features.  (3) Public talk and article in Blogs A public talk at the Hellenic Centre at London will explain in lay terms the importance of Aristotle in Byzantine philosophy and culture. I aim to prepare a short online article addressed to the wider public in which to stress the significance of publishing Aristotelian commentaries from the Byzantine period for 'Ancient History et Cetera' (http://etc.ancient.eu)",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP008887%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              British illuminated manuscripts from the medieval period are priceless artefacts and are remarkable artistic, literary, and historical sources for scholarship. One of the qualities that makes these manuscripts so captivating - their coloration - is also a precious source of knowledge.  Manuscripts were central to learning, culture, belief, and art in Britain from the seventh century to the fifteenth. The ways in which they were made - first in monasteries, then by paid professionals in urban centres - reflect both the roles that they fulfilled, and the materials and technologies that were available at that time and place. As inks and pigments were fundamental to writing and illuminating, they helped to determine the forms of book culture and played a formative role in the evolution of pictorial art. Differing in type (organic, mineral, alchemical) and availability (some made from local materials, others relying on long-distance trade), pigments varied considerably in cost, with practical and symbolic implications for how they were used and perceived. Nevertheless, reliable information about them is currently very limited: the origin, nature, and deployment of the pigments used by scribes and illuminators during the nine centuries in question are unwritten chapters of British cultural, bibliographical, scientific, and artistic history. There is very little work of enduring value on these pigments, owing to a series of practical difficulties. Manuscripts are dispersed around museums and university and cathedral libraries across the country. There is (rightly) a moratorium on taking samples from medieval and renaissance manuscripts: they are fragile, and too valuable. Any investigation must be undertaken by non-invasive, non-destructive means. The technology to accomplish this task has existed since the 1980s, but work to date has been piecemeal and extremely limited because of the expense and size of the equipment, and because of conservation restrictions and high insurance costs that debar the moving of precious manuscripts to laboratories. However, new conservation approved techniques, and modern, mobile instrumentation mark a step-change in equipment mobility, and in accuracy of results. The current equipment, much of which has been developed as bespoke, dedicated tools by the team, has set new benchmarks in security, sensitivity, and spatial resolution. The proven high performance, mobile resources at the disposal of the present team, its joint manuscript-chemistry-physics expertise, and its collective experience in examining manuscripts in pilot studies funded by Durham and Cambridge Universities, mean that this hitherto impracticable project has now become feasible. This project combines unique historical, curatorial, and scientific skillsets to identify the pigments of medieval manuscripts without damaging them. The team will identify the pigments in a broad, carefully chosen selection of ca. 200 manuscripts. These range in date from the seventh to the fifteenth centuries; they represent a cross-section of the major centres of production; and they include books that have a known origin and provenance and that can, therefore, act as a fiducial point for a time and place. From this information, the team (and other scholars) will be able to analyse: patterns of cultural, social, and economic interaction between regions and scribal centres; the use of local materials and the movement of trade; reasons for changes in pigments; innovations by illuminators to overcome technological limitations; the interplay of cost, technology, and artistic practice. The principal outcome will be the first scientific account of the pigments of British illuminated manuscripts as a whole, which will be the fundamental work of reference for future research in the field; with additional benefits in training and providing reliable information to museums, archives, conservators, and their audiences.","The 3 main strands of impact will be professional curatorial and conservation practices; the transformative use of technology; and public understanding of art and science. 1. Curation and conservation for the 21st century The impact from this strand will be on curatorial and conservation practices, with likely effects on archival or institutional policy, in the areas of training and the use of technology. Curatorial staff will benefit from new knowledge about the nature and composition of the materials used to make the most valuable items in their care. Conservators responsible for preserving these collections will benefit from more accurate identification of particular materials and experience of the newest technologies of pigment identification. In our pilot project work, Raman spectroscopy has already revealed that a type of degradation typically diagnosed 'by eye' as characteristic of red lead is also a feature of vermilion.  Throughout the research programme, we will organize collaborative advisory sessions for conservation staff. These sessions will be a standard feature of our site visits at which research analysis is undertaken. There will be continuous on-site interaction with relevant keepers and conservators, explaining the technology, sharing findings on the manuscripts, and discussing the interpretation. We will make a broader presentation of our findings to the library and academic community as a whole during the final year of the project through a conference organized under the aegis of AMARC (Association for Manuscripts and Archives in Research Collections), the leading association of professionals involved with such material. 2. Techniques, Technology, and Transforming Practice The project will disseminate awareness of, and best practice in the use of, modern non-invasive technologies. The research process goes hand-in-hand with the continual development of equipment and introduction of emerging technologies, in order to increase their portability, suitability, and capability specifically for in situ work with fragile manuscripts. The project will disseminate its results and processes - of relevance to scientists as well as to anyone involved in caring for books and documents - through display sessions and publicity releases. Principal Investigator Gameson and Co-Investigators Beeby and Nicholson undertook such sessions, which provide a model for the proposed activities, for the Institute of Conservation at the Wellcome Institute, London, in January 2016 and for the Association of Archivists at Wembley in September 2016.  3. Illuminating the Public The most-frequently asked question by the 100,000+ visitors to the 2013 'Lindisfarne Gospels' exhibition in Durham was: 'what was used to make the colours of the exhibited manuscripts, still so vivid after 1,400 years?' The third impact strand is the presentation to the general public of the illuminated manuscripts explored during the research phases of the project. The project will work closely with the planned major exhibition, 'The Lindisfarne Gospels and the Glories of Britain's Greatest Medieval Library', to be held in Durham in 2020 as the planned successor to 'Lindisfarne Gospels Durham'. A substantial section will be devoted to the pigments of the manuscripts on display and the techniques used to identify them, and to the technological, artistic, and historical implications of the proposed research project. This theme will be central to the associated programme of public lectures and guided visits (coordinated by Gameson) and will be part of a school education programme (directed by Dr Sarah Price at Palace Green Library). Dr Price and her team saw no fewer than 10,000 children in association with the 2013 exhibition. Drawing on the expertise developed in the course of recent exhibitions, the Palace Green Library team will devise visitor surveys and elements of the education programme to record changes in understanding as a result of the exhibition.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR001545%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              ""Famine Tales"" is based on the outcomes of the recently completed AHRC project ""Famine and Dearth in India and Britain, 1550-1800"", led by Dr Ayesha Mukherjee (PI), University of Exeter, and Professor Amlan Das Gupta (Co-I), Jadavpur University, Calcutta, which created a searchable web-database containing c.750 texts in 10 languages, enabling exploration of the cultural histories of famine and dearth in early modern India and Britain: http://famineanddearth.exeter.ac.uk. Using material from this publicly accessible database and the British Library's collections, the follow-on project ""Famine Tales from India and Britain"" will enable the modern re-appropriation and narration of selected episodes of early modern famine and dearth, to engage new users and stakeholders from rural and urban creative industries, and audiences beyond academic communities in India and Britain. The intense and resonant stories of these famines past are relevant to communities afflicted by dearth today, and are worthy of dissemination to a wider public.  We aim to: create new, innovative impact activities to engage wider international audiences for the famine tales; facilitate the cross-cultural, comparative understanding of famine, dearth, and food security issues in India and Britain; directly impact the life and work of rural and urban creative artists in India, and enable them to reach out to international audiences and communicate their perspectives on poverty and famine; directly reach rural and urban audiences in India and Britain with stories of famines past; involve new partners and stakeholders in the shaping of impact; integrate new impact activities and outcomes into the key outputs of the original project. The famine tales will be painted and narrated by traditional scroll painters and singers of Naya village in West Bengal, whose work has attracted international attention; and by new wave, urban graphic artists in Calcutta, known for their issue-based graphic novels and work with the Jadavpur University Press. Both groups are recognised for their vivid socio-political commentaries. The artists of Naya will perform the stories in villages and fairs in rural Bengal. The project will culminate in exhibitions and performances in Calcutta, Exeter, and London, to display the work of both groups of artists, in parallel. Their famine tales will be added to the web-database of the original project, to make the created narratives part of the textual and visual repository. The narration, painting, and performance processes will be documented in film. Exeter's Digital Humanities team and Jadavpur's School of Cultural Texts and Records, who collaborated on the original project, will create a linked website containing high quality images of the scrolls and graphic work, introductory information authored by PI and CIs, film documentation, and accounts and photographs of the performances and exhibitions held to disseminate these works. The project partner, the British Library, will support and enhance these outcomes in many ways throughout the project, including hosting talks and performances by the project team, curatorial advice, and collaborating on the digital outputs. Jadavpur University Press will publish a book containing all illustrations, poems, and an introduction. The original paintings and film archive will be preserved at Exeter and Jadavpur, with the British Library's expert advice.  We aim to publicly demonstrate the benefits of understanding, in cross-cultural terms, the historical heritage of famine, poverty, and food security, which are current, vitally important global concerns. We expect to engage a significant range and numbers of users, academic and non-academic, rural and urban communities as well as larger institutions in India and Britain, with international outreach. The change we are aiming to bring about is wider realisation that famines are not only a crisis of food availability but also constitute a crisis of culture.","Who might benefit from this research? This follow-on project is designed to engage a wide range of beneficiaries, expanding our audience and users to include communities whom the outcomes of the original research project on Famine and Dearth could not reach without our new impact activities. The Famine Tales project team will work with and support a rural community of artists, and connect with their regular audience in rural and rapidly urbanising contexts. This audience consists of the inhabitants of Naya and surrounding villages and towns of West Bengal where the artists work and perform. The project will simultaneously work with cutting-edge artists in the modern metropolis of Calcutta, thus reaching urban audiences to whom this group speaks, particularly, the current generation of young people. Another group of beneficiaries are from the third sector, consisting of local NGOs, to which our Co-Is belong, who have been working for decades to address divisions between rural and urban economies that have a direct impact on food insecurity. As our activities develop, the project aims to reach larger NGOs such as the Right to Food campaign and policy makers. The exhibitions and joint activities with our project partner the British Library will bring to the British public a rare opportunity to engage with a unique community such as Naya and the innovative styles of modern Indian graphic art. The British Library and Asia House, where some of our events will be held, are well-known hubs for drawing a varied public audience - national and international - and are able to facilitate engagement with British and South Asian audiences in the UK. How might they benefit from this research? The artists of Naya constitute a community which subsists on earnings from their traditional creative work, and survive in an increasingly strained rural environment in India. They will benefit from this opportunity to communicate their perspectives on poverty and food insecurity to wider national and international communities. The artists of Naya work and perform in environments where the very issues the famine tales highlight are active problems encountered in everyday life. The core research informing this project and the tales thus speaks to the inhabitants of these environments in an immediate way, while our impact activities allow wider audiences to hear their voice. The graphic artists at Jadavpur University Press have developed their own versions of a contemporary art form which they use to address social, economic, and political issues affecting them. These concerns overlap with issues affecting rural areas, and the project creates a dialogue, using popular cultural forms, that can assist in addressing rural-urban divides, which many local and international NGOs in varied contexts have been working to bridge.  The events and outcomes of the project will benefit our project partner the British Library by adding to its public engagement programmes through a partnership that speaks to their collaborative and culturally diverse ethos. We have adopted varied means of dissemination (through exhibitions, performances, film documentation, and digital and print media) and our public activities will take place in different kinds of environments - from rural villages, markets and fairs, bustling cities like Calcutta and London, to smaller English cities like Exeter. The universities of Jadavpur and Exeter will assist with publicity and audience engagement. The film documentation, website, and blogs shared with the BL are designed to capture impact. The project was interactively designed by involving rural and urban communities in Bengal, as well as larger institutions with significant international outreach. Public audiences in both India and the UK will derive a fresh perspective and increased awareness of global food security through the opportunity this project provides to listen to famine tales from a culture other than their own.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT001445%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              For the first time, For the Love of the Game? brings together a wide network of stakeholders, creative practitioners, and interdisciplinary academics to explore the manifestation of hate crime in football, such as racism, sectarianism, religious-hate, gender-based violence, and homophobia. It is timely because Black Lives Matter has initiated reflection on the impact of racism in society. Also, hate crime has increased during previous pandemics (eg HIV) and is likely to continue and change following covid-19. Innovatively, the project seeks to understand the role of masculinity in the reproduction of hate crime in football. Whilst there has been a significant reduction in the verbal expression of hate crime in stadiums, this does not mean that the phenomenon has disappeared, particularly on social media or in grassroots matches. As a globally popular cultural leisure pursuit, football gives us a critical space to engage with a range of participants. To understand these manifestations, this timely project will pursue four core objectives: (1) to develop interdisciplinary and impactful networks beyond football associations, leagues and clubs; (2) use this network to build knowledge of the manifestation of hate crime in football, and how it can be challenged; (3) centralise the role of masculinity in the reproduction of hate crime in football and how it can be confronted (4) use creative approaches to facilitate production and dissemination of this knowledge. The focus of this networking bid is players and fans of men's amateur and professional football in the British context, whilst drawing on specific expertise from Europe. The six workshops (see below) will provide a context for lively debate of current research and future challenges, bringing together academics, policymakers, football authorities, and fan groups. The workshops will take place across different parts of the UK (and Berlin) using creative activities to engage diverse participants, whilst prioritising local features of hate crime and responding to wider national and global trends. Workshops will involve artistic facilitators (Nike Jonah of Counterpoint Arts, fanzine producer Hamja Ahsan, and playwright Hassan Mahamdallie) who will use creative approaches (including storyboarding, drama, collage, cartooning) to identify the key issues, themes and potential solutions, and to inform two specific outputs (an illustrated fanzine and short films). The six events will explore the following inter-related themes:  1. Setting the parameters: hate crime in football (Brighton) 2. Hate crime in the stadium (Southampton)  3. Online abuse: social media and hate crime (Glasgow)  4. Hate in the grassroots game (Liverpool) 5. The European perspective (Berlin) 6. The way forward (dissemination event): how fans and authorities can tackle hate crime in football (Glasgow) To encourage and gain insights from fan groups and policy makers, we have organised funding across all workshop sessions for these groups. In doing so we aim to provide a critical, yet policy relevant, forum in which the practice and impact of hate crime can be better understood. To this end there will be several public, academic and policy-focused outputs. This includes a fanzine that will illustrate what is hate crime and how individuals can challenge its expression. Three short videos will be produced that highlight some of the key reasons how hate crime occurs across different spatial contexts (elite levels, grassroots, online), and how it can be tackled within institutions and cultural change within the game. In addition, an executive report and position paper will be produced to provide to provide clear guidance for policymakers. Alongside these public-focused outputs, an academic edited book will also be produced. Project details and outputs will be housed on a dedicated website for public dissemination.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV010107%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              In order to discover more about the long-term development of tree populations we intend to focus our study on four English counties. Three of these have already been the subject of other research projects in landscape history - we already know much about how their landscape has developed over time, particularly in terms of enclosure (that is, the development of their field patterns). These counties - Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire and Norfolk - also have very different land use histories, providing a contrasting range of countryside types. In addition we would select a county within, or extending into, the Highland zone - probably Yorkshire. For each county we would: 1. Use maps and documents to examine how the wider population of farmland trees - those growing in pasture fields, on commons and in hedges - has changed over time in terms of density, species composition, age and management. Within the sample counties we would identify areas for which pre-nineteenth century tree surveys or similar information survives; and then compare the data for tree populations derived from these sources with that presented, for the same areas, by the late nineteenth-century Ordnance Survey maps and the 1946-8 RAF aerial photographs; and compare all of these with the current situation, on the ground today. Ground surveys would record the age and condition of trees, as well as their species and numbers. It should be emphasised that the nature of the evidence means that such samples would not be entirely random in character, but we would be able to contextualise them, and estimate patterns of potential bias, on the basis of our wider knowledge of the agrarian and landscape history of the districts in question. Analysis of the data would make full use of GIS technology, something with which the applicants have extensive experience; and recording in the field would be undertaken, in part by volunteers, and using hand-held GPS.  2. Use maps and documents to examine how the density, distribution and character of woodland has changed over time. For the period since the later eighteenth century it is possible to plot the distribution of woodland at a county level. Before this, only local maps are available, and for some districts none at all, so we would undertake more local studies and then use these to model the wider situation. Changes in the way woods were managed - the balance between wood and timber production, the relative importance of coppiced underwood and standard trees - would be examined using estate records, woodland surveys and the like. The more recent development of woodland can be examined using successive Ordnance Survey maps and such sources as the Land Utilisation Survey from the 1930s. We would undertake a similar exercise for trees growing within landscape parks; and for orchards. In order to obtain a better understanding of how far tree health has changed over time, and whether tree epidemic and infestations are now at a significantly more serious level than in previous centuries, we would undertake the following lines of enquiry.  1. Examine a wide range of published literature on forestry and related matters from the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 2. Examine estate forestry records and correspondence, beginning with the evidence from the four sample counties (which can be better contextualised) but then extending our enquiries into other areas. 3. Examine archive photographs and films, again beginning with those available for the sample counties but, if necessary, subsequently looking more widely. For earlier periods we would also pay some attention to the comments of travel writers, diarists and the like, and to the evidence of paintings and engravings, although such evidence will need to be treated with caution.","Scientific research directed towards the formulation of environmental policy may often benefit from the input of historians. This is especially true of the study of tree populations and the diseases affecting them. Any assessment of the extent to which tree health is deteriorating needs to take into account how the numbers, management and in particular age of rural tree populations has changed over the relatively recent past. It also needs to consider whether epidemic diseases and infestations, rather than being something entirely new, have also affected trees in the past. In addition we believe that the proposed research will benefit those involved in the management of the countryside, both at a national level (DEFRA; Natural England) and more locally, including both institutional and private landowners. Currently, much attention is being paid to preventing the appearance of new tree pathogens by controlling the movement, and monitoring the health, of plant products and nursery stock; or by finding new ways of treating and controlling the diseases and pests in question. We would hope that the results of this project would encourage new, additional responses: 1. By assessing the extent to which there are identifiable economic reasons for the current dominance of certain species in the countryside, and to which the character of tree populations has changed significantly over time, we will stimulate debate about the use of a wider planting palette, including less familiar native trees, in the future in order to ensure greater forward resilience. 2. By obtaining a clearer impression of changes in the age structure of tree populations over time, and in the density of farmland trees, we will hope to encourage higher rates of planting, perhaps through influencing current public policies. 3. By assessing how far epidemic disease and large scale pests have (or have not) caused problems to tree populations in England in the past, we will contribute to a wider understanding of the scale of the current problems, and of the resources which should be committed to dealing with them.  In short, by ascertaining the extent to which tree health is a function, in part, of rural management strategies, we would encourage a wider policy response to the problem of new pathogens.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM504233%2F1

Our life experiences, work in communities and research has made us accept that we're part of a fragmented, traumatised system. Guided by Karen Treisman's thinking on organisational trauma, we're seeing the system as the 'client' or 'vulnerable participant' or 'deprived person' with 'lived experience'. Burnt out and suffering from compassion fatigue, the traumatised system polarises people, places and processes. It's crisis driven; avoidant or detached emotionally to cope with insurmountable global inequities. It's chaotic; dysregulated; disconnected.  Our multi-site collaboration will co-design and test the scalable REALITIES model - to piece together the fragmented parts of the system to bring about integrated systemic change through conscious and co-ordinated engagement in hyper-local communities - using a multi-faceted approach that connects people, places, processes and power. We'll think differently and creatively about divergent perceptions of reality (ontology); different types of knowledge and evidence (epistemology) in the system (for example, how dance movement can sit alongside a statistical analysis); and we'll explore the ethics of vulnerability (who decides who is and isn't vulnerable and what does this label mean for the so-called vulnerable?). We're also uniting academics from multiple disciplines, who use diverse methodological approaches to analyse health disparities, and bringing them into deep, critical conversations about data, methods, theories and analysis. The REALITIES model will take us towards methodological convergence (or help us find ways to integrate methodological divergence) that situates participatory, arts-informed, creative-relational, (post)-qualitative approaches alongside positivist, scientific approaches in the evidence-base. In summary, our team will: i) facilitate cross-partner collaborations in three localities - Clackmannanshire; Easter Ross; and North Lanarkshire (NL) - to establish multiple, clearly defined asset hubs in these neighbourhoods. The hubs have focus on creatively connecting employability, health and social care (particularly mental health), transport accessibility, community learning and development, and the environment.  ii) map and investigate how Integrated Joint Boards in these localities work with non-statutory community groups to connect cultural, natural, social and creative-relational assets to address health disparities; iii) explore how excluded communities in the system - 'The Outliers' - namely prisoners, ex-offenders, refugees and those experiencing homelessness are integrated within statutory and non-statutory services and partnerships in these localities;  iv) co-design and explore the new scalable REALITIES model across emergent asset hubs in the three localities to understand how we can collaboratively create healthier communities across Scotland.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX006131%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Trish Belford (PI) and Professor Ruth Morrow (Co I) a textile designer and architect have been working together for 9 years, bringing together the technologies of textiles and concrete, innovatively blending these two diverse materials to produce highly innovative surfaces. This follow on funded project aims to commercialise unresolved findings in the original AHRC practice led grant 'Woven Concrete' (AH/E006248/1) That lab based project aimed to create innovative concrete textile surfaces. The original findings of using linen as the most suitable base fabric to withstand the harsh alkaline properties of concrete will be brought to a conclusion with this collaboration with MYB textiles, Scotland. We will develop a range of woven linen lace concrete surfaces using knowledge gathered over the intervening years to generate large scale panels. Inspired by the initial grant Belford and Morrow continued their collaboration eventually developing patented products. Those developments were an extension of the thinking and learning from the original grant however they were carried out by different means, which ultimately proved to be time consuming and expensive to produce. These new methods of production with MYB will result in commercially viable and more sustainable methods of manufacturing a linen lace. Belford and Morrow in the intervening years have generated many world wide contacts, through promotion of the existing expensive technologies, also finding time to present and write about the process, reflecting on the cultural significance and tension of bringing two diverse cultures - concrete and textiles into one process. Marketing feedback has indicated that scale and a one stage process for making would place this product in a much stronger position. This has been unachievable due to limitations on current technology available. This project application is therefore intended to:  a) Return again to the original findings of the earlier grant and with the knowledge and experience developed in the intervening years by using large scale textile manufacturing techniques to make commercially viable lace textiles for infusing with concrete, hence opening up new commercial opportunities . MYB currently weave lace with cotton yarns and a diversification to linen will be a response to recent client interest in linen.  b) Present the story of this collaboration in an imaginative way that engages the general public; specialist interest groups in traditional and innovative textiles; and the concrete industry.  The lab based research of 'woven concrete' identified linen as suitable to withstand the alkaline conditions of concrete, in the original grant the textile pattern was created by a post devore (burn out) print process to create lace-like textiles, this however was laborious, costly and uncontrollable, so in order to try and commercialise the embedded textile processes the researchers later created the lace structures by laser cutting on pre woven imported textiles. This is currently one of the three patented processes that went forward for commercialisation. However this is costly, energy inefficient and time consuming and we have now identified a need to find an alternative method for creating lace linen. A feasibility study funded by Ulster University research confirmed MYB as the most suitable Company to collaborate with, they have the technology and a forward thinking outlook, but are not yet weaving in linen lace. MYB, is a 115 year old textile company based in Scotland and the only remaining UK industrial producer of woven lace. They currently only weave lace effects with cotton but are willing to collaborate and alter loom settings and yarn in order to take part in this project. They view this as a valuable addition to their existing portfolio. The final pieces of work (large panels) will be exhibited in both Scotland and Northern Ireland, attracting audiences from both Textiles and Architecture","The impact generated from this project will, on the first level, be through knowledge exchange between; the applicants and the community around QUB concrete labs, and more specifically with MYB and their design team. The project will stimulate new processes, new skills and potentially new clients for MYB. MYB aim the generate new sales platforms through the development of a new linen woven fabric that is not only suitable for embedding in concrete, but also as a stand alone linen fabric that could be incorporated in the MYB range. In this project we are asking MYB to weave with linen, to date they only weave with cotton. This diversification to linen is less expensive, with improved sustainability, as weather does not factor so much in the price fluctuation, a recent observation when purchasing cotton yarns. The flax plant is hardier, and therefore not so vulnerable to climate changes. The robustness of linen is one of the characteristics of this fibre that deems it a suitable yarn the use within concrete. MYB has had recent requests from the Russian market for a linen product, one reason being they do produce a lot of linen yarn but MYB are the only design and weave source of damask lace weaving. MYB would like to be able to offer a new innovative product to their existing market plus opening doors to a wider customer base e.g. architectural clients and building contractors. Impact will also occur through dissemination to the concrete, textile and architecture disciplines and related industries. Support and evidence of Impact will come from existing networks with BRE (Building Research Establishment) and The Concrete Society who to date have actively supported the work and development of the researchers, and are always keen to report new developments through their extensive networks both locally and globally. The work of Belford and Morrow has been previously been cited across a range of publications (in textiles, innovation, interiors and concrete) and also trade magazines and on line blogs. This project in its entirety will be disseminated through pre-existing networks, using tweets, blogs and Instagram to engage the public and research communities encouraging feedback and comments. Due to the researchers diverse range of networks (across textiles, construction and architecture) a wide-ranging view point will be available. Interest will be stimulated from a wide range of stakeholders, including the general public, who will not only be engaged in the Impact but the information gathered will be used to inform the researchers of further potential opportunities of development. The proposed activities outlined will take place in 5 stages, drawn up in consultation with MYB, each stage will generate its own Impact pathway, ranging from design development to concrete lab developments, these will be monitored and reported, informing the final stage of the project through dissemination of the work through different channels, commercial, industrial and academic. Both the PI and Co I have witnessed their collaborative work referenced in student portfolios across the UK, being referenced on Northern Irish A'Level Art and Design course work documentation, the work appeals to all levels of learning, we are particularly keen to influence the next generation.The final stage of the project will be two exhibitions; in Scotland and Northern Ireland, each supported by a public lecture to a range of communities from academic to commercial and textiles to concrete. The Impact generated from this project will be used not only as a powerful tool to promote the collaboration with MYB and academia, but to also bring new solutions to concrete and textile industries.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP008526%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              'In the years centering around 500BC - from 800 to 200 - the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid, simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today.' Thus wrote Karl Jaspers in 1951, calling the period the Axial Age (Achsenzeit).  The thesis of parallel religious and intellectual developments in the Axial Age has in recent years attracted increasing interest. For instance, in 2008 a conference was held in Erfurt on the 'Axial Age and its Consequences for Subsequent History and the Present'. The online account of the conference notes that 'it is only in recent years that interest in the thesis has attracted intensive attention from scholars from across the full spectrum of the humanities and social sciences'.  Despite such considerable interest, we have made pitifully small headway on the Axial question: why did the same kind of intellectual transformation change occur at about the same time in various parts of the world?  This lack of headway can be attributed largely to two failings, both of them apparent in the online account of the Erfurt conference and generally in research on the Axial question. The first failing is that - although specialists in the Axial cultures sometimes confer on the Axial Age - there has been no sustained organised collaboration between them on the issue.  The second failing is neglect of the socio-economic factors. We possess a general understanding of the possible relationship between socio-economic and intellectual (including metaphysical) development, but this understanding has never been applied to the Axial question.  The two failings inter-relate, because comparative study of the relationship between ancient socio-economic and intellectual change requires sustained collaboration between specialists.   Our project will begin to remedy both these failings. But the Axial question cannot be answered all at once. The project is a first step, which focuses on the remarkable similarities in the earliest philosophical cosmology of two of the Axial cultures, India and Greece. It is hoped that the success of the project will inspire extension of the same kind of enquiry to the other Axial cultures.  The Principal Investigator's Money and the Early Greek Mind (Cambridge University Press, 2004) is the first sustained attempt to explain the intellectual revolution of Greece in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE by taking into account all the factors, socio-economic as well as religious and cultural. It is now proposed to extend this kind of investigation to India of approximately the same period, in sustained collaboration with an Indologist who is also trained as a classicist.  Among the remarkable similarities between early Indian and early Greek philosophical cosmology are the following.  (a) In striking contrast to the pre-existing tradition of anthropomorphic polytheism, a single all-embracing formless entity is elevated above multiplicity, change, and particularity of form.  (b) There is mutual assimilation between this single entity, which tends towards abstraction, and the individual self (or soul).  (c) It is believed that through good actions we can escape from a cycle of reincarnation that is both indiscriminate (in the sense that we may be transformed into anything living) and painful.  This shared set of beliefs, which does not occur outside of India and Greece, cannot in this phase of history be plausibly explained by the hypothesis of influence between two remote cultures. And even if there was influence, it still has to be explained why and how the recipient culture had a central place for what it received. It may well therefore be relevant that from the sixth century BCE northern India underwent a process of urbanisation, commercialisation and monetisation that at the time had no parallel outside the Greek polis (except perhaps in China).","The impact of this project will be in 'enhancing the quality of life, health and creative output'. The quality of life is enormously increased by the widespread generation of genuine intellectual curiosity (a prime agent of mental well-being), which - however hard to measure - tends in a hyper-commercialised society to be in decreasing supply.  Our project is ambitious, and on a theme broad enough to be of potential interest to very large numbers of people. The difference in fundamental outlook between West and East - more specifically between the kind of thinking that began with the ancient Greeks and the kind of thinking that began at about the same time in northern India (i.e. including Buddhism) - still affects millions of people and fascinates many others. And so inquiry into the historical origins of the difference has potentially widespread interest. Many westerners are captivated by the otherness of the fundamental beliefs of Hinduism and Buddhism, for instance in the concept of karma, for which we will provide a historical origin. And many are naturally interested in the origins of their own fundamental beliefs (religious or secular).  The major means of general impact will be as follows. (a) The interactive website. (b) The public event in London in July 2014, which will be publicised as widely as possible.  (c) An accessible monograph that sets out results for the general public. (d) The PI has in the past elicited much unsolicited interest in his work in various media (TV, radio, journalism, film: see Pathways to Impact). A pro-active stance towards these media will elicit more such interest, especially given the ambition and potential general appeal of the project.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK00218X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This proposal has been developed collaboratively by four project partners: The University of Newcastle (PI - Prof. W. Weileder); international visual arts commissioning agency Locus+, Newcastle; Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London; and Canary Wharf PLC, London. 'TRANSFER-Impact' is a twelve-month project with a proposed start date of 1st December 2015.  The main aim of the project is to expand the impact of the 2006 AHRB funded 'TRANSFER' project and its outcomes demonstrating new and innovative ways of what site-specific public art could be, where it could be located and how it could address different and unexpected audiences. This was achieved mainly through a temporary architectural-scale installation in which a 1:1 replica of the Milton Keynes art gallery was simultaneously constructed and deconstructed over a three-week period at Station Square, Milton Keynes.  Our new proposal employs the practice-based methodology of 'TRANSFER', expanding its audience and amplifying its outcomes for a worldwide distribution by: (1) re-presenting 'TRANSFER' in a new way and with new and different partners; (2) in a new and high profile location at Montgomery Square, Canary Wharf, London; and (3) through new media, specifically experimental film and contemporary dance. (1) This Follow-on project proposes a new collaboration with Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London, in two ways. First, the innovative architectural façade of the Laban Building (Herzog & de Meuron Architects, 1997) becomes the source for the architectural installation at Montgomery Square, London. Second, the project expands on the performative dimension of 'TRANSFER' through the production and presentation of new site-specific and stage dance works that highlight the spatial and time-based aspects of the original research, linking it directly to the use and purpose of the new Laban Building. The partnerships with Locus+ and Canary Wharf PLC are also mayor impact enhancement factors in this proposal (see below). (2) The choice of Montgomery Square, the central circulation hub within the Canary Wharf estate, ensures exposure to a new, diverse and wide public audience. Over 100,000 people work at Canary Wharf, the majority of whom will pass through Montgomery Square on their way to and from work each day. During the working week an estimated 70,000 people use the Montgomery Square exit/entrance of Canary Wharf underground station and thus will have a direct and daily encounter with the installation over its two-week duration.  (3) One of the outcomes of the original research was time-lapse film footage that was used to create a four screen video installation made specifically and only for the main exhibition space at Milton Keynes Gallery. The Follow-on project will generate similar footage but in this case this will be used to distribute the 'TRANSFER' research to a worldwide audience through the development of a new experimental short film for international film festivals and exhibitions. The footage will also form a central part of the stage-based dance performances at Trinity Laban. A key impact enhancement factor of this proposal is the involvement of and partnership with internationally acclaimed visual arts commissioning agency Locus+. Locus+ works with a strict peer review process ensuring that all its projects achieve a high critical reputation within the art world and beyond. The artwork installation and the film will be profiled as part of Locus+'s on going project portfolio, giving it longevity beyond the 12-month timescale of the Follow-on project. For 'TRANSFER-Impact' Locus+ will act as sponsor, producer and project manager for the architectural-scale installation at Canary Wharf and the experimental film, taking responsibility for all aspects of production and promotion. Locus+ will also lead on the international marketing, media and press strategy for the project.","The opportunity to participate and engage with the 'TRANSFER' research outcomes in the form of an architectural installation, a series of dance performances, as well as a new experimental film will have a direct cultural, social and economic impact on the following three user groups and communities:  (1) General public audiences at Montgomery Square (an estimated weekday audience of 70-100,000); at Trinity Laban stage performances; and at international film festivals and exhibitions.  (2) Professional national and international user groups and audiences in the field of art, architecture, contemporary dance and the building industries.  (3) New educational audiences, specifically staff and students at Trinity Laban. In what way will the 'TRANSFER-Impact' Follow-on project generate and enhance the cultural, social and economic impact of the original 'TRANSFER' research outcomes for these user groups and communities? (1) General public audience:  1. The general public audience will gain access to new and high quality cultural experiences that will stimulate them to think about the role and function of urban public place and contemporary art and its relationship to inner city regeneration. 2. The installation and on-site performance will raise the public profile of Montgomery Square as a cultural site emphasising the role and value of cultural activity within corporate urban space. 3. The audience experience of the on-site performance will widen their understanding of what contemporary art in the form of dance can be, how it might engage with public space, and who it might be for. 4. Through their experience of the varied artistic outputs of the project they will develop their awareness and understanding of the contemporary artistic discourse around temporary vs. permanent and process vs. product, as intended in the original research. (2) Professional national and international audiences: 1. It will enhance cross-disciplinary exchange between art, architecture, and dance organisations and the building industry, demonstrating innovative ways in which future collaborative practices could be developed. 2. This unusual cross-sector collaboration will also have a direct impact on policy makers and commissioners of public art and urban regeneration programmes by developing their understanding of how public audiences might be addressed by and engage with such work. 3. It will increase the professional reputation of project partners through their association with innovative public art and high profile academic research. 4. The connection of art and industry within 'TRANSFER-Impact' furthers the original process of knowledge/technology and skills transfer between a new and extended group of professional user groups and audiences. 5. Involved construction industry participants will gain access to emerging construction practices, including the latest dry joint building methods and system scaffolding technology, which are still unusual in the UK. (3) New educational audiences 1. Engagement with the project will give Trinity Laban participants an insight into innovative visual art research methodologies and new understandings and experience of site-specific practice and experimental film.  2. By participating directly in the development and performance of the collaborative dance works, both on-site at Canary Wharf and at the Laban Centre, staff and students will also gain a unique opportunity to showcase their own skills and creative ideas and to promote these through new and innovative distribution channels. Additionally, this project provides new knowledge and insights for practice-based research by creating a better understanding of the potential of sculpture and dance collaboration. 'TRANSFER-Impact' presents cross-artform collaboration on a new scale in a high profile public context for an international audience.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003624%2F1

Individual religious experience is generally assumed to be hidden, inaccessible within the minds of its subjects making research on it impossible. This is particularly true of the experiences of those in historical periods. In scholarship on ancient religions, this has meant that the debate has become focused on the roles and activities of social groups and external actions, with little idea of how to access the interior experiences of historical subjects.  The cognitive science of religion (CSR) offers an opportunity to cross this barrier. However, it too has limitations: scholars who work with various cognitive approaches are largely concerned with modern, western individuals. Although this research may help to investigate and clarify aspects of contemporary religion in western societies, and may entail claims about the universal nature of humanity's cognitive proclivities, it is nevertheless often untested by historical data, or, often, data from other cultures. Those projects that do attempt to work with historical data tend to take a quantitative approach, rather than trying to apply experimental methodology to examine qualitative data, which involves a change in how scientists think about their subject. The network aims to bring together many of the theoretical assumptions, methodologies, and results of CSR. However, it aims to proceed beyond cognition in individualistic and mentalistic terms, and expand the understanding of cognition as consisting of individuals in full interaction with culture.  Through two workshops the network will address: - The value of adopting a historical perspective in the investigation of the cognitive aspects of religious experience, providing scholars who study cognitive approaches to religion invaluable data and case studies to test and refine their findings. - The value of introducing new cognitive methodologies into historical research, offering scholars of ancient religions new ways to examine the changing individual experiences of historical subjects. - How cognitive and historical disciplines can collaborate to develop new approaches to, and understandings of religious experience. A final conference will present findings from the workshops and also promote interaction with scholars of religion in other historical periods, along with invited guests from relevant business, cultural and policy organisations, with the aim of expanding the network and its impact. Through this collaborative process scholars of both disciplines will be assisted in moving beyond their usual assumptions, gaining new perspectives, developing new questions and approaches to data, working with new evidence and methodologies. As well as helping to forge a common discourse of research, the network aims to contribute to relevant public and policy conversations concerning, for example, the nature and role of religious experience in modern societies, and the place of individual religious experience in modern culture, through the dissemination of its findings.","In academia the study of religion has developed across different disciplines, but frequently in isolation- from both each other and the wider public. This project seeks not only to bring together the findings from different fields of research, and communicate them more broadly in an academic context; but also to disseminate them to a wider audience, shaping popular debate about the nature of religious experience through a variety of channels.  The initial impacts of the network will be educational. In collaboration with The Historical Association, the project will develop teaching materials, including, for example, podcasts, which can be used for teaching an otherwise abstract and conceptually difficult subject at both HE and school-level. This material will be of key interest to school teachers across a range of disciplines, both UK and internationally, but will also be made available to the wider public, through a number of different channels (see Pathways to Impact), leading to wider conversation about the nature of religion, and engagement with some of the latest research in both sciences and arts and humanities. In the longer term, the network is likely to have impact across a number of areas. By inviting representatives of the cultural, third, business and policy sectors to the final conference, the project will extend the network into those areas and prepare the ground for potential future collaborations.   1. Cultural impacts: We will invite to the final conference representatives from the cultural sector, including museums and galleries, and creative and performing artists:  - Museums and galleries: the project's cognitive approach to ancient data will reveal innovative perspectives on historical artifacts and visual evidence related to religious practice. Such displays on historical material also play a key role in influencing public discourse about the nature of religious experience currently and more generally. The project is already in discussion with the Garstang Museum, Liverpool about the potential for collaboration on a museum display and related event.  - Creative and performing artists: in examining religious experience, the project will explore the role of theatricality and performance, e.g., in ritual and audience reception. Members of the project team work on cognitive approaches to ancient drama, which creates further links for this discussion. 2. Third-sector, business and policy impacts: Individuals who engage with religion and public policy will be invited to the final conference. Ancient data provides an ideal 'neutral territory' for examining contemporary concerns, allowing controversial questions to be raised, and encouraging the investigation of assumptions about human development.  - Faith groups: Both data and methods from this project can provide a shared language about the nature of religious experience, helping to facilitate discussion within and between different groups. The project's emphasis on the personal significance of religious experience, and its cognitive development, means that it will offer meaningful data to those of different faiths.  - Policy-makers, within international, national, or local government and government agencies or regulators who work in fields or with constituencies where religious experience is an important element: the project provides ways to examine contemporary questions about religious experience within a longer timeframe, and in comparative perspective. Its interdisciplinary approach means its insights can offer a basis for informed debate, without the familiar split between 'science' and 'religion', or between believers and non-believers, and help to develop a discourse between disparate groups.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM006352%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Cold War is often presented by writers, historians and film/documentary makers as a secret conflict, when specialists on both sides waged a struggle largely invisible to the general population - a war of nuclear strategy, secret agents, 'high-tech' bombers, and clever civil servants. Much historical research has reflected this view, concentrating on high level policy-making and military strategy, or national movements for and against the conflict. Little attention has been focussed on the Cold War in Britain at a community level: on its effect on the region, the village, the town. Yet, the front line of this 'secret' war lay in the heart of Britain's communities, both rural - where nuclear weapons sites, listening stations, airbases and laboratories sprang up next to small villages and at the end of leafy lanes - and urban, where the rapidly expanding armaments industry drove the development of new towns. In consequence, villages and small towns across the nation faced the prospect of devastation at the hands of Soviet nuclear and conventional weapons that was unprecedented, even between 1939-45.  Furthermore, these hitherto largely secluded communities had to deal with the arrival of the organs of the modern state in close proximity to them, as government reached into areas of the country that had, in many ways, been overlooked previously. The construction of state facilities across the country created a network of outposts of the central state that over-rode local government and introduced a whole new type of government in the regions.  Cold War Anglia intends to examine the Cold War from a regional and community perspective by encouraging local communities to research and record the histories of the Cold War in the region. East Anglia is unusual in the UK because it contains the full range of Cold War sites, including nuclear weapons stores, nuclear missile launch sites, military airbases, radar stations, intelligence stations, ground-to-air missile sites, nuclear and conventional research laboratories, as well as new towns built around high-technology defence industries. This makes it especially suitable for this work, but many of these locations are under threat and their preservation is a pressing issue.  Historians of landscape and the Cold War from the University of East Anglia, along with our partner organisations, would support research into the history of these locations undertaken by community research groups with training sessions in local history research techniques, landscape research and oral history. This training will assist these local partners to undertake valuable historical research on this hitherto neglected topic. They will be able to record the stories of those who worked inside Cold War bases and also those who lived outside them, in the farms, villages and towns nearby. In addition, this training will help community partners to undertake fieldwork where they can record the current condition of this Cold War landscape, which is under considerable pressure and lacks significant historic protection.  Our community partners would upload the results of their research directly onto the project website, which would be designed and maintained by the University in consultation with these partners. This website will also provide a platform for computer-generated reconstructions of these locations, which will be part of a wider programme of dissemination of the project team's findings.  The project's findings will be made available on the website and advertised by the University and our institutional partners. We plan to create visitor centres at some locations, along with a programme of walks, which will be 'self-guided' by means of documents downloaded from the website or by interactive applications available via the internet. Additionally, the research team will produce at least two articles, and a book that will present the project's outcome in a more traditional manner.","Cold War Anglia will benefit a wide range of users and has the potential to make a significant contribution to the formulation of public policy in East Anglia. The former sites of the Cold War are widespread across the region and their preservation, as well as the current and future use of the land on which they stood and treatment of the natural habitats they have, largely unintentionally, created, are significant questions for public and private economic policy.  Some former Cold War sites are now in private hands, while others are in public ownership. Some have been redeveloped and others have fallen into disrepair. The nature and use of some sites, such as the former RAF Coltishall, are in transition and major decisions about their future must be taken. The project would also be of direct benefit to those involved in the management, economic redevelopment and conservation of such sites within East Anglia. These bodies include the County Councils and the local District Councils within the study area, which will be able to use the data collected in the management of these sites and local planning. Furthermore, the project will allow communities to become more aware of their local history and thus inform their decision-making in relation to the future of these sites: for example should they be preserved or redeveloped, or are both options possible? As public consultations take place on these matters our work will empower local groups in their dealings with public and private institutions about the future of their communities. For example, by helping our partners make a significant contribution to the planning and creation of a Visitor Centre at RAF Barnham and a Heritage Trail at RAF Coltishall, about which we are already in discussion. The data produced will be made available on the Norfolk Historic Environment Record (NHER). The NHER provides information on the historic environment of the county to researchers, academics, and members of the public and to commercial clients including developers and archaeological units.  The project would be of direct use to national organisations, such as English Heritage and the National Trust, and would inform their policy strategy in relation to the Cold War landscape. Public sector organisations, such as County Councils, and charities, such as the Norwich Regeneration Trust (HEART) would also benefit from the proposed project. All of these organisations could use the data and research from the project in formulating local and national policy relating to Cold War sites, examining issues of public access and in managing the historic environment, economic redevelopment and environmental protection. These locations are also an important part of British cultural and political heritage, and the project will bring together raw data and historical research to produce a rounded view of the Cold War in this region, which will in turn allow us to reconsider the wider historical context of the Cold War in general. The essence of our work is that it will empower local identity. By helping local communities gain a new appreciation of their role in the third great conflict of the twentieth century those communities will gain a fresh insight into the legacy of that conflict as it affects them today. For example, it will provide a different interpretation of how their local democracy has changed since 1945, and the role in that process of change of the demands of central government for war-fighting capacity. Similarly, it will reveal the manner in which their local landscapes have been changed by twentieth century militarisation. This knowledge will, hopefully, give them greater ability to shape local and national policies that relate to their lives. The project will, furthermore, cause national researchers and organisations to reconsider the importance of the local in what is often seen as a subject constituted only by matters of strategy, superpower conflict and international rivalry.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007734%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Syon Abbey is the only English religious house that can trace its history in an unbroken line from the Middle Ages to the present day. The monastery, for 60 nuns and 12 priests under the authority of an abbess, was founded in 1415, the last foundation of medieval England, and one of the richest. The Abbey was not dissolved under Henry VIII. Instead the community went into exile, living at a succession of sites in Holland and France (as well as a short-lived restoration under Queen Mary) before settling in Lisbon (Portugal) in 1594. There they remained until the 19th century, when increased religious toleration allowed them to return to England. They stayed at several locations in South-West England, before settling near South Brent in Devon. The Abbey finally closed in 2011, though the three surviving sisters continue its traditions in retirement. That long and complicated narrative, that traverses much of northern Europe through periods of enormous religious, social and political change, presents a daunting challenge to anyone proposing a comprehensive history of England's last medieval monastery. But the opportunity Syon Abbey represents to bring together the whole, diverse range of scholarship on the English monastic experience across six centuries is not to be passed up. In Syon's sexcenentary year, the project will take substantial steps towards making that comprehensive history a reality. We will develop a research network that, collectively, has the expertise to encompass the whole of Syon's lengthy history, and that will foster conversations among scholars whose specialisms (in different disciplines and time periods) more commonly keep them apart. We will also bring people from outside the academic community into those conversations, including amateur historians, archivists and other custodians of Syon's material legacy, and current members of the religious orders.  At the centre of the network will be a series of three workshops, to be held at the three principal sites associated with Syon Abbey: Syon House, Lisbon and Exeter. But the project will also face outward, through general-interest talks, exhibitions, and a public commemoration held in the meadows of Syon House (London), within the outline of the foundations of the medieval Abbey.","The 600th anniversary of the foundation of Syon Abbey - England's longest surviving medieval monastery - falls in 2015. The sexcentenary provides a unique opportunity to attract and engage a wide public with the community's history, and the broader questions that the project addresses. Intended beneficiaries include  - amateur religious historians  - local historians - public visitors to sites associated with the Abbey's history (primarily Syon Park) - professed religious and their associates, including clergy - the Roman Catholic community in general Amateur historians will find much to inform, enrich and extend their work. Visitors to Syon Park will attain new understanding of the site, and the historical process that resulted in its present form; some visitors will have been prompted by their interest in the Abbey to visit its original site for the first time. Professed religious in particular, and the Catholic community in general, will find new ways to contextualise and understand their own experiences and histories. For all groups, our primary aim is for beneficiaries of the research to connect with monastic history and monastic identities not merely as 'bare ruin'd choirs' and the stuff of 'heritage', but as a living (if increasingly tenuous) tradition. Syon's unique history means that it is uniquely well placed to enable such connections. Events will be concentrated at Syon Park (Brentford), the site of the medieval Abbey, and Exeter, where most of its material remains are now to be found. Activities fall into three categories: public exhibitions, lectures and talks to a general audience, and religious commemorations. Alongside this local focus, we expect that some of the higher-profile events will attract national coverage, including but not restricted to special-interest media (eg Catholic newspapers The Tablet, Catholic Herald). Public exhibitions will be held during 2015 in Syon House and at the University of Exeter. Talks aimed at a general audience will be delivered as part of established series at Syon House and the Devon & Exeter Institution (Exeter). Religious commemorations will be held in summer 2015 in Exeter and in Syon Park, where an open-air ecumenical event will take place in the meadow, within the outline of the medieval Abbey.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM005674%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This network will connect scholars in the humanities and social sciences with professionals working in the arts and media to foster interdisciplinary and cross-sector dialogue, develop research projects, promote the creation of new artistic work, disseminate knowledge, and inform industry practices concerning the representation of 'classical music' in the twenty-first century, especially in the UK. The network will adopt an innovative, dual focus on representation: it will consider contemporary artistic and media representation *of* classical music (e.g., plays and films depicting 'classical' musicians) as well as demographic representation *in* the classical music industry. The latter includes representation of 'classical' musicians by agents and record companies; musicians' self-representations (e.g., on social media); and the demographics of the classical music profession and repertoire vis-à-vis gender, class, (dis)ability, and ethnicity. The issue of representation will thus be addressed in multiple spheres. This network will provide a forum for conversations that are currently happening in a disconnected manner, and facilitate joined-up thinking about topics that can easily be compartmentalised.  Questions about what classical music represents, whom it represents, and who is missing or under-represented in its practices are currently to the fore of public and scholarly debate about the art form and the profession, rendering this a highly topical, urgent set of concerns. The classical music sector has been criticised for being elitist, patriarchal, chauvinistic, and predominantly white. These criticisms may not be uniformly fair or accurate, especially in a global context, yet it is clear there is still work to be done to achieve equal opportunities and inclusion. The classical music industry has endeavoured to reinvent itself by shaking off its perceived 'stuffiness', cultivating new audiences, diversifying programming and ensembles, and experimenting with new performance formats and technologies. Concurrently, representations of classical music in the arts are taking new forms, such as the role-playing video game Eternal Sonata (2007), centred on the Romantic composer Frédéric Chopin, and the popular Amazon television series Mozart in the Jungle (2014-2018). Representations of this sort help to shape ideas about classical music among its devotees and, more broadly, in the popular imaginary, although the relationship between representations and the 'reality' of the profession is, of course, not one-to-one. Artistic representation and 'reality' do not necessarily align, though they can influence one another -- but how, exactly? To what extent are artistic/media representations of classical music helping or hindering efforts to change industry practices? This network will answer these and other research questions by bringing greater clarity to the function of representation in the 'circuit of culture' concerning classical music. Special attention will be given to the authoring, authorising, and embodying of representation in both the practice and depiction of classical music-making. How is classical music differently understood when it is embodied by people who are not traditionally associated with it (e.g., disabled people, ethnic minorities)? The network will contribute to the debate about representation in classical music by exploring the power of images and embodied presence to re-shape popular conceptions of the art-form. It will advocate for how representation might be conducted more equitably and constructively by offering a 'key findings' report to be circulated across the sector. An emerging BAME and/or disabled artist will be invited (through a 'call out' commission) to participate in network discussions and produce a new script for theatre, radio, TV, or film that engages with the network's main themes, thus helping the network to advance artistic enterprise as well as scholarly research.","This project seeks to contribute to initiatives that aim to provide equal opportunity and inclusion for those who compose, perform, learn about, or write about 'classical music'. By engaging with the concept of representation in multiple spheres, this network will ascertain how cultural representations of classical music intersect with the demographics and mechanisms of representation in the classical music industry - in other words, how art and 'reality' can influence one another, and how they may be changed to achieve more accurate and equitable representation for all. There are four key avenues for impact: 1.Network participants will include professionals who work in the media and the classical music industry. People such as Olivia Brown (director of WildKat PR - London/Berlin), Doug Bott (musical director at OpenUp Music), Marius Carboni (artistic director of the Plaxtol Music Festival), Martin Cullingford (editor of Gramophone magazine), Afa S. Dworkin (artistic director of the Sphinx Organisation, USA), and Jan Younghusband (commissioning editor, BBC Music and Events), who have all expressed interest in participating (see the relevant attachment), will be asked to think about how they might take forward ideas and recommendations made as part of network events into their own fields (e.g., via broadcast and festival programming, magazine articles, marketing practices). Bringing these people together -- along with academics -- for the first time is intended to spark conversations, but also collaborative pursuits and new initiatives.  2.A call will be issued for an emerging BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) and/or disabled writer to participate in network discussions and write a new drama for theatre, radio, television, or film that engages with the network's main themes. Dramas that engage thematically with classical music written by people who identify with minority groups are not plentiful, which is why this will be a targeted 'call out'. Writers from all economic backgrounds will be encouraged to apply. The selected person will operate as a 'writer in residence' for the network. They will be critically informed and, ideally, creatively inspired by being embedded in network events. Additionally, they will receive mentoring from the award-winning playwright Kaite O'Reilly, which will benefit them professionally. The mentor will provide advice to the writer about getting the play professionally produced; this would enable it to reach a wider audience.  3.The Co-I will share his work at the Music Mark conference, a professional association for music educators. Additionally, the Co-I will author 'key findings' reports targeted at different audiences of music professionals and educators. The creation of these documents will ensure that the findings of the network can be disseminated and acted upon across the sector in a form that is accessible to a range of audiences, including those working in key strategic roles in music education hubs, subject leaders in mainstream schools, and conservatoire sector leaders. The PI & Co-I will propose an article for Gramophone magazine that outlines the discussions had at network events as well as the network's main findings and outcomes, further enhancing the reach and potential impact of network discussions.    4. A network event at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire will involve sessions that are open to the public: these may include a rehearsed reading of a new, work-in-progress drama, a q-and-a with the author, a keynote speech by one of the steering committee, and a round-table discussion featuring network participants. The events will be advertised, using appropriate channels, to creative writers, music educators, students, and people who work in the classical music industry. The blog will contain a forum that allows for questions, comments, and suggestions.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS006710%2F1

(J. Pendlebury, 2009; J. Pendlebury & Strange, 2011) However, their planning and management vary significantly because of different institutional conditions and social models (V. Nadin & D Stead, 2008). For example, in the Netherlands the state is the primary actor with municipalities acting directly in managing the built heritage (Janssen, Luiten, Renes, & Rouwendal, 2012), whereas in England the state largely regulates the private market and NGOs play a more important role. These different approaches have consequences for changes of use of property and space in the historic core.  Although countries use different management approaches they face similar pressures arising from the effects of the banking crisis and increasingly neoliberal government policies which tend to impose public spending constraints together with privatisation and deregulation.(Council, 2009; Dafflon, 2010, 2002) (P. Allmendinger & Haughton, 2012) (Nadin and Stead 2013). This presents serious challenges for the management of the cultural asset of the historic urban core, especially since past studies have pointed to the weakness of strategic approaches to coordinating the actions of a wider set of public, private and civil society actors in urban heritage management. There is a demand for a better understanding of the trajectory and impacts of planning and management approaches.  This project proposes to establish a collaborative network of researchers with a common interest in changing practices in urban planning and management of historic cities. It brings together research on planning practices for the historic urban core from three countries to apply a common theoretical framework. It will develop new comparative understandings of evolving practices and their consequences.  This project proposes to establish a collaborative network of researchers with a common interest in changing practices in urban planning and management of historic cities. It brings together research on planning practices for the historic urban core from three countries to apply a common theoretical framework. It will develop new comparative understandings of evolving practices and their consequences.  The project asks:   How have varying management approaches influenced patterns of functions in, and the economic role of, the historic urban core? How can these relationships be captured in a common conceptual framework?   How are approaches being reformed in each country in response to changing political values, in particular the role of the state, and to what extent do underlying socio-economic and historical factors shape responses to heritage management?   To what extent are models and methods of managing the historic urban core transferable between countries, and what scope is there for effective policy transfer?  The method of analysis is primarily to bring existing research and scholarship in the three countries into a common cross-national conceptual framework. The provisional framework is already in place and draws on theories of strategic planning and area life cycle management (Lindgren & Bandhold, 2009; Henry Mintzberg, 1994, 1996; H. Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, & Lampel, 2005) and has been employed in pilot research on managing the historic urban cores of twenty cities in the Netherlands (Toorn Vrijthoff, 2011).",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL503733%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The stone sculptures which survive in our churches, churchyards or by the wayside in England, are a powerful and eloquent legacy. They are often the earliest evidence for Anglo-Saxon settlement at a site, and usually the first evidence for the acceptance by the people of Christianity. They throw light on the contacts between peoples and places, help to identify the influential centres in a region, and reflect the aspirations of their patrons, as well as the skills of their carvers. Sculptures thus represent a locally accessible historic resource that lies within the immediate reach of thousands of urban and rural communities, yet many remain unaware of their presence or significance.  In this final phase of the project, by bringing together a formidable team of archaeological, art historical and historical experts, we can pose major questions relevant to the regions under study and the Corpus as a whole. WiST will bring to completion the long-running study of every fragment of Anglo-Saxon stone sculpture in England. Since 1976, the project has brought to press 13 volumes, providing detailed, consistent coverage of 3500+ individual sculptures from 32 English counties, with information on location, discovery, stone type, condition, monument attributes and date. Combining established Corpus expertise with knowledge and skills from four separate institutions (Canterbury, Durham, Leicester, York), we will complete the remaining volumes and with them, c. 800 additional entries for the sculptures of Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Rutland (XIV); Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire (XV), Norfolk, Suffolk (XVI). Using this as a basis, we will investigate the entire production process within and across regions, from quarrying, to transport and display. More research is needed on production, chronology, on the intended visual and aesthetic impacts of iconographic and decorative schemas and whether regional or patronal tastes influenced certain styles and forms of monument. Choices were made to deploy monuments and to decorate buildings; by considering the likely original settings of sculptures, we can better understand the intentions of sculptor and patron and the ways sculptural media operated for varied audiences. Finally regional variations in form/decoration demonstrate that sculpture was used to signal different affiliations and allegiances.  We will explore these questions in the Corpus volumes and, via a workshop series involving academic, early career and non-academic stakeholders, develop a collaborative volume - Worked in Stone - a first in-depth interrogation of the national data set. An international conference and edited volume will also open up discussion to Europe, the USA and beyond, stimulating cross-regional comparison and trans-national debate and setting a future agenda. Raising awareness of this resource with new beneficiaries is a vital part of our work. To this end, using expert computing support, we will release our full catalogue and make our data freely available worldwide, detailing some 4000+ sculptures and 9000+ associated images, as well as new state of the art 3-D models. To date c. 3700 online users a year access our data, with c. 67% of users coming from the UK and 16% from the USA and Japan. By developing our online presence and resources, we will broaden and deepen this user base. We will enable searches across the entire corpus, allowing all users to map and investigate individual sculptures; promote our free resources worldwide with social media; and provide short online guides to ease public access. We will also share our data with UK regional heritage agencies, ensuring anyone anywhere in England can access information on sculpture/s in their locality. Together with the Archaeology Data Service, we will secure our digital resources for the future, ensuring they remain widely accessible to academic, non-academic and commercial users in the long-term.","Our research is of demonstrable interest to a wide range of beneficiaries/users: (a) Amateur historians, archaeologists and enthusiasts make use of the published and online catalogues for their own research and interest. In 2016-17, we logged c. 3742 individual users on our website, viewing a total of 60992 pages. 67% of our users were UK-based and 16% were from the USA and Japan. As a consequence, we field 100s of requests for information on local discoveries and existing items and have liaised with c. 22 local groups/organisations since 2011, assisting in the re-display of items in their care e.g. Gainford, Co Durham; Bromborough, Cheshire. The flow of information is in both directions: amateur archaeologists/ historians can learn from the online Corpus, but they can (and do) contribute with updates and details about monuments of interest to them.  (b) Curators who care for these items - in a professional capacity in museum collections, or via their jurisdiction over a particular place - frequently use our expertise, our published/online resources and photographic archive. Since 2011, we have worked with the Church of England and with local vicars/parishioners to help identify items and provide detail for guides (e.g. Masham, Yorks; Monkwearmouth, Co Durham; Kirkby Stephen, Yorks). Likewise, we liaise with regional and national museums to improve information on the sculptures in their care (e.g. British Museum; Durham Cathedral).  (c) Regional Historic Environment Records hold comprehensive data on archaeological sites, monuments and discoveries in England. Sculptural fragments have often been included at the outset, but we share our data with these organisations at the completion of each volume, ensuring that these online resources contain the most up-to-date information on sculptural survivals.  (d) Police interest in sculpture is an unfortunate result of an increasing frequency in the theft of small portable items. We hold detailed information on every recorded item of sculpture and multiple photographic images. This has assisted in the confirmation of thefts, most recently at Hovingham, Yorkshire.  (e) Talks to local societies are regularly delivered by members of the team and these often stimulate public interest and involvement, prompting additional questions and requests for data and images.  We will enhance our impact by: (i) Improving the usability and profile of our project and online resources with: improved search/mapping functions; short on-line guides for better public use; links to local societies, parishes, churches, museums, and in-person talks; and access to new 3-D photogrammetric models. We will promote our site/resources via social media (Facebook/Twitter/Flickr), introduce a blog and circulate a twice-yearly newsletter. We will create a dbase of relevant organisations/users, ensuring they are regularly updated. As a result we will continue to collaborate on demand with local to international requests for assistance with guides, displays and exhibitions e.g. in 2018 Story will advise on a major exhibition involving sculpture at the British Museum. (ii) We will release remaining data and images, providing free worldwide access to information on over 4000 sculptures from c. 1300 sites, accompanied by c. 9000 associated images. Together with the Archaeology Data Service we will secure this online resource in the long-term for academic and public audiences.  (iii) We will share data with regional Historic Environment Records, and track usage by the commercial archaeology sector.  (iv) By inviting non-academic representatives to our workshops e.g. HERs, museums, Heritage Crime Officers/regional police, we will create new partnerships, enhance the use of our resources, and awareness of the vulnerability of sculptural items and advise on better care and protection.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR003556%2F1

The Post-War New Towns are regarded as one of the most important social, cultural and architectural experiments in town planning in the 20th century founded upon principles of Modernism in design, planning and architecture. They have left a remarkable built heritage comprising road layouts, shopping centres, iconic buildings, public spaces, and public art which are often considered to be dated and controversial e.g the road grid system in Milton Keynes or the shopping centres on Harlow and Stevenage. The Network will bring together international researchers and policy makers from universities, government, and the community sector who are studying this built heritage, and are engaged in policy debates about its value.  The Research Network will meet at a critical time when many of the New Towns are reaching an age when renewal and re-invention are being considered. As they approach significant anniversaries (50 or 70 years old), they are facing difficult questions about what value to put on their Post War heritage, whether for example, to demolish 1950s shopping centres and over-ride original Master Plans. Our Research Network seminars events will be hosted by some of the towns that are celebrating their anniversaries and are undertaking this assessment; Milton Keynes, the largest and most successful of the UK New Towns is 50 years old in 2017, Harlow is 70 in 2017, Peterborough and Northampton reach 50 in 2018, and Zoetermeer in the Netherlands is 55 in 2017.  The project will organise a programme of three UK based New Town Heritage Research Seminars, one European New Towns Seminar in the Netherlands, and a Plenary Conference at the conclusion of the project to be held at the University of Northampton in 2018. The seminars will be aimed at New Town researchers and policy makers, not just from Universities but also from Government and from the community sector in New Towns which has often accumulated a significant amount of original research and data. The Plenary will provide a forum for comparisons of the heritage debates in Post War New Towns in the UK and Europe. A key output of the Network will be an agenda for further research and dissemination through a dedicated web site of the findings of the Network events.","The New Towns Heritage Research Network is a cross-sectoral, multi-disciplinary project aiming at significant research impact beyond academe. It is particularly designed to generate new opportunities for collaboration and sharing of research ideas across sectors, making connections between university based research and policy communities in central and local government and the community and voluntary sector. New Town local governments and civic societies have gathered a wealth of historical information about New Town heritage including plans, posters, films, photographic archives and other evidence - and in depth knowledge - of New Town heritage. Many have in effect been monitoring the New Towns heritage and public responses to it since the inception of the New Towns. The Network seminars based as they will be in different New Towns will enable local researchers to present their assessments and their evidence to the Network, and share conclusions with other New Towns, and with academic researchers.  Similarly, because the Post War New Towns are Government-led town planning schemes, central governments in the UK and across Europe have been monitoring, and publishing periodic reports and assessments of the New Towns in their countries. Although very few of these reports have focused on architecture and heritage they contain valuable assessments of New Town town planning and economic performance. The Network aims to benefit Government researchers by bringing them into contact with civic society research communities and academic research work on New Town history and architectural heritage. Despite the efforts of organisations like the 20th Century Society in the UK and DOCOMOMO internationally the heritage of the modern movement is not universally acknowledged as such. The network will draw wider attention to New Town Heritage and benefiting from national civic organisations concerned with heritage, town planning and environment, for example, Historic England, the 20th Century Society, and the Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA). At a European level, there is an international local government New Towns network, the European New Towns and Pilot Cities Platform (ENTP). After their current pilot projects have come to a conclusion, this organisation will be looking to undertake new pilot projects and they will be invited to participate in our proposed Research Network activities.  The proposed New Town web portal that will be an outcome of the project will provide on-line open access for non-academic bodies to latest research and thinking on New Towns Heritage, and will offer a platform for sharing research and evidence from civic society and local government organisations. Ultimately the network is expected to make a significant contribution to raising awareness for the value and potential of New Towns Heritage and to help instilling pride in it as well as offering a critical evaluation.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP006450%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Religious communities are targets, as well as users, of surveillance. Balancing human rights to freedom of religion, of expression and of privacy is a complex activity that intersects with politics, culture and, significantly, religious beliefs and practices. These inter-related dimensions will be the focus of this research network which aims to bring together scholars and faith practitioners. Religious traditions have significant contributions to make to contemporary discussions of the ethics of surveillance - whether in the realm of national security, human rights, trust, privacy and human flourishing in general.  As targets, Muslims (for example) currently encounter the securitisation of their identity (Isakjee, PhD Birmingham 2013) when the state seeks to address, prevent and pre-empt terrorism. Recent claims in a Claystone report (2014) that Muslim charities are viewed as a 'suspect sector' suggest there are issues beyond airport security. Jewish-Muslim conflict over holy sites is impacted by the Israeli state's deployment of surveillance balloons over Jerusalem. Questions around the surveillance of religious communities has a long history in the UK and Ireland, given conflict on the island of Ireland.  Given that most religious worldviews include a concept of a watching deity/deities, the matter of encountering surveillance needs to be examined in the light of specific beliefs. It might be that particular beliefs in divine surveillance sharpen or blunt people's political responses to being targets. Perhaps a failure to perceive acute religious sensitivities around surveillance may exacerbate conflict when a more nuanced justification by the state might increase cooperation? Religious communities also use surveillance. The need to secure their property can lead to the use of CCTV at, and in, places of worship. A search for accurate data on the growth or decline of a denomination (or local congregation) leads to information gathering that, depending on the resources available, might be sophisticated 'customer' data management. Religious people are aware of the lure of online material that can be counter to their ethical standards. Software is marketed that can distribute a report of browsing activity to an 'accountability partner'. As users of social media, identity and relationships are mediated and shaped in ways that may be affirmed or challenged by religious traditions. The network will be interested in questions such as what a Christian ethical stance might be, as distinct from or similar to a Muslim or other viewpoint. The ethical challenges of using and participating in surveillance need to be considered within the beliefs of respective religions or faith stances. The principal aim of this network is to bring together researchers and practitioners from disciplines as diverse as sociology, criminology, theology and religious studies to pool knowledge, share ideas and generate new research initiatives around surveillance and religion. The three workshops are planned in order that participants may provoke and fuel original ways of thinking about specific dimensions of the interplay between surveillance and religion. One symposium will focus on security. A second will focus on the use of surveillance by religious communities. A third will unpack the wider contribution of religious ethics to 21st century surveillance. The workshops will generate proposals for specific research projects and, through the participation of stakeholders from religious communities, such proposals will be grounded in the issues experienced by people in their everyday lives.","The project is designed to reach groups of people outside of the academy, specifically those involved in public and corporate policy-making, the leadership and ordinary practitioners of religious communities, elements of the wider Third Sector, and the general public. Surveillance is a wide and rapidly-changing field within which new challenges, hitherto scarcely imaginable, can suddenly emerge. By understanding the intersection of religious identity with surveillance public policy-makers will be better informed for the revision of UK legislation following the recent Anderson and RUSI reports. Recognising the impact of globalization on the exchange of big-data, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation is currently under development and will need continued review. EU policy on the civil use of drones (currently being discussed) will be enhanced by a deeper appreciation of religious sensitivities in specific locales and religious perspectives on how surveillance shapes the Common Good and societal trust. At a local level, community policing strategies - especially within the context of the Prime Minister's recent intentions to tackle religious extremism - will be shaped. It will be advantageous to know not only how, but why, religious groups respond to surveillance in specific ways.  With religion or belief being one of the nine 'protected characteristics' within equality and human rights legislation, policy-makers, particularly at local government level, will be able to better appreciate the need to balance the surveillance of religion with religious concerns of being monitored - even to further equality. The possible shaping of religion through its being under surveillance will extend present understanding. This has relevance for all age groups but particularly so for children and young people in Scotland in the light of the new Named Person service. Corporate policy-makers such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, will gain from broadening the scope of their discussion of the ethics of data analysis beyond compliance and business efficiency. Religious visions of human flourishing and the Common Good will complement the current focus on individual privacy and autonomy. The leaders of religious communities will be made more aware of the data-gathering and analysis undertaken by their organizations at small-group and 'denominational' levels. They will gain insight into the agenda required to adequately educate people in an ethics for everyday life under ubiquitous surveillance. Religious groups working with, and comprising, people under disproportionate surveillance (e.g. asylum seekers and people receiving welfare benefits) will be better equipped to challenge the associated social injustices. This will be a similar gain for other Third Sector organizations as volunteers in charities are informed and educated regarding the shaping that surveillance strategies exert upon people. The general public will be more aware of everyday surveillance and the need for personal responsibility alongside recourse to legal frameworks of privacy rights. Their appreciation will be deepened of social injustices reinforced by surveillance. The public (including religious believers), will be invited to re-consider their stance towards 'the Other'; people who are represented in the media and government statements as dangerous and threatening. Possibilities of greater social cohesion, particularly across religious boundaries, may result.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN006186%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This research project aims to propose answers to what is a notoriously difficult question: what, exactly, makes a cultural or artistic experience valuable? Such a question invites others that add detail and complexity: in what ways does any idea of value connected to the experience differ for those involved - the audience member, performer, or organisation hosting the event? Does a 'successful' experience mean the same thing for everyone who participates? How do individuals and institutions understand and express the value of the cultural/artistic engagement? And what are the best ways of seeking to capture the experience and the value it contains? We will address these questions through a wide-ranging participatory action research programme that looks at a variety of participants in cultural and arts in the city of Leeds, and in so doing we will add another question to those mentioned above, namely: in what ways does a vibrant cultural life provide value in a major urban centre? The project will utilise existing research connections between the University and several partner organisations, large and small, in the city - Opera North, Northern Ballet, West Yorkshire Playhouse, Yorkshire Dance, South Asian Arts, Thackray Medical Museum, Artlink West Yorkshire, Unlimited Theatre, Heads Together - as well as working with the NHS, Leeds City Council and Arts Council England.  Our research will use a combination of methods and approaches, and incorporate both range and specific focus. To begin, we will ask each of our partner organisations how they understand the value of the culture they produce and showcase, and what experience they think is created as a result. Bringing these partner organisations together to discuss this is a major part of the project, and an early workshop will facilitate this dialogue and exchange, which will be vital for the design of the next research phase. Following this, the project will focus on a single event - the month-long annual LoveArts Festival that focuses on disseminating NHS policy on good mental health and wellbeing - in order to track how questions of cultural value emerge and are experienced. The research team, which possesses expertise across a range of disciplines, from audience participation research and cultural policy to narrative representations of mental health, will work with Festival staff and those attending events to map, through interviews and participant observation, the different ways in which LoveArts works. In so doing, we will be seeking to both gauge the ways in which mental wellbeing is communicated and understood through artistic experiences, and chart how a cultural festival establishes the parameters (in terms of organisation, performance, audience recruitment etc.) that seek to make this happen. In turn, we will explore how the concentrated urban space of Leeds facilitates these processes, producing a city-specific experience of the arts and questions of mental health. A final project workshop will return to the broad view. We will take the results of our analysis and conversations back to our full range of partners in order to share the conclusions and showcase how the work undertaken with LoveArts, added to the initial sector-wide exchange, can help provide a framework for the evaluation of the cultural/artistic experience in Leeds, understood as a broad category that includes individual reflection, commercial demands, and community cohesion. Our intention is is twofold: to suggest to arts organisations, the NHS and Leeds City Council what a conceptual model of an experience of cultural value in Leeds might be; and to produce fine-grained research, differentiated to meet the complexity of our subject matter, that can capture this.","The project necessarily places 'impact' as central to the development of collaborative research practice and design, with the aim to involve potential users of the research from the beginning of the process and to strategically expand our circles of engagement through the staged research design. 'Impact' becomes intrinsic to our methods, generated through creating open lines of dialogue with partner organisations, formal collaborators and communities of interest, on questions that are of importance and value to them. We aim for a complex interaction and the systemic participatory action research approach we adopt is chiefly concerned with working with partners to explore questions that already matter to them; it is through these interactions that the potential for ongoing 'impact' is manifest and which, in the course of the project timeframe actively enables engagement with larger audiences for our research. Through our series of workshops, emerging out of the use of two systemic participatory action research cycles, we aim for a collaborative practice which is multi-vocal in its understanding and articulation of 'experience, 'culture' and 'value'. These workshops will raise awareness of the research project across a range of relevant user communities and contribute to plans for wider dissemination of outputs. We are supported in this aim by Arts Council England, who will provide a regional overview of cultural organisations approach to evaluating cultural value as well as the perspective of a major arts funder. Arts Council England have also pledged to provide us with access to the National Policy and Research Team, and through this we are well-placed to become participant in conversations about national arts policy in this area. In addition to the report for the AHRC Cultural Value Project, we envisage a report for Leeds City Council, which will respond to a policy imperative to develop more robust data and better understanding of the 'impact and value of the cultural offer' in the city and to contribute more generally to the Vision for Leeds 2030. A version of this report will also be produced for the Directorate of Strategy and Partnerships at Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (a project partner and organiser of the LoveArts Festival) with similar aims to respond to policy debates around the provision of mental health services.    The innovative research approaches we showcase offer a platform for best practice in collaborative research environments and the opportunity to inform open discussion about research, research design and the different contributions of academics and external partners and to therefore support a solid basis for the formation of academic- partner collaborative research teams in the future. We will also actively engage with the AHRC to consider ways the research might inform future practice in Cultural Value-funded projects and activities. The project PI, Stuart Murray, is Director of Arts Engaged Impact and Innovation Centre at the University of Leeds, a Centre established specifically to explore and develop innovative research practice that has impact and engagement with non-academic partners at its core, while Co-I Lorraine Blakemore is Arts Engaged Research Fellow in Government and Public Policy, one of five postdoctoral fellows with collective responsibility for the development of strategic thinking and innovative methodologies for the embedding of impact in all stages of the research process. Blakemore was selected for the AHRC Engaging with Government Programme, which aims to achieve sustainable relationships with participants and to inform the development of policy impacts in academic research. CI Helen Graham is Deputy Director of Leeds' Creative and Cultural Industries Exchange, a cross Faculty initiative that develops research engagement with the cultural and creative industries in Leeds and supports the development of nuanced understandings of research 'impact'.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL006308%2F1

During that time, the MIMA has played host to more than half a million visitors from across the world. Inspired by its extensive event and exhibition programme, as well as its commitment to showcasing both emerging and established artists, a substantial and fast-growing proportion of these visitors arrive from universities and other research-based and educational institutions. In just the past few years, MIMA has welcomed has welcomed leading academics, scholars and thinkers from across the world and across disciplines, including Professor Sonia Boyce OBE, who led a research project into Black Artists and Modernism; Tony Juniper, the well-known environmentalist and Chair of Natural England, who supported a year-long inquiry into the culturalization of climate change; and Otobong NKanga, a leading artist and major figure within the international contemporary art landscape. These and numerous other high-profile visits attest to the gallery's standing in the international art world. They also attest to the considerable, if sometimes under-recognised, importance of its collection. Certified by Arts Council for its outstanding significance and national importance, the collection - which comprises three main strands (Fine Art, Ceramics, Jewellery) - unites the holdings of Middlesbrough Art Gallery (1957-2003), Cleveland Craft Centre (1983-2003), and Cleveland Gallery (1973-1999). As a whole, the collection provides both fascinating insights into the economic, social and cultural life of the Tees Valley (and its people) over the past two hundred years, and important perspectives on the local regional manifestations of major artistic movements, such as new materials experimentation in craft and Twentieth Century British ceramics studio practice. Its wide array of ceramic works is perhaps particularly notable in this regard, charting as it does the rise and evolution of the British Studio Pottery movement from 1920-2020, as well as its many connections to, and influences on, contemporary art.  For all its richness, however, the collection is badly lacking in supporting infrastructure. Indeed, as a result of its sheer size and complicated storage and display requirements, the collection is currently fragmented: while many of its key pieces are available for public display, many others are currently held off-site in temporary facilities. Similarly, while MIMA is dedicated to showcasing as much as possible of the (often backgrounded) work of its technical and curatorial staff, much of its conservation and collections care work also takes place at a distance from MIMA's home in central Middlesbrough. Not only is this highly labour-intensive, it also inhibits the collection's ability to grow and to realise its potential as a central asset within the MIMA engagement, audience and research strategy.  The purpose of this project, therefore, is to radically transform the galley's facilities and the way that it displays its collection. Centred around the transformation of the gallery's under-utilised teaching spaces into a state-of-the-art conservation suite and collections room (complete with library, archive and digital content system), the project has the potential to significantly accelerate the gallery's - and the wider university's - research ambitions. Indeed, it is our intention for these spaces to serve as a hub for research conducted by colleagues from across the University.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV01238X%2F1

The historical significance of the camps is beyond doubt. They stood at the heart of Nazi terror, playing a major role in the establishment of the Third Reich, the eradication of resistance, the assault on social outsiders and, most critically, the war against the Jews. And yet, popular understanding of the camps and the Holocaust remains sketchy. These gaps in popular knowledge are caused, in part, by the difficulty of accessing reliable information and documentation. The project will help to address this issue. In collaboration with the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education, it will use new technologies to bring the camps' history to students, educators and the general public.","Politicians and other public figures agree that the Holocaust holds an important place in public memory and national culture. In January 2015, the Prime Minister's Holocaust Commission proposed measures to improve knowledge of the Holocaust, by teaching young people about the historical facts and the humanity of the victims. The project website about the Nazi camps will contribute to this endeavor, providing an important digital source of information about the Holocaust and the Third Reich. The website is geared, in the first place, to teachers and students in British secondary schools, helping them to expand their knowledge of the Nazi camps and to assist in lesson planning. Secondly, it will benefit lecturers and students at British universities working on the history of the Third Reich and the Holocaust. Finally, the website will benefit members of the general public - both nationally and internationally - interested in the history of the Nazi camps and the Holocaust. Awareness of the website will be raised in different ways, with details of its launch disseminated via schools, universities, museums, libraries and memorial sites, as well as other websites dedicated to teaching and to the history of the Third Reich.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003411%2F1

This research proposes an investigation into cultural exchange as an act of translation. It will focus on the transformations sought through the exchange of artists, artistic production and artistic methodologies. With the support of British Council and Arts Council England, THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE forges a research collaboration between QMUL and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro that will map the current terrain of Anglo-Brazilian cultural exchanges. With a particular focus on UK exchanges with arts organizations emerging from Rio de Janeiro's peripheral urban territories, the research will extend analysis of how innovations in the social technologies of the arts seek to translate the city and transform lives. The research project will ask what happens when artists translate ideas and practices from one cultural context to another: what gets lost and what gets learned in the adaptation? How are those who make the translations themselves transformed? How mutual is the act of translation and how sustainable is the process of transformation? If translation is, as is often said, a betrayal then how do we understand and evaluate the importance of the gaps and losses that open up during the process? Through a mapping of Anglo-Brazilian arts and cultural exchange projects produced during the transition between two stagings of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (2012-2016), this project will research how we can create new ways of practising the art of cultural exchange. In the context of an intense interest in creating new cultural dialogues with Brazil in recent and coming years, this project will ask how the UK and Brazil translate each other inflected through cultural exchanges mediated by voices from the periphery. THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE will investigate how the emergent 'interpreters' and intermediaries of Brazil's own peripheries are engaged in a process of translation through cultural exchanges that can re-interpret UK social realities. The translators in this instance will include young artists and cultural activists emerging in Rio de Janeiro through a series of arts-based projects in favelas and peripheral communities, who will be direct participants in the research process. It will also link these particular artists, organisations and movements to other peripheral Brazilian cultural manifestations, both contemporary and historic. The research will offer an opportunity to examine processes of cultural exchange involving Brazilian arts practitioners collaborating with a range of UK arts organisations, as they seek to translate ideas, ideologies and forms of knowledge into new contexts. Arts and cultural policy debates in the UK over the last decade have struggled to resist a dualism in which the need to maintain the aesthetic 'excellence' of the artistic endeavour is pitted against the search for a new social purpose and value for the arts. This proposed research project will connect to, build on and contribute to those debates, investigating how radical Brazilian ideas and practices can bring fresh perspectives, alternative frameworks and different ways of working. The investigation will be a collaboration between academics, artists, policy makers, social and cultural agencies to discover other models for cultural exchanges. It will open up the possibilities of different approaches and methodologies for UK arts organizations and policy makers, and aims to contribute to the strengthening of cultural and academic dialogues between Brazil and the UK. THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE looks to the peripheral urban territories of Rio de Janeiro for an exchange that offers new ways to translate our own values and experiences in the UK, providing a challenge to ideas that characterise so much of our own cultural debates and perhaps by extension the very idea of translation itself.","Governments: DCMS and the Brazilian Ministry of Culture have created a framework for arts and cultural exchange between UK and Brazil (MoU 2010). This research will contribute to understanding how ideas and practices can be more effectively shared, circulated and transmitted under this cooperation. Heritage (PI) has advised both governments on the ways in which the UK and Brazil can collaborate in the development of new knowledge and understanding in relation to cultural policy, and this research project will extend the ways in which they can create effective shared initiatives. International cultural initiatives developed by the Greater London Authority and LOCOG have facilitated engagement with Rio de Janeiro to build the legacy of 2012, and this research will seek to enhance new strategic collaborations with the cultural secretariats of the state and municipal governments of Rio de Janeiro. Public sector: British Council, Arts Council England and the Brazilian National Foundation for the Arts/FUNARTE & Ministry of Culture have all expressed strong support for this research as a means of interrogating their own practices in the anticipation that it will contribute to the development of new and more effective ways of initiating and nurturing cultural dialogue. Through their close links with the cultural teams of the Public Olympic Authority (APO) and the Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Rio2016), the research team will establish at least one case study that is linked to the Olympic and Paralympic cultural dialogue between London and Rio in order to enhance understanding of the ways in which cultural exchange is inflected and mediated within the wider context of global mega-events. It will also encourage the establishment of international cultural exchanges that extend to and include peripheral communities and territories within the Olympic and Paralympic cultural programme. Third Sector: UK-based charitable trusts and foundations that promote international cultural programmes (such as the Gulbenkian, Clore Duffield, Jerwood) are often the most active and agile in investigating new ideas and practices. The PI and People's Palace Projects (arts-based research centre and charitable organization at QMUL) work closely with third sector cultural institutions and invite senior representatives to contribute to the proposed seminars. Further circulation and transmission of the research will be encouraged through the trusts and foundations' own mechanisms of dissemination and debate. Arts organizations: At least 12 arts organizations in UK and Brazil will be directly engaged through the 6 case studies, benefiting from the new understanding within their own practices and the comparative learning with other organizations engaged in parallel processes. Further arts organizations will participate in the 2 seminars and the research will be promoted widely across the arts sector through the networks of the Arts Council England, British Council and FUNARTE (who have offered infrastructural support for the research and its dissemination). The media: Traditional UK media (newspapers, radio and television) will be actively looking for legacy links between London and Rio de Janeiro in 2016, and the PI will work closely with the QMUL communication team to enable access by journalists to stories and ideas emerging from the research. Many of the artists and cultural thinkers from peripheral territories (UK/Brazil) are extremely active agents in social media and will be transmitting and circulating ideas and provocations throughout the research process. Local communities: The research is focused on translating processes by which Brazilian peripheral arts organizations transform their communities through becoming new intermediaries and agents in the transmission of knowledge. The impact of this research on a wider public in the UK will be through the translation of these practices through the process of cultural exchange.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM003612%2F1

Similarly, studies of mummified remains have tended to focus on adults. Yet the children have much to tell us about societal values, identity, and roles and responsibilities within society. The Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo (northern Sicily) is a unique site dating from the late 16th to early 20th century. They contain the largest collection of mummified remains in Europe, with at least 1,284 mummified bodies; providing an unparalleled snapshot into the people that inhabited Palermo in the past. Previous research has primarily focused on adults in the catacombs, while the children have largely been overlooked. The proposed research project will redress the balance, and will be the first to exclusively examine children afforded the mummification rite in late modern Palermo. There are at least 163 children's bodies housed in the catacombs, including 41 children located in a designated room for children. Death records from the period are available, though the information that can be extracted from these documents is limited to the names of the deceased and date of death (Biblioteca Cappuccini Palermo, n.d.). The aim of this project is to gain an insight into the health, development, and social identity of children afforded mummification in late modern Palermo. This project will involve the examination of all forty-one children (housed in the children's room of the catacombs) using a portable digital direct x-ray machine as the mummified remains cannot be removed from the site. This project will (a.) generate a biological profile of the mummified children to establish whether this mortuary rite was reserved for specific children based on their age and/or sex, (b.) to detect the presence of developmental defects, stress indicators and pathological lesions, which aims to gain an insight into the health and lifestyle of children in life, (c.) compare the results of (a) and (b) with the deceased's placement within the catacombs, their funerary attire and associated artefacts, and mummification type (e.g. natural or artificial), alongside any surviving historical documentation. This will reveal a unique insight into the children that were afforded mummification in late modern Palermo. Our biocultural approach will highlight who these children were, why they were granted mummification, their identities, and how the living perceived and treated these children in life and death.  The proposed project will produce a more complete understanding of juveniles from this period which will, in turn, generate a more comprehensive insight into Palermo society during the late modern period. Furthermore, the adoption of a purely non-invasive methodology will highlight the wealth of information that can be extracted, without the need of destructive techniques, to further our understanding of the lives and deaths of children in the past. We aim to demonstrate to fellow scholars that it is possible to obtain detailed biological information from mummified remains using non-destructive methods, which will ensure cultural, societal and ideological beliefs and values are honoured and respected. This research will thus contribute to worldwide academic advancement of mummy studies and bioarchaeology by demonstrating good practice in terms of the collaborative nature of the project, the application of non-invasive methodologies, the use of specialist technologies, and our ethical approach.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV014331%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Our project develops a new understanding of a core requirement of Kant's moral and political philosophy: that we should respect people as ends in themselves and never use them merely as a means or instrumentalize them. We will draw attention to a practical dimension of Kant's ""realm of ends"" that has largely escaped attention. Kant writes that the principles of this ""realm"" must relate people ""as ends and means"" (IV:433). In other words, the Kantian ideal is a realm of ends *and means*. For people to respect one another as ends-in-themselves, they must also act as means for one another - without becoming ""mere means"". Kantian ethics requires us to create forms of cooperation that involve people both as ""ends in themselves"" and as means to one another's ends.   Our reframing of Kantian ethics is important for two reasons.   First, Kant's practical thought is one of the most powerful contenders among contemporary moral and political theories. We believe that it deserves this status - not least, because it resists an obvious danger of consequentialist ethical theories: that some people may justify using others in order to secure wider benefits. Kant's resistance to such practises is also familiar in ordinary moral discourse: it is wrong simply to ""use"" other people. However, this emphasis on each person's moral status needs to be accompanied by an account of how we should contribute to one another's lives. In our project we will explore how people can be ""means"" within social cooperation - without being mere means.   Second, alongside evils such as exploitation and instrumentalization, in today's world many people suffer because they are objects of indifference, hostility and paternalism or lack opportunities to play a useful role in social life. We will systematize these other forms of mistreatment within a broader Kantian framework by introducing new categories that do not only capture individual but also institutional forms of mistreatment. Exclusion from meaningful cooperation renders people powerless and robs them of social roles that affirm their dignity. In our daily lives, most of us do not deliberately exploit or exclude others. But we live within economic and political systems that rely on unfair labour, foster indifference, competition and hostility as well as leave people without social roles. We will develop strategies to conceptualize and address these forms of mistreatment. Our project will deliver a better understanding of central elements of Kant's ethical theory, which will be of interest to Kantian ethicists as well as other ethical approaches. To anchor this new approach to practical perspectives, we will focus on three main examples: migration; decent work and social contributions; and climate change and duties to future generations. We will engage with a range of other disciplines, including applied ethics, legal theory, political science and sociology. We also hope to learn from the practical perspectives of activists arounds these issues. The team consists of two UK-based investigators, Martin Sticker (University of Bristol) and Garrath Williams (Lancaster University), and two German-based investigators, Corinna Mieth and Ewa Wyrebska-Dermanovic (Ruhr-University Bochum). We will also build a network of associated junior and senior researchers in the UK, Germany, and North America for advice and discussion and implement an advisory board. This team combines expertise in ethics, political philosophy, Kant scholarship, and various fields of applied ethics.  We hope that the networks we form will outlast the project, and we believe that the project will point to new ways of understanding Kant's contribution to ethics and political thought. As part of recognising one another as members of Kant's ideal ""realm of ends,"" we must also empower one another to act (as Kant also says) as ""useful members of the world.""",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX002365%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              J. W. Goethe's Die Metamorphose der Pflanzen has been a significant reference point for recent developments in plant-thinking, philosophy of nature, historical botany, the environmental humanities, structuralism, phenomenology and the history of German Idealism. However, the sheer diversity of these receptions of Goethe's text is the problem that motivates this network, since they have always taken place at the fringes of different research fields, marginalising proper appreciation and evaluation of them.  This network - The Philosophical Life of Plants - will therefore bring together representatives from these diverse, interdisciplinary contexts to interrogate how plant life has determined, does determine and can in future determine thinking in philosophy and the environmental humanities - through a focus on the context, reception and contemporary significance of Goethe's Die Metamorphose der Pflanzen (1790). It will do so by assembling Goethe scholars, experts in philosophy of nature, historical botany, history of philosophy and environmental humanities in the same room for the first time. Building on existing collaborations developed through British Academy projects, AHRC training programmes and seeding workshops, the network will take the form of a five-way international collaboration between (i) experts in historical botany at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; (ii) Goethe scholars at the Goethe-Archiv, Weimar, and the Department of German, KCL; (iii) historians of philosophy and philosophers of nature at the Departments of Philosophy at Royal Holloway and UWE; and (iv) scholars in the contemporary theoretical humanities at the Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures, Royal Holloway. Research activities will be structured around three strands: 1. Strand 1: Two one-day workshops on the theoretical and botanical context to Die Metamorphose der Pflanzen, informed by the Goethe resources housed at the Weimar Goethe-Archiv and the historical botany resources at Kew Botanic Gardens' archives. 2. Strand 2: Two one-day workshops on the contemporary legacies of Goethe's encounter with plants in recent plant-thinking and the environmental humanities. 3. Project Culmination: combining the first two strands in (i) an exhibition at Kew Botanic Gardens with exhibits from its archives and from the Goethe-Archiv, Weimar; (ii) four public talks in the exhibition space by project partners, disseminating the findings of the first two strands; (iii) an exhibition catalogue further disseminating findings. The varied nature of the disciplines involved - as well as the partnering institutions - will provide the network with a uniquely diverse range of perspectives. And - disseminated through workshops and impact activities - these innovative perspectives will impact on a wide range of academic and non-academic users interested in the way plants have influenced thinking over the last two centuries.","The network comprises three types of impact activity: an exhibition, exhibition public talks and an exhibition catalogue. All three have the aim of exploring, with non-academic users, the various ways in which plants have determined theory since Goethe's Die Metamorphose der Pflanzen. Each mechanism is designed to ensure that the research undertaken in the academic workshops is developed, fine-tuned and disseminated in light of public discussion and feedback. The audience for these activities will be for the most part determined by the vast range of visitors and public members of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, where all of the activities will be hosted, and it will be supplemented by the contacts built up by the public engagement programmes of the Departments of Philosophy and Languages, Literatures and Cultures at RHUL, the Department of Philosophy at UWE and the Department of German at KCL. Potential non-academic users are therefore a diverse group interested in the history of botany; plant-theory; German literature, culture and science; and the history of philosophy. The exhibition, Goethe, Philosopher-Botanist (Summer 2021, Kew Botanic Gardens), will highlight, in publicly-accessible fashion, the fertile interconnections that have existed and continue to exist between theoretical ideas and plants. It will consist of 3 exhibits loaned from the scientific collection of the Goethe-Archiv, Weimar, and c. 15 exhibits drawn from Kew Botanic Gardens' own extensive printed and manuscript archives of texts and drawings from the late eighteenth century, including its first-edition holding of Die Metamorphose der Pflanzen itself. Goethe will therefore form the centre-point for showcasing the links between botany, art and theory - through the curating of his own handwritten notes and botanical illustrations juxtaposed with contemporaneous manuscripts from Kew Botanic Gardens' archives. The aim of the exhibition is to thereby provoke the visitor into reflecting on the ways in which plants and botanical study have influenced and continue to influence the way we think. The public talks accompanying the exhibition and delivered by the project partners will refer extensively to the exhibits, as well as deploying the research findings from the academic workshops to interpret them. Moreover, these talks will not merely disseminate findings, but also provide opportunities for users to reflect on the questions orienting the network through participatory and critical engagement. In other words, these talks will be a space for extended conversations concerning the influence of plants on theoretical ideas. Finally, the exhibition catalogue provides a means for communicating the research findings to a wide, non-specialist audience in a way that will outlast the time-span of the project itself. It will include illustrations and details of all the exhibits, with an introduction and essays by the project partners on the context and legacy of Goethe's work and contemporary encounters between plants and theory. Kew Botanic Gardens have also agreed to consider its subsequent digitalisation to ensure the enduring legacy of the network. By these means, the catalogue will therefore appeal to a broad readership and provide - through both reproductions of the exhibits and accompanying accessible essays - a way-in for future users to many of the questions that motivate the network.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT010940%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The 'Concert for piano and orchestra' by John Cage is widely regarded as a seminal work, not just within Cage's own output but in the context of twentieth century music and techniques. Examples from the extravagant notations, particularly of the piano part, but also the instrumental parts (the clarinet part adorns the cover of Pritchett's important 1993 survey The Music of John Cage) decorate most studies of 20th century and experimental music (the front covers of the second editions of both Michael Nyman's Experimental Music and Paul Griffiths' Modern Music and After: Directions since 1945 are two such examples). Ever since Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg organised an exhibition to run alongside the first performance of the work (which they organised), exhibitions of graphic scores, American experimental work, and other themes associated with Cage regularly include pages from the piano part, the Solo for piano. As well as the innovations in notations, formally - as a set of parts without score, to be performed in any combination and relationship, including with other works - it throws open the notion of open form and the open work to a far greater degree than any earlier work by any twentieth century composer.  Yet the many complexities, ambiguities and challenges of the work and its notations are rarely discussed in detail. Performances are still relatively uncommon for a work which is regularly cited as being a landmark. On this and other anecdotal evidence it would appear that the 'Concert' is recognised as being of great importance to the history of twentieth century music but how it might be understood and performed remains a puzzle. It is the purpose of this project to demystify the work in all aspects: to significantly advance how the work is viewed and understood and to provide insights and a range of possibilities to future performers. There are three areas of investigation central to the study: 1. Historical context The compositional context of Cage's works through the 1950s, as well as the works leading from the 'Concert' into the 1960s will inform discussion of the work, whilst much of the original research will be conducted through interviews and examination of archival material to present close readings of the production, performance and reception histories.  2. Analytical discussion Despite the notoriety of the 'Concert for piano and orchestra', for its both historical and musical significance, there is surprisingly little detailed discussion about the music itself, how it functions, and its implications for performance. Discussion tends to focus upon surface features of the notation and then primarily relating to the piano part. This proposed study takes an unique and comprehensive approach to the work as a whole, closely examining and cataloguing all the different notations in the instrumental parts, the infamous conductor's part, as well as the piano part. 3. Performance issues An important part of the study is to look to future performances, providing information and suggestions for fresh interpretations of the work as a whole and in its various groupings. In order to achieve this it is vital to integrate performers and performances into the project. A wide range of recordings and other documentation relating to performances from the past will be accessed and examined closely. The findings resulting from the investigation into performance issues will be discussed at length in the book. Furthermore, an interactive web resource will offer practical guides to interpretation, of individual notations and to matters of structure, density and continuity. It will allow users to shape new realisations of notations and to 'play' with possibilities. Additionally, professional recordings of each part will be specially made and available through the web-site which will allow for listeners to interact with and variously combine the different parts in modular fashion.","The two largest groups of people who will benefit from this research are: 1. Historians and musicologists with a focus upon twentieth century music 2. Performers The following groups will also benefit from the research: 3. Students and teachers 4. The layperson - audiences and people with an interest in Cage, either as performers, listeners, and/or readers Whilst the academic community will clearly benefit from the research, it is the intention that this should have maximum reach to a wider community interested in exploring and promoting the music of John Cage and, more widely, experimental music. The benefits to the academic community are detailed in the 'Academic Beneficiaries' document. Performers, both professional and amateur, are the other largest group to benefit tangibly from the outputs of this research. It is hoped that the monograph will have a direct relevance to the development of performance practice and act as a suitable point of reference for anyone wishing to understand how the work functions as the micro and macro levels. The book has been proposed to Oxford University Press, whose Studies in Musical Genesis, Structure & Interpretation series is generally less expensive than many scholarly volumes ensuring the possibility of a wider audience than is the norm for scholarly output. Suzanne Ryan of OUP has stated that it is a volume that they would like pursue and once sample chapters are available to follow the initial book proposal, the investigators are confident that a contract will be issued. The interactive website is an innovative and practical means of exploring how the notations work, how they might sound and be realized, and what the potential of each notation and the work as a whole might be. There is no doubt that, no matter how well-known the work is, its many ambiguities, challenges and complexities serve to dissuade people from engaging with and performing the work. The aim of the website is to remove many of these obstacles and provide real examples of how the notations may be realised, drawing upon sources from other pianists and instrumentalists, as well as structures that will enable new realisations to be created. Whilst this is in part aimed at enabling more and more varied performances of the work, its aim is also to provide a learning tool for students, amateurs and the layperson to engage with Cage's procedures and the work itself. It is hoped that it may serve as a model for more innovative means of engaging with such indeterminate works in the future. Thomas's work on the Peters Edition educational handbook to performing Cage - aimed at schools and Further/Higher Education institutions and supported by Cage's publishers and the John Cage Trust - serves as a strong base from which this website will draw to make the environment an accessible one for the widest possible variety of user. It is the intention to promote the website through a variety of means, but particularly in schools, colleges and Higher Education institutions internationally, working with Peters Edition and the John Cage Trust. Links to the website, as well as extra video documentation of performances and presentations, will be highlighted through the University's presence on iTunesU, which is developing significantly over 2014-15 and which increases the reach of research projects such as this outside of the academic context.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM008444%2F1

These costs can be significant, and heighten the risk of poverty amongst people with disabilities and their households. In turn, unmet expenses can lead to worsening functioning, social participation, well-being and ultimately poverty. Addressing extra costs is central to the fulfilment of the UNCRPD and the commitments of the Global Summit, including promoting full and effective participation and ensuring the economic, social and cultural rights of people with disabilities.  There is growing interest from researchers and policymakers in measuring extra costs and identifying strategies to cover them in policies and programmes, particularly social protection. However, a recent systematic review highlighted that there is a lack of consensus on best practices for measuring and interpreting extra costs across frequently used methodologies despite the rapid proliferation of studies this area. As such, estimates generated are often not comparable and are highly sensitive to design choices. Newer methods, particularly the Goods and Services Required approach require development, including input from people with disabilities, for widespread use. Guidance is also needed for interpreting extra costs estimates across methodologies and identifying solutions to improving access to required goods and services while minimising out-of-pocket spending.  Consequently, this proposal will establish a network for measuring and addressing disability-related extra costs. It will develop a toolkit that provides best practices and step-by-step guidance for collecting and analysing data on extra costs across three commonly used methods (Goods and Services, Goods and Services Required, Standard of Living). These best practices will be informed through consensus-building and participatory co-development. The network will also produce a policy brief with co-developed recommendations for strategies to cover extra costs through social protection and other policies and an edited journal edition on extra costs with summary articles on the toolkit and recommendations. The outputs of the network will be disseminated widely to other academics, national governments, OPDs, NGOs and international organisations (e.g., World Bank, ILO, UN agencies, WHO).  The network will be comprised of six core members and an active advisory group. The core members and advisory group include people with disabilities, researchers, OPD representatives, policymakers and practitioners working in this field. The network will have a cross-disciplinary approach, with researchers from public health, economics, sociology, social policy and law backgrounds. Members of the network are based in a wide range of countries (e.g., UK, US, Colombia, Peru, Georgia, Indonesia, South Africa) and have experience working on disability, extra costs and social protection in multiple contexts and from different perspectives (e.g., research, policy, programmatic, advocacy). They will work in equitable partnership through online and in-person meetings and workshops to develop the proposed outputs and strengthen current and future collaborations on this topic.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX009580%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              1. Further evaluation of community-based learning (CBL): Following targeted, community-based performance events in both case study areas (September, 2012), we are currently evaluating these activities by gauging responses and perceptions of relevant stakeholders/local residents. Brief, post-project surveys are being conducted at street level, as well as some longer interviews. However, in order to explore in greater depth the nature of community-based learning that comes from engagement with these arts interventions, we would like to experiment with further, in-depth reflection in the form of focus group discussions conducted at more of a longitudinal remove from the September events (in order to gauge what impact, if any, the project has made over a sustained time period). The proposal here is for research assistant support to co-ordinate/help analyse data from focus group discussions, during which participants will be asked to reflect critically on their memories of the project's activities and the themes/issues arising. These evaluations will help inform strategies for the developing the legacy and potential replicability of the current project.  2. Further development of creative outcomes; exploration of pathways to impact: The public presentations (September 2012), in both Eastville and Shipley, led to various requests for further follow-up. Feedback in Eastville has highlighted the value of local water narratives as a stimulus for engagement and community learning, with members of the public requesting copies of the narrative-based audio tracks used to accompany our site-specific dance promenade. We propose to extend this dimension of the project by working with communities in the production of short, digital video files, containing audio narratives and complementary visuals, which can be collected on DVD and viewed online (thereby ensuring the accessibility and sustainability of this narrative resource). We plan to screen these pieces publicly in May 2013, at Glenfrome Primary School (host to several project activities), as part of an event provisionally titled ""More Films from the River Bank."" (Several local groups were unable to make the first showing of local, river-themed films in September 2012, and there have been requests for a re-run). The digital stories will also be lodged at 'Bristol Stories' - a creative online digital storytelling project (run in partnership between Watershed and Bristol Museums, Galleries and Archives Service). In Shipley, there have been numerous requests for us to remount the scripted promenade performances staged over one weekend in September, in order to reach further audience members. (We presented five cycles of our three interlocking 'routes' connecting different areas in the vicinity of the local waterways: see feedback collated at http://multi-story-shipley.co.uk/?p=310 .) Having established a presence and identity in the area, there is a real opportunity to use a remount of the performances to further the public dialogue around them, and further develop the project's potential impact. Bradford Council has asked us to present the performances again in conjunction with their own community initiatives. We would also look to further the involvement of the Environment Agency (with major flood situations to respond to in Yorkshire during the summer, their capacity to participate directly in the run-up to September was limited). Building on a developing relationship with Titus Salt High School (serves the local area), we plan to hold various events/discussions at the school in conjunction with the remounted performances, to maximise local understanding and awareness of the environment/heritage issues arising. We also plan to target some performances specifically at secondary-school students, in order to gauge their effectiveness with that particular age group.  3. Further development of primary school initiative. A key part of our engagement in Eastville has involved the developing relationship with Glenfrome Primary School, where curriculum development work around local river/flood awareness is ongoing. Engaging children, and through them their families, in the process of story-gathering, local knowledge-sharing, and creative response, is seen by stakeholders as a particularly impactful and transferable methodology. We are working with the school to develop a teacher's pack and web resources, usable in other contexts, which will encourage pupils to learn about, and respond creatively to, rivers in their immediate vicinity (their histories, natural features, and the risks they represent). We are looking to develop these outcomes in both case study areas. In Bristol, through the engagement of the City Council, the work at Glenfrome will be cascaded to other primary schools along the River Frome, and in other flood risk settings (such as the Brislington Brook rapid response catchment) that have memories of the 1968 floods in Bristol. In Bradford, we plan to pilot the teacher's pack through use in several area schools, working towards a sited public performance in May at the ""Mirror Pool"" - a major new water feature in the heart of the city centre. This initiative is in response to a specific invitation from Bradford Council (arising from the Shipley project) to create a flood-themed performance for the opening ceremony of the EU-wide Flood Resilient Cities conference (Interreg IVB). Our proposal to develop both a performance and exhibition for the city centre site, by encouraging Bradford area primary school children to investigate Bradford Beck and its tributaries, has been well received. Already several schools have confirmed their involvement. Bradford Council is supporting the costs of the Mirror Pool performance as well as providing schools contacts, but additional resources are needed to properly develop/evaluate this 'roll-out' of the primary school work to a wider constituency (e.g. research assistant support, materials costs, etc.).  Note: In both case study areas, these further developments will provide us with opportunities to explore synergies with DEFRA-funded pilot catchment projects. In Bradford, we are looking at using the Mirror Pool initiative to raise public awareness of the Aire Rivers Trust's Catchment Plan for Bradford Beck (developed with DEFRA funding during 2012-13). In Bristol, our work on water narratives will feed directly into the 'Bristol Avon River Story' - the public-facing part of the DEFRA-funded pilot project for the Bristol Avon catchment, which includes the Frome (Bath & NE Somerset Council/Avon Frome Partnership).",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL503472%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Driven by the growing recognition of the importance of design in national innovation, design policy is an emerging subject of research interest. Design policies are 'sets of rules, activities, and processes to support design through the reinforcement of design capabilities at all levels of the policy cycle' by DeEP. Governments in countries where design and innovation are considered core competitive advantage actively seek to implement policies to create encouraging environments for the prosperity of design innovation. Research into design policy in this context will focus on the relevance and effectiveness of government intervention within the design industry. There is an imperative to advance thinking through collaboration and to share experience. Networking and research in this subject has attracted growing investment. However, collaboration with partners outside of the EU is underdeveloped. A fast changing technology base and novel innovation models allows 'underdeveloped' countries to leap-frog conventional development patterns, with significant impact on the global innovation landscape. Each region can no longer consider its innovation policies in isolation. Collaboration with these countries is as important as with EU partners.  This is especially relevant in the case of China, one of the biggest trade partners with EU and the largest R&D investor after the US. China now aims to transform its economy away from a reliance on low-skill and resource-intensive manufacturing, and has recognised the necessity of design innovation in achieving structural transformation of industries. However, these policies and their execution remain unclear outside of China and research in this field is still scarce.  In the UK, design is viewed as an important and integral dimension of innovation policy. As one of the largest innovation exporters, it is strategically important for the UK's policy makers to gain knowledge of China, thus enabling them to contextualise their relevance to the UK's design industry and economy, and capture opportunities afforded by transformation in China. Moreover, no consideration has been given to how the UK might best develop policies which capitalise on the opportunities.  The study aims to develop a UK-China network in design policy to facilitate interactions between UK and China, and between researchers and policy makers. This network is aimed at professional, educational, and government organizations which might contribute to the development and management of initiatives to either grow business or design capability and capacity. Through a series of workshops and seminars, the project will develop partnerships to share good practices in design policy development and to stimulate discussions on this topic. This project will also help build capacity in design policy research, and will inform the future development of the research networking theme. The project will conclude by undertaking a mapping exercise to understand the focuses and principles of policy making in each country; and from this, identify differences and similarities in the approaches taken by each country in supporting design innovation. This will in turn provide the basis for a generic model of design policy which will be disseminated at a final event to be held in London, and will be used to inform national and regional policies supporting the design sector.","The proposal will be of significant benefit to industry/commercial organisations, business support agencies and trade associations, policy makers, and academics, in identifying design policies which stimulate and cultivate innovation activity within both China and the UK, and the means by which each region may cross engage with these. There are a number of key stakeholders and beneficiaries within this project outwith the academic community: 1. The UK and Chinese governments, and other countries involved in an extended network beyond the lifespan of the project. The research will inform innovation policy and strategy in the context of global innovation - at both national and regional levels through government agencies, regional authorities and local enterprise partnerships - leading towards the development of new models/thinking on government intervention. 2. Organisations directly involved in the delivery and exploitation of design; these include freelancers/designers/design agencies and regional private and public sector design clients/users. These organisations will be afforded the opportunity to discuss policy implications and how they relate to their business through a series of consultation events, and their experiences fed through to better model policy impact and outcomes. These organisations will benefit from increased insight into current and prospective policies, and the development of business models which capitalise on these, in terms of either design supply or demand. 3. Representative trade bodies and professional practitioner groups, such as the Design Council, BDI (British Design Innovation), NESTA, & DBA (Design Business Association).  4. Funding bodies, including: the Research Councils (AHRC, EPSRC, ESRC and RCUK), the TSB, the EU (through the Horizon 2020 programme) and further afield, the Research Councils of China (National Natural Science Fund, National Social Science Fund and Ministry of Education Social Science Fund) and regional funding bodies in China (Shanghai Philosophy Social Science Fund, and Shanghai Municipal Education Commission Research Innovation Fund). These organisations will be encouraged to develop programmes in supporting research into design and innovation. The form of intervention and means of dissemination have been designed to maximally engage each of these beneficiary types in terms of location, timing, format and accessibility, and each will be represented on the Steering Committee to ensure their voices are captured.  The final dissemination event will be held in London, and engage a wide audience, including second tier beneficiaries. This will be promoted through the Design Council, NESTA, the DBA (Design Business Association), and other sector trade associations, and targeted at BIS, regional LEPs and relevant client sector associations.  A sector specific policy report will provide an executive summary of findings from each of the consultation events, provide rudimentary theoretical frameworks and reflect on new thinking. This will be posted to key policy makers and wider stakeholders, major libraries and an electronic version made available online. Project datasets, findings and summaries will be promoted and made available via an online repository, developed as part of the project; a mirror Chinese language site will be jointly hosted and funded by Shanghai Jiao Tong and Beijing Union Universities. In addition, a minimum of two papers will be presented at international design conferences across Europe and Asia.  It is anticipated that 20 organisations will attend each of the consultation events (totalling 80 across the project), with a further 40 attending the dissemination event. In addition to the 120 organisations participating in the activities, an estimated 80 organisations will benefit indirectly through awareness raising activities and use of the online resource.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL015676%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The project focuses on music-making in situations of modern dying and in relation to both (i) end-of-life (time-limited illnesses or conditions) and (ii) late life (more lengthy 'dwindling' and/or long-term disability). The research begins with a basic question which in our view has not yet been answered adequately: how does music work in situations of care? Behind this question is an assumption that musical care is more complex than models in music therapy and community music might imply. These models have tended to prioritise the activities and agencies of specialist music providers through a notion of music 'for' 'care recipients' and in individualistic and pathologised ways. But looking at music 'for care' (as opposed to 'care for' music) sidesteps the complex collaborative practices, and forms of agency, on the part of all the people involved (musicians, music therapists, carers, health professionals, family and so-called 'care-receivers'), that make music helpful (and meaningful) within scenes of care. A focus on this practice brings to the surface three otherwise implicit problems in the music and care literatures. These are perceptual, ontological and methodological. Processes of musical engagement are often tacit, fleeting and socially-spatially distributed and therefore difficult to perceive. They are also tied to a language of 'music' as an object and therefore to an ontology of stimulus-response rather than music as a joint activity. They are difficult to document unless they are observed in temporal and spatial contexts and in terms of their evolving histories - and for this specialist methods are required.  The methodological perspective to be employed is ethnographic, to trace connections and relationships between people as they are crafted from moment to moment in real time through music and in ways that may be consequential for action opportunities within settings of care. The project will produce four interlinked ethnographic case studies:  (1) A longitudinal study of community music therapy in a care facility (with specialty in neuro-disability), tracking the micro-detail and developing connections within and between individual and collective musical-communicative work (2) and (3) Studies of music/music therapy across the milieu of two flagship hospices, one in the UK, one in Norway. (4) A study of a novel approach to working relationally with people with memory loss by cueing pre-chosen sounds and memories using simple digital resources. In each case, the project will examine the subtle, adaptive, and often unnoticed practices of managing to make and attend to music under constrained circumstances - how mutual orientation takes shape, how allowances are made, how musical gestures and acts are supported, by whom, with what and how. This focus will in turn support a second key task which will be to map the diversity of musical practices to be found and to follow these practices as they are connected (by participants) to other practices, activities, situations, and events that develop concurrently within the setting and in ways that inform future events. Ultimately, the project will address the question of how making music together may open new opportunities for caring understood in its widest sense, for example, fostering musicalised situations within which clients and carers may discover new forms of relation, empathy, activity, and mutual understanding.","Four interlinked groups will benefit: (1) Music Therapists, Community Musicians, Music & Health Practitioners Increasingly Music therapists, community musicians and music & health practitioners are working in late and end-of-life settings, as individual specialists or as part of large-scale initiatives. Practitioners and service organizations speak of the need to develop effective techniques for 'reaching' the various groups with whom they work. But the current framework for thinking about their role and musical relationship with those groups (care recipients, families of care recipients, care staff) often portrays musical activity as specialist 'intervention' in ways that emphasize the 'delivery' aspect of music to people - through performances or more interactive work. The project will raise awareness of musicking in scenes of care as mutual, reciprocal and 'ecological' in ways currently under-appreciated. It will work with musicians and music therapists in bespoke workshops and symposia to highlight the often-subtle activities, practices and contributions to on-going musicking made by care recipients.  Our aim will be to enrich curricular resources for both expanded theoretical perspectives and fine-grained practical coaching in music therapy training. We will run workshops with music therapy and community music trainers, presenting a novel perspective on what counts as 'music', and how care and music interleave in practice. (We have experience of running a highly successful Masterclass on Ethnography for early career music therapists in 2017 at Exeter.) In these events, Ansdell, Schmid and Simpson will provide participant workshops specifically to present perspectives and techniques and to mentor practitioners. DeNora will contribute a wider perspective linking alternative music aesthetics and ontologies within a sociology of health and illness perspective. Rolvjord will offer specialist commentary on eliciting client perspectives and our partners from Earl Mountbatten will share their flagship practices for community-hospice interchange (as part of a wider education project musically-led about cultures of death and dying). (2) Care givers, Care recipients, Family members and friends of care recipients The introduction of a new form of client-centered approach that explicitly highlights how music can encompass and enhance the whole 'scene of care' will help shift the balance in care settings where music is happening in ways that should empower clients, carers and others involved, drawing to the fore their interests, talents and musical needs and thereby improve quality of care. But all this need sensitizing musicians and music therapists to really attend to how care-receivers themselves 'care for music' and how this can be worked with and extended.  (3) The General Public We aim to increase public empathy with groups of people who are typically sequestered and conceptualized as 'disabled' and lacking social and cultural resources by highlighting 'alternate forms of musical ability and sociability' and the ways in which musicalizing activities associated with 'care' may help to eclipse some of the barriers to shared meaning making in music. Calling attention to the sounds of musical care and to music in scenes of care will help to make those scenes less 'strange' to families and visitors who have loved ones in care facilities. At the same time we aim to raise public awareness of how to use music for wellbeing in daily contexts. (4) Policy makers We will aim to influence policy by contributing new perspectives for thinking about evidence and music's role in scenes of care through briefing documents, website entries and alignment with the All Party Parliamentary Group on Arts/Health as well as with Clinical Commissioning Groups. The aim will be to improve quality of care in care facilities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS003592%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project brings together several cutting edge archaeological research techniques to uncover the biological and social identities of individuals who were treated very differently in death, during the critical transition period preceding the formation of the world's earliest states. This unique opportunity has arisen through archaeological recovery of human remains from the site of Basur Höyük located in the Upper Tigris Valley, a region that has been very important in understanding the large-scale interactions of the first urban polities in Mesopotamia. Sitting astride several important trade routes, the cemetery uncovered at the site provides an insight into the Early Bronze Age period (3100-2800 BC), which follows the withdrawal of Uruk (Southern Mesopotamian) influence from the much larger region but comes before the consolidation of the first urban states at places like Lagash. The changing political and social organisation of this period is not well understood and due to modern conditions, very little is known about the Upper Tigris region. However, recent excavations have revealed a cemetery containing elite burials, evidence of human sacrifice, and a mass death pit; three very different burial contexts which provide the perfect template to examine the changing social roles defined through burial practice.  The introduction of human sacrifice to the region has been argued to reflect the changing function of burial rituals and shifts in social organisation that are firmly linked to the rise of early states and kingship. This project will detail the differences (or similirities) in access to resources, general health, and kin relationships between the burials in the three very different types of grave to outline the social context of these new burial rituals. The project brings together the analysis of bioarchaeological information on the human remains such as childhood health and lifetime stature, disease burden, and cause of death with the analysis of the spatial and social context of each burial. Stable isotope analysis will compare ratios of Carbon, Nitrogen, Strontium, and Oxygen in different individuals and between tissues representing childhood and adulthood in the same individual to address issues of access to resources (e.g. meat) place of origin, and lifetime mobility. An ancient DNA assay will be used to investigate population relationships and test for the presence of pathogen DNA in the death pit. Brought together with a comprehensive 3d reconstruction of each burial, this will form the a uniquely complete picture of a society that has adopted radical burial practices.","This Project will have considerable impact beyond academia. The CO-I (BH) has a demonstrable track record of considerable public engagement and outreach work that will amplify impacts beyond key regional and national heritage and scientific partners. These are outlined below: 1. Policy Makers. The introduction of several new scientific techniques to archaeological research in the region is expected to both highlight the importance of the archaeology of southeastern Turkey within the Turkish Ministry of Culture and also to influence future policy decisions on appropriate research funding and project outcomes.  2. International Organisations. In highlighting the importance of this project, it is expected that several international organizations active in heritage preservation and conservation will take a renewed interest in developing sustainable archaeological practices in the region. The international nature of the research will cement ties between prominent US and UK institutions, between the UK and Turkey through such organizations as the British Academy Overseas Institute in Ankara (BIAA), and provide a template for future collaborations. 3. Commercial and Private Sector. As the main excavations are carried out in advance of construction, this project will allow commercial enterprise to see a demonstrable benefit from responsible corporate behaviour. Smaller local businesses in the region may also benefit form an increase in interest in the site. Currently, there are extensive plans to the Siirt Museum complex into an accessible multi-use site incorporating park space, public facilities such as sports equipment and picknicking areas, and commercial enterprises such as tea rooms and tourism-related shops. 4. Professional and Practitioner Groups. The excavations are active training for new generations of archaeologists, and this project will provide an example of an integrated bioarchaeological practice. This will apply to UK archaeologists and UK students who are integrated into the project through teaching and training activities including through lectures at University College London, training schemes at the Natural History Museum, and practical bioarchaeological fieldwork opportunities in western Turkey at Ege University. Further training and teaching opportunities will apply at the Center for Advanced Isotope Studies in Athens, GA. This project will also provide training for Turkish archaeologists and students in biomolecular archaeology and bioarchaeology, including sampling protocols and research design. This will include a significant number of ethnic minority Turkish students and archaeologists who have strong attachments to the region under study but are traditionally underrepresented in archaeology and in higher education as a whole.  5. Third sector. There is expected to be considerable benefit to third sector parties, particularly museums. The local museum (Batman Muzesi) will benefit from increased outreach components in terms of awareness and interest in collections currently held. The Siirt Museum planned for construction at the completion of the Ilisu Dam project will be dominated by material and activities related to the excavations at Basur Höyük. Training in archaeological sampling methods, research design and additional support in outreach and educational material and activities will be provided to these local museums.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR00353X%2F1

Research Methods: The proposed Research Methods in this initial pilot phase will lay the groundwork for the exploration of the effectiveness and potential of the core Immersive Technology Research Question. Under the guidance of the PI and research team, the pilot project RA will set up a questionnaire to test visitor response to the immersive dimensions of the Culloden, Robert Burns Museum and Bannockburn sites, as well as at the Riverside Museum in Glasgow (which has secured one of the highest -if not the highest-non-traditional museum audience in the UK) and the National Library of Scotland at Kelvin Hall. In parallel, they will set up observations and a focus group round the proposed collections and policy developments at Newhailes by the National Trust for Scotland. These approaches will follow the methodology used by the PI's CDA to evaluate audience response among the 60 000 visitors to the When Glasgow Flourished exhibition in 2014 and by the PI's Beyond Text RA to evaluate responses to the material Burns January exhibition in the Mitchell Library, Glasgow in 2010 and 2011; and by the CI Economou's RA in three different immersive exhibitions in Rome, Athens, and Ename as part of the Marie Curie CHIRON project between 2005-2008 (Economou & Pujol Tost 2011). The project team will identify audience focus groups from the existing visitor and client contact base of the partner organizations, and will explore their visitor experience while also exposing them to new developments in Immersive Experience technology. Consideration will be given to the development of future 'Smart' response evaluations, such as Fitbit and smartphone visitor response monitoring. Immersive experiences are means of 'composing' memory (that is, creating the conditions in which the memories which are publicly expressed are those which are formulated within a range of socially acceptable contexts. In the motorized era, trails have fulfilled the same function of embedding preferred memory narratives, while immersive experiences-delivered in part or whole through the medium of technology-strive to present a fusion of memory, place and performance to create a close and lasting relationship of visitor memory to the experience purchased by the visit. Immersive technologies have (although research on this is not yet developed and its development is a key component of the proposed partnership) arguably similar effects to electronic mass media in the composure of memory, but effects which are possibly delivered in stronger and more lasting terms. We will also work with Soluis as our digital partner, to create a decision-making model for policy and audience development.  Research Context: The research context is that of both the recent rapid growth of the heritage sector, and within that the centrality of cutting edge immersive experiences for tourism, the heritage industry and audience development The development of immersive experiences at 'fantasy' venues such as the London, York, Blackpool and Edinburgh 'Dungeons' from Merlin Entertainments is a connected activity. Some of these visitor experiences are relatively recent, and audience feedback is at an early stage: however, there is some evidence that fully or predominantly CGI immersive experiences such as Bannockburn are less appealing and effective to a comprehensive audience demographic than they are to particular groups.  Research Outputs: Website, a policy paper, a risk assessment, a visualization decision making tool and presentations at the AHRC Showcase, and connected events-e.g. presentations at DH conferences and a media/social media strategy.","Beneficiaries from this research and means by which they might benefit: Who might benefit from this research?  1. The academic and educational community in archaeology, art history, history, heritage and museum studies How might they benefit ? Through the research in audiences, the related methodology developed, and the efficacy/potential of immersive experiences underpinning the policy paper in this area to be published. Research will also be integrated into teaching (including teaching relating to vocational and professional development within the heritage field) at the University of Glasgow, such as the UG Information Studies Digital Media and Information Studies and MSc in Museum Studies, which is taught in Kelvin Hall. The aim would be to incorporate leading edge work into the training and practices of a new generation of researchers and cultural heritage professionals. 2. Local and national government How might they benefit? Through the publication of evidence driven policy documents and through meetings (some already planned) on the importance of right sizing, right scaling and right orienting immersive technology experiences for the future success of visitor attractions and economic growth. 3. The National Trust for Scotland and other heritage, collections and related tourist attractions How might they benefit? Through the publication of evidence-driven research, meetings and in the NTS's case in particular the continuing consultancy of the PI on the right shaping of their future immersive strategy, and a better alignment of digital providers with that strategy. The PI is engaged directly with the NTS's planes for Newhailes, which have been initiated through a £2.4M garden development, including immersive experiences which are being market tested in 2018. 4. Glasgow Museums How might they benefit? Through additional audience research which will support their leading position in pioneering and inclusive audience demographic. 5. Glasgow City Council (now known as Glasgow City Government) How might they benefit? Through evidence supporting their Inclusive Growth strategy for the Creative Economy and the Cultural zone round Kelvin Hall, which is linked to City Deal developments from 2019, combined with PI meetings with Council officials and the leader of the Council, Susan Aitken. 6. The National Library of Scotland How might it benefit? Through evidence evaluating the use of their Moving Image Archive at Kelvin Hall by different audience groups and with respect to the project's engagement with the audience data pertaining to their wider digital strategy, and the two way discussion arising from that. 7. The Immersive Technology related industry.  How might they benefit? Through evidence supporting a better alignment of their work to audience and customer requirements: currently, heritage site immersive redevelopment can be quite 'visionary' and not based on audience needs. This will include contact with immersive technology and creative industry companies in Europe (using for example, CI Economou's partners of the H2020 EMOTIVE project in France, Ireland, and Italy). 8. The media. How might they benefit? The PI will set up a Comms strategy with the University of Glasgow Comms office, to promote a greater understanding of the links between cultural tourism and economic growth more broadly.  9. The general public and the economy. How might it benefit? Through research which underpins higher quality and more appropriately targeted immersive experiences at cultural visitor sites, and a greater awareness of the economic impact and the associated benefits accruing to the economic development of local communities. As an SME with some 90 employees and a global profile, our digital partner Soluis should also benefit.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR009104%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project aims to revolutionize landscape, site, and artefact analyses by bringing new transformative digital recording methods and computed analysis to fields that are traditionally labour intensive. The scale of the resultant technology and capability will generate a paradigm shift in the way that spatial and functional data are studied in heritage sciences. Conventional 'refit analysis' requires an expert to study thousands of individual pieces from prehistoric archaeological sites and try to find pieces that fit together, eventually reconstructing objects, such as stone tool cores. Due to the size and complexity of these sites, it makes them important for understanding past human behaviour, however this also makes them the least understood by archaeologists and the public. The amount of effort this requires increases exponentially with assemblage size and generally entire sites can not be studied. Automation of this process will transform working practices bringing rapid and total surveys in reach of many more projects. The implications of such capability are widespread. At a site and landscape level the addition of digital recording, automated capture and processing to augment landscape survey will enhance the ability to archaeologically record and resolve complex surface scatters in landscapes, this will also allow sites that have previously been too remote and inhospitable to be surveyed.  Work can then be done faster and allow areas for targeted survey to be identified easily and safely. At a macro scale, the method will resolve complex associations facilitating interpretation through visualisations and aiding physical reconstruction. The generation of high fidelity digital output will enable closer working of researchers across traditional boundaries and will benefit the specialist and nonspecialist alike. These combined transformative scalable approaches to refit analysis will have broad application to all disciplines working with objects across the arts and humanities - ranging from three-dimensional artists to heritage professionals such as conservators/ restorers and even impacting on other disciplines such as forensic science. Outputs of the project will be highly visual and are tailored to maximise impact with the involvement of a visual artist as an integral part of the project team. The project teams involved in the various work packages involve high profile international co-investigators.","Heritage practitioners and curators will have immediate benefit through hands on learning and knowledge transfer as a result of attending the project workshop. Small bursaries will be offered to increase the range of those able to attend. The workshop combines a series of short lectures and demonstration of equipment and documentation. There will be a better understanding of the potential for the use of all the developed and used advanced methods and the ways to present their data to a broader audience. The project outputs are aimed at practitioners outside of academia such as curators, object handlers and excavators. The consequence of this will be a better understanding of the value of integrated approaches of analysis across archaeology and refit, microwear and landscape imaging as interpretive tools. This crosses over to a gained understanding of the complexity of site scale and the importance of artefact context and embedded data. This will improve communication between curators, heritage specialists, and researchers about the best practices for conservation and analysis of material to study site activities and function. The methods developed and under investigation are capable of producing images of high quality that illustrate clusters of tools, how these fit together to understand activity areas and locations of production, and wear from tool use on early prehistoric implements. The effect of visualising this allows data to be communicated to a wide audience. This presents opportunities for museums to display high quality images of tools in a way that is unprecedented and useful for public engagement. The nature of these images means that they can be appreciated as they are. Direct observation of wear is the only current way to adequately showcase its features to the public, this situation changes with the presentation of the high resolution, high depth images produced by laser scanning systems. The surfaces can be visualised as a sort of 3D landscape and displayed in interactive systems, moving beyond a simple digital photograph. The integration of 3D data at multiple scales producing zoomable interactive models and the ability to digitally fit artefacts from across sites together will create a grand experience. This extends to the media whereby the quality of the output from such systems is far more suitable for the needs of print. The quality of data. High quality data in archaeology leads to high quality interpretations and a better understanding of the archaeological record and, in this case early prehistoric archaeology. The impact to society is that the research forms the basis of good method that has the onward impact of producing a quality interpretation and presentation of heritage, early prehistoric life, and human evolution to the public. The development of interactive high quality experiences on the web would provide an understanding of the sites and artifacts that can be shared with the public. Crowd sourced high resolution images of fossiliferous deposits would provide a unique opportunity for citizen science. Downloadable files for use with low cost 3D printers, will also provide an innovative pathway to engage with the public and provide a tactile approach to present heritage.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL00688X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Curious Travellers Project will collect, present and analyse a significant body of material relating to the phenomenon of the Welsh and Scottish Tour as it developed in the years c.1760-1815. It will open a window onto the vivid and often entertaining accounts of scores of 'curious travellers' who headed for the peripheries of Britain in search of the primitive, the picturesque and the sublime - and often found the foreign, and the unsettling, surprisingly close to home. Our starting point is the work of naturalist and antiquarian Thomas Pennant of Downing (1726-1798), whose pioneering tours in Scotland and Wales (1771-1781) were widely read, directly inspiring the Highland journey of Johnson and Boswell and hundreds of others. His 'omnivorous' style, drawing on information from an imposing network of correspondents, weaves together natural history, antiquarianism, literature, history, aesthetics and politics. Often cited as an authority or an influence, Pennant's work has received little attention in its own right: the archive is scattered and difficult to use. The first aim of the project is to catalogue the many hundreds of letters to and from Pennant, and present them in a searchable data-base. This tool will improve our knowledge of the antiquarian, scientific and literary networks of the period, and allow us to trace both Pennant's careful preparation and information gathering, and the complex development of the composite and much-revised texts of the Tours themselves. The 'transperipheral' nature of Pennant's Tours (as a Welshman, albeit with unionist sympathies, exploring Scotland and his native Wales), along with their importance to later writers and travellers, make them an ideal point from which to investigate travel-writing from Wales and Scotland after 1760, when an improved transport infrastructure and a new sense of British identity inspired an increasingly affluent middle class to explore their national peripheries. Hundreds of published and manuscript accounts of tourist experiences form a still largely untapped resource for the study of history, material culture, literature and language. The second aim of the project is to make a generous selection of unpublished Tours of Wales and Scotland available online, each with a short contextualizing introduction and linked to a series of maps and pictures.  In the light of recent work on global exploration in this period (Cook's Pacific voyages; the travels of Joseph Banks) the parallel 'exploration' of Britain needs critical reassessment. The domestic tour was an extraordinarily successful genre, second only to novels and romances, but has been relatively little studied. Yet it arguably played an important role in the construction of national histories, both at a 'four nations' level, and in a larger British context. Travel-writing uncovered the past in the landscape, through sites (cromlechs, churches, castles) popular culture (language, costume, song, and 'national character'), objects and images (antiquities, landscapes). Because landscape-writing and antiquarianism are often seen as conservative forms, the politics of the tour as a genre in this period is rarely considered. How far, during a period of revolution and war, did native histories, and the Celtic languages, disrupt that larger narrative of Britishness and of national 'improvement'? Pennant's Tours, for example, despite his unionist stance, were readily absorbed into nationalist discourses in both Wales and Scotland. In considering how the tour genre helped to 'create' versions of British history, the project will examine travellers' engagement with vernacular Celtic cultures (poetry and song), and ask how far their perceptions were influenced by contemporary ideas from science and art.  Besides producing two new electronic resources, we will explore these issues through an informative dynamic website, 2 monographs, articles, a volume of essays, conferences, events and exhibitions.","Research into the Welsh and Scottish Tour has the potential to impact on a range of organisations in the heritage, education and tourism sectors of both countries. The project has been developed in consultation with representatives from many of these groups, and a range of events is planned to disseminate our research to various different audiences. Because the topic is so closely linked to matters of place, landscape and heritage, we envisage that many more opportunities will come up as the work progresses. Heritage: Museums and Galleries. Our 'book-end' conferences in 2014 and 2018 are linked into two major international exhibitions and will benefit from the wider publicity surrounding them. The first, in National Museum of Wales, Cardiff, explores visual aspects of the Tours in conjunction with an exhibition of the landscape painter Richard Wilson. The second, celebrating the tercentenary of Scotland's oldest museum, the Hunterian in Glasgow, will explore material culture and antiquities. Both exhibitions are supported by the Paul Mellon Foundation at Yale, and thus have an international dimension. Further smaller exhibitions focused on the manuscript tours are planned with both the National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales, to coincide with further day-conferences. A day event with schools is planned in Ceredigion Museum for 2015 (see below). In conjunction with NLW, additional funding will be sought towards a touring exhibition in 2019, to celebrate the work of Thomas Pennant's principal artist, Moses Griffith. Education: Schools, further education. A joint event hosted by Ceredigion Museum will focus on the theme of 'travel in the olden days' for primary schools; this will include reading, exploring objects, and competitions for creative writing and drawing. We will also develop sections of the Curious Travellers Website in consultation with Dr Paul Evans (Deputy Head, Denbigh High) to provide resources for the secondary-level history curriculum: these will be available in both Welsh and English. In the sphere of adult education, we will contribute to the lively programmes of talks and walks organized by local history societies: we have strong links with the Thomas Pennant Society and the Edward Llwyd Society, and have an event planned with the former. The website will be freely accessible to the general public, who will benefit from access to the new research tools: the database of Pennant Correspondence, and the searchable online corpus of Welsh & Scottish Tours. When publicizing our work in the university sector, we will ensure that the site is made known to the Open University; U3A etc.  Tourism:  Pennant's quotability is nicely exemplified by the large hoarding greeting arrivals at Edinburgh Airport with his generous description of that city: 'It possesses a boldness and grandeur beyond that I have ever seen'. Naturally enough, this project presents abundant possibilities for exploring the history of tourism in Wales and Scotland, from the provision of site-specific material to an understanding of the development of tourist itineraries, and of changing expectations. We have had enthusiastic responses from bodies including Visit Scotland, Visit Wales, CADW, the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments and National Trust for Scotland. Our Creative Responses strand, which will see contemporary artists and writers retracing parts of Pennant's Tours, may be further used to enhance the tourist experience in certain places.  Media Constantine is currently scripting a half-hour programme on the 'Welsh Tour' for BBC Radio Wales, which will raise the profile of the subject; we are also developing a pitch for a three-episode television series aimed at BBC4, using the Curious Travellers title. BBC Radio Scotland are interested in following one of the Creative Responses tours. We will use the website to publicize and blog our various events as they happen.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL009463%2F1

We propose a project to bring together a network of community, university and heritage sector researchers to investigate the late medieval and early modern archaeological heritage of Colonsay in Argyll, and to research the social learning processes this entails. Co-producing heritage knowledge in this way will enhance the learning capacity and sustainability of the island community and contribute to understanding of the heritage and sustainability link. Colonsay was once the centre of a maritime kingdom associated with the Lord of the Isles and has a unique cultural heritage that is little explored. Today it is one of Scotland's most remote and fragile communities. While there is considerable local interest in developing the heritage of the island, financial and human resource capacity is limited and there is a clear need for initiatives to enhance community capacity to ensure the island is self-sustaining and resilient to future challenges. Working closely with community partners we will run a programme of community-based learning and knowledge exchange in archaeological and landscape survey field methodologies. This will include a detailed desk-based assessment of documentary, cartographic and illustrative resources; a detailed programme of landscape survey, and an archaeological investigation of a number of targeted sites. Key outcomes will include a cultural landscape archive to generate an online resource and a physical community mounted exhibition, and enhanced community capacity to access future community heritage funding. A parallel qualitative research study of social learning will develop evaluative and theoretical frameworks to link heritage social learning to enhance adaptive capacity and resilience. This rich co-production process will add significantly to understanding of the late medieval early modern archaeology of the region; create a valuable community heritage resource to contribute to future community-led heritage tourism projects; and, enhance community learning capacity and understanding of heritage and sustainability.","The project will be developed in partnership with the local community and as a result relationships have already been established with interested parties. An initial archaeological dig was undertaken at Dun Cholla on 18th June 2012 and involved the local primary school and community stakeholders. Community representatives from Colonsay were also involved in a workshop weekend organised by University of Ulster in Kilmartin in September 2012. This brought representatives from groups involved in the earlier Phase 1 AHRC Connecting Communities (CC) call (Millstrand Primary, Portrush; Bushmills Folklore and History Group; Ballintoy Historical Society and Tayvallich Primary School, Argyll) together to discuss their work and build a stronger network for future participation. It is envisaged that this network of community groups (currently funded through All Our Stories-AOS) will integrate into this proposed project and participate in its fieldwork and workshop programme. Having previously established this network enables the immediate integration of the projects and expands the potential impact of both. The primary beneficiaries of this project will be the Colonsay and Oransay community as the project is designed to significantly enhance their understanding of the built cultural heritage of the island and allow them to develop their own capacity to investigate their past landscape histories. This project will provide an excellent training environment not only for the local community but for Queens University Students who will benefit through their involvement in archaeological investigation and geophysical survey fieldwork. Both groups will be able to gain practical experience in landscape survey techniques, archaeological excavation and interpretation of heritage sites. Such an intensive project will serve as an exemplar of how a landscape and community-specific project will operate, providing a model of best practice for other communities to learn from. Little is known about the historical archaeologies of this whole region with few investigations having taken place to date. This work will significantly enhance our understandings of the later historical period in Colonsay and it is envisaged that the programme of project activities and training will result in the production of a cultural heritage archive. This archive coupled with enhanced community capacity can facilitate the continuation of heritage focused activities on Colonsay thereby providing an enhanced attraction for visitors, promoting sustainable heritage tourism and contributing to regeneration and economic development of Colonsay. Letters of support for the project are included from the Colonsay and Oransay Heritage Trust (COHT), Colonsay Estate, Colonsay Development Company, Colonsay Primary School and Kilmartin House Museum The Colonsay and Oransay community will also benefit through the production of a co-authored monograph and poster display based on the research undertaken during the project. This will bring together archaeological, heritage, social science, geographic and lay expertise and build on the approach of working 'with' communities. The broader academic community will benefit through the dissemination of academic research papers across the archaeological community and in the production of analytical frameworks to assess social learning for heritage knowledge co-production and enhanced adaptive capacity.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007785%2F1

This will allow us to generate significant new, and previously unanticipated, impact at three levels: within communities of vulnerable deaf children across Ekurhuleni, South Africa, within the agencies that support these young people, and at child-welfare and protection policy-level, working nationally in South Africa with the Department of Social Development and internationally with the UN, the EU and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).  Changing the Story has interrogated how CSOs across 12 LMICs have sought to address the issue of youth engagement, looking at the ways in which arts-based programming, in particular, can be designed to foster better youth-ownership of development outcomes. We have commissioned and evaluated 21 youth-designed and youth-led projects that have sought to amplify the voices of young people to effect change in a wide range of contexts and at a number of levels. In Zimbabwe, for example, we worked with young street artists to advocate for human rights of the minority Tonga community, in South Africa we have used participatory filmmaking to raise awareness of (inter alia) the plight of the 'undocumented' children of illegal migrants, or of gender-based violence, focussing on questions of youth voice, or in Rwanda we have used grass-roots, participatory practices to shape the national curriculum.  Our research has sought to innovative CSO practice in two ways. On the one hand, we have explored youth-led participatory methodologies, highlighting the importance of taking a situated approach to cultural production, emphasizing the relationship between artistic product and social context. This is often ignored in participatory projects that tend to focus far more on the process of engagement itself, and in so doing often ignore a key motivation for participation. On the other, our work highlights the structural implications of participation. While the notion of engaging young people in project design is increasingly common place, Changing the Story has emphasized making programmes fundamentally accountable to young people. This is more unusual in development projects, where accountability to the funder generally remains the priority. Thus, our project has contributed to the growing literature on 'downward accountability' and the ways in which supporting young people to shape organisational practice can not only improve development outcomes and increase value for money, but also overcome the much discussed phenomenon of 'donor fatigue' (Waddington 2020). Examples from our research of particular relevance to this present proposal include 'youth-led community assessments', piloted by a number of the Changing the Story projects and used to facilitate dialogue between CSOs, the young people they support and wider stakeholders in order to hold CSOs to account for the services they provide.  In proposed project we will: 1) Foster integration of deaf children and develop their self-advocacy skills. We will revisit learning from our earlier work in South Africa in order to create an arts-based leadership programme in partnership with Hope and Homes for Children (HHC), DeafKidz International (DKI), Deaf SA and the Bishop Simeon Trust (BST). 2) Support relevant agencies to develop more inclusive practices. Working in partnership with DKI and Deaf SA, we will help BST and HHC to build organisational capacity. The project will provide them with new skills, and new approaches to programme design, helping them to integrate and support deaf children more effectively across their programmes. 3) Support youth-led South-South knowledge exchange to inform child-welfare and protection policy nationally and internationally.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV011626%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The rapid growth of English as a global language masks an equally rapid growth in the extent to which modern business settings have become increasingly multilingual. This has long been the case in multinational companies (MNCs), but large scale migration over the last decade means that many domestic businesses employ a significant number of workers whose first language is not English. Because of the assumption that 'everyone speaks English' many firms do not resort to using professional translators/interpreters, addressing their translation needs through existing staff who happen to be bilingual (or multilingual) or possess language skills. These non-professional translators and interpreters (NPTIs) find themselves called upon to translate or interpret, often by their employers, but also by their colleagues.  The particular contribution of NPTIs has only recently been acknowledged by academic and practitioner communities. This is because they are 'normal' employees, workers or service providers, whose central community-building role goes unnoticed. Their roles as mediating agents and cultural bridge builders makes them central to knowledge transfer between different business and knowledge communities and entails much more than the mechanical replacement of words from one language with those of another. In acting as link persons 'betwixt and between' different linguistic, cultural and historical-political life worlds, their roles are complex and conflicted as they endeavour to align the sometimes different expectations, values and perspectives of the communities they aim to link. Within multilingual business contexts their role has been highlighted as important to knowledge transfer, yet there is no understanding of how and why they enact their roles in particular ways or what enables them to 'build bridges' and create mutual intelligibility between different constituencies (e.g. between seasonal workers who often do not speak English and their employing organisations; between MNC Headquarters and their subsidiaries and the local constituencies they represent or serve; or key supply chain constituencies, who frequently do not speak English at advanced levels).  The Research Network explores the work of NPTIs in multilingual business and entrepreneurial communities, drawing on the perspectives of different groups including non-English speaking seasonal workforces, the suppliers of translation/interpretation services, their entrepreneur and business users, as well as the voices of the non-professional translators and interpreters themselves. The proposed Network will be built upon four events, of which the last will be a dramatised performance of the collected stories, voices and perspectives, developed in collaboration with a community theatre and presented to the communities involved.  The Network brings together established and early career academics from two currently separate disciplinary fields: Translation Studies and International Business/Management Studies. Scholars in both disciplines have taken a recent interest in NPTIs as linguistic, cultural and political agents; yet there is no exchange between these fields and their approaches. The Network is the first initiative to unite these disciplines: methods from arts and humanities and social sciences will be brought to bear on the events associated with the Network. Speakers and contributors include not only academics, but also NPTIs themselves, service providers of language/translation services and involving the active and on-going contribution of a community theatre (New Vic Borderlines), which has developed expertise in academic, pedagogic and artistic approaches with a view to developing collaboratively articulated research agendas, where multiple stakeholders ask questions relevant to the communities and constituencies they represent and serve. The main aim of the Network is to articulate such an agenda, focusing on the work of NPTIs.","Apart from the academic beneficiaries, there are a number of user or provider beneficiaries which are included in the proposed Network and who will benefit from its work during and beyond its existence. The non-professional translators/interpreters themselves: this group is currently unconnected, unaware of its power and the demands made on individuals. There is no practitioner or academic body that represents their work and aligns individuals into a coherent community of language practice. Although there have been relatively few empirical studies, the evidence that has been gathered shows non-professional translators/interpreters in work-contexts that are central to organisational efficiency yet also insists that they are unacknowledged actors who are frequently overworked and marginalised. In creating a platform for the initial articulation of their work, the challenges it brings and indeed their very existence within multinational companies, this group will benefit from being given a voice, which may in turn lead to an increased sense of professional and personal 'worth' and well-being in their respective work-based settings. The providers of translation/interpretation services increasingly draw on the expertise of non-professional translators/interpreters, yet they struggle to understand the particularities of their work, the challenges they face and the training and support they may need. This group of users, will benefit from increased understanding of the collective training and support needs of a part of the workforce they increasingly engage with. Businesses operating in multilingual contexts (both domestic and international) will increase their understanding of the complexities of translation/interpretation work and will thus be enabled to engage with their respective stakeholders (be they internal, i.e. multilingual workforces, or external, i.e. international supply chains; external markets) more effectively. This will be achieved through the development of their communicative sensitivities, which include awareness of the role of the English language (as the main language of business) and its relationship with 'other languages' and the need for translation. Decision-makers and policy makers, e.g. as positioned both regionally in the UK and internationally, have been included in the Network as they have little information about the complexities and dilemmas that non-professional translators/interpreters face in their daily interactions. Providing such intelligence directly from the providers of these services will enable decision/policy makers to integrate these perspectives into their strategic planning and thereby render them more sensitive to local/regional contexts. Wider multilingual entrepreneurial/business and other communities: the Network is located within Keele University's 'Cultural Animation and Social Innovation Centre', a centre dedicated to formulating and executing collaboratively articulated research agendas. It has extensive outreach capabilities into local, regional and international communities and these will be benefit from the proposed Network as multilingual/translation aspects also shape many of their communicative practices and inform how and whether they become interlinked. In highlighting the work of these linking agents, the communities will gain insight into the very process of networking across communities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP007228%2F1

Despite this, the idea of indigenous extinction is persistent. Archaeology and archaeologists are implicated in this narrative due to an insistence on the pre-Columbian past as dead and preserved in archaeological museum collections. We acknowledge this critique and the need to respond with positive action to 1) engage those outside the discipline, and 2) answer to the critical question for archaeologists in the 21st century: ""Archaeology for whom?"" (Atalay et al. 2014 citing Nalda 1978).  Therefore, the central aim of the proposed activities is to address the separation between the academy and communities in the Caribbean on the themes of archaeology and indigenous identity and representation. The proposed network draws together institutional and non-institutional partners from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, neighbouring islands which share precolonial and colonial histories but with distinctive modern trajectories. We will open up a space to explore issues through a series of focused meetings involving academic partners and non-academic stakeholders. We will address the different contexts of engagement (and non-engagement) with Indigenous archaeology and indigeneity in the present. We will do this by holding meetings in sites and in the presence of objects of mutual interest such as at rockart locations and in museum storerooms to generate non-hierarchical dialogue on locally-specific issues around heritage and representation. This is needed to inform the practise of archaeology itself from the initial research design, questions asked, participants, and methods.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX003299%2F1

AD 790-1350), through an interdisciplinary approach using archaeological, written and toponymic evidence and address the overarching questions of connectivity and communication in Norse Scotland. The term 'maritime cultural landscape' was originally coined by Norwegian archaeologists Christer Westerdahl to denote 'the unity of remnants of maritime culture on land as well as underwater'. This formed part of his ground-breaking analytical framework developed for the Bothnian/Baltic area and which has been successfully applied in Scandinavia, Germany and the North Atlantic. This concept is virtually unexplored for Scandinavian Scotland, despite being equally applicable to this area. By bringing this innovative research framework combined with archaeological and geophysical fieldwork to Scotland, this project will generate new data on maritime culture and enable important study of this geographic area from a whole new perspective. The project will build on three main strands of research: existing research on the Norse settlement of Scandinavian Scotland, smaller research initiatives focusing on maritime Scotland, as well as research on maritime cultural landscape from Germany, Scandinavia and the wider North Atlantic.  The research will be carried out through three work packages. The first one encompasses a PhD project entitled Norse harbours in the west of Scotland for which a number of Norse landing places in Scotland will be identified and examined through geophysical survey and targeted excavation. In the second work package The Norse in the North and West of Scotland: settlements and the sea - the toponymic evidence, a PDRA and project partners will examine place-names to provide insight into maritime travel and harbours in Scandinavian Scotland. Data will also be drawn from oral traditions through study of local folklore and interviews with local people, as such traditions are still strong in rural Scotland. In the third work package Travel and communication in Scandinavian Scotland and the wider North Atlantic an overarching view of the maritime cultural landscape as well as travel and communication will be created through detailed analysis of Norse archaeological remains and landscape study. All in all, the project will provide a whole new view of Scandinavian Scotland.  The project results will be presented at workshops and conferences as well as a range of publications and a website.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW010763%2F1

Within the broader structures of the art market 'antiques' remains an immensely popular subject, with TV programmes such as the 'Antiques Roadshow' regularly in the top viewing figures and one cannot ignore the scores of other programmes from 'Bargain Hunt' to 'Lovejoy' that reveal, and mythologise, the practices of the antique trade and the figure of the antique dealer. And yet the history of the antique trade, an awareness of its practices, and a clear understanding of the role of the antique trade in the complex and shifting landscape of our fascination with antiques remains an obscure and little understood cultural phenomenon. In the museum world, the history of antique dealers in the biography of museum objects has often been supressed or dislocated from the interpretation of museum objects in the public domain. The proposed 'Year of the Dealer' project aims to direct renewed attention to the history of the antique trade in the development of public museums and the significance of the antique trade in British cultural life.   The project is based on the AHRC research project 'Antique Dealers: the British Antique Trade in the 20th century, a cultural geography' (2013-2016) and draws on the rich research resources that the project assembled, including 36 oral history interviews (more than 100 hours of archive), 8 major dealer archives and an active community of more than 30 volunteers working on data input into the project websites and on cataloguing and conservation of dealer archives. The 'Year of the Dealer' aims to co-produce innovative museum interpretation materials, to engage stakeholders in the themes that have emerged as a result of the research project and to disseminate and embed key research findings in the wider public domain. We aim to reveal the potential for new and previously hidden stories to be told about world-renowned and familiar museum objects and to demonstrate the potential for the adoption of the new narratives in public museum interpretation on a national and international scale.   Over the course of one year the project team and the well established community of project volunteers will work in collaboration with 6 national and regional museums (The V&A, National Museum, Scotland, The Ashmolean Museum, The Lady Lever Art Gallery, The Bowes Museum, and Temple Newsam), a university art gallery, a community theatre and a leading antique dealer business to deliver an innovative programme of museum interpretation interventions, exhibitions, workshops and public events, training workshops and a high profile theatre performance.   The project outcomes will include 6 individual 'hidden history' trails of up to 20 objects in the collections of major museum partners; a series of 4 individually designed workshops based on key questions that have emerged on the relationships between museums and the art market, co-produced with museum partners; a series of 3 public engagement 'In Conversation' events at 3 of the partner museums; staff and volunteer training workshops at each partner museum; a small-scale 3 month exhibition reuniting dealer archives with museum objects and an associated archives workshop; a high-profile, public performance of the play 'Quinneys', led by student actors and directed by a leading academic in theatre directing; an associated participatory workshop, led by a leading academic in theatre and performance; both play and workshop foreground themes of which are central to the construction of the social and cultural identity of the antique dealer.  This rich series of activities, managed and disseminated through a dedicated project website, aims to facilitate a permanent shift in the potential for new interpretations of public museum objects and engage a variety of stakeholders and the public in the results of the research project","The Year of the Dealer project aims to inculcate a permanent shift in the interpretation of objects in public museums and to engage museums, the public and art market professionals with the significance of the history of the antique trade in Britian. The project has considerable support from collaborating partner organisations, more than £63,000 of 'In-Kind' support, which is a testament to the value that they have assigned to the project. We have consulted closely with all our partners to develop the programme of activities and events.  The Key Impact Beneficiaries will be: 1. Partner Museum staff, who will be better informed about the history of the antique trade in Britain and the history and significance of dealers associated with their respective museums; enhanced resources for object interpretations will enable new narratives for well-known museum objects; co-production will enhance cross-institutional dialogue with and between national and regional museums; the workshops will enable shared perspectives from stakeholders.  2. The General Public, who will have an enhanced visitor experience in the 6 partner museums through the 'hidden history' trails; enhanced engagement as participants in the 'In Conversation' events staged at 3 public museum venues and via restaging the play 'Quinneys' and associated workshop. 3. The professional British antique trade, whose business will benefit from increased exposure of their history; discussion and dialogue with museum professionals, academics, students and the public will enable shared perspectives. 4. Museum volunteer communities and University student volunteers at UG, TPG and PGR levels, through enhanced engagement with a key research project and through skills training on research impact capture and evaluation and mentoring opportunities. 5. Theatre professionals, theatre and performance students, through enhanced creative practice and expertise in theatre performance. 6. Academic staff, who will benefit from the collaborative dialogue with a wide range of partners from the museum world, the performance and theatre world, the art business world and the general public.  Our approach to Impact is to embed continual assessment and impact data capture as an integral part of the project. Impact will be developed, monitored, recorded, assessed, and archived by PI/CI and museum-based admin post and our small team of trained volunteer researchers (travel and subsistence for up to 4 UG/PG volunteers is part of the funding bid). We aim to undertake interviews, develop online surveys embedded in the project website, and run focus group sessions with key stakeholders at various points in the project. All activities will conform to university ethical code of practice for research procedures and requirements. Specialist training in surveys, focus groups and interviews are already part of the existing research team and will be made available to the impact capture volunteers. Our partner organisations may also run their own museum visitor surveys to assess the effectiveness of the proposed museum trails and the performance of 'Quinney's' and the associated workshop at Bowes Museum; such information will be made available to the project. We plan to record specific events for podcasts, hosted by the project website - the 'In Conversation' events; the re-staging of 'Quinneys'; aspects of the 'Dealing with Authenticity' workshop, to ensure enhanced dissemination and public engagement with the project and to allow impact to endure beyond the events themselves. A dissemination plan for national publicity and public engagement is being developed with key organisations such as the British Antique Dealers' Association (BADA), The Antique Dealers' Association (LAPADA), The International Antique Dealers Association (CINOA) and with project media partners such as Apollo Magazine and The Art Newspaper; the 'SOLD!' exhibition at Bowes Museum will aggregate and amplify media attention.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS00808X%2F1

It is supported by Creative Scotland, Aberdeen City Council, Dundee City Council, The City of Edinburgh Council and Glasgow City Council and its services are delivered in partnership with the Business Gateway network. The CEO undertakes a wide range of activities in support of cultural micro-businesses. In line with the EU's definition, 'Micro enterprises are defined as enterprises which employ fewer than 10 people and whose annual turnover or annual balance sheet total does not exceed 2 million euro'. The areas it covers - using specialist advisers - are: digital development, equalities, finance, taxation, human resources, legal affairs, press and publicity, property, marketing and retail. These services are provided for the following creative sectors: community arts, dance, design, fashion and textiles, film, games and apps, literature, music, performance, product design and photography, screen industries and animation, TV and digital media and visual arts.   In recognition of the value that this project will contribute, the CEO's chair and director have offered unrestricted access for research. The organisation wishes to reflect on a decade's work and to make its exceptionally rich database of relations with a wide range of clients across a gamut of cultural practices available for analysis with a view to increasing the CEO's effectiveness and its understanding of the tacit and implicit knowledge that is used in dealing with clients. The research team will offer real time analysis of interactions between clients and the CEO's executive and advisory teams to assess areas of success and those that might be improved. The research will therefore constitute an unprecedented analysis of the workings of a cultural support body and how it engages in knowledge exchange in the creative economy. At the same time, because the research will add very significant new analysis to the CEO's knowledge base, it also exemplifies how academics can engage in highly constructive KE with a cultural support body.  Through the methods outlined below, this study will aim to understand the funding and policy environment in which the CEO operates and how this is translated into its internal imperatives and how these in turn shape relations with clients. The research team will also seek to understand how clients approach the CEO for advice, how this relates to other sources of advice that they might pursue, and how - through case studies - that advice shapes (or does not shape) the development of cultural enterprises. This project constitutes an exceptional and timely opportunity to undertake a full-scale case study that scrutinises how contemporary policy is understood and implemented institutionally and organisationally by a publicly funded cultural agency.  The research will examine the objectives pursued by the CEO; how it fulfils its objectives; and ask what strategic lessons may be drawn from its overall experience. The principal data-gathering techniques include the assessment of documents and texts, analyses of a rich holding of data on clients, archival research, and interviews with board members, staff, advisers, clients and other key policy actors, to all of whom the project team are confident of achieving excellent access. The PI (Schlesinger) and Co-I (Selfe) bring multi-disciplinary expertise in sociological, historical, archival, creative economy and policy analysis.","Who will benefit? Non-academic beneficiaries will include the Scottish and UK Governments, policy-makers, and agencies and other support bodies concerned with culture broadly understood at devolved, UK and international levels. In addition, the project is intended to benefit creative micro-businesses.  How will they benefit? By improving knowledge exchange, the proposed study will increase the effectiveness of public policy and thus help foster an improved economic performance on the part of cultural enterprises. While there is considerable awareness of the problems facing SMEs, the lack of sustainability of cultural micro-businesses has not to date been a pressing concern for policy-makers and support bodies in the UK. The CEO has now raised this as a new policy issue in Scotland. The research will track the impact of the ensuing debate and produce relevant evidence.  More generally, knowledge generated about the experience and performance of the CEO will contribute towards a more informed understanding of how public agendas for support of creative industries can best be implemented. Policy-makers will benefit from enhanced knowledge about the efficacy of organisational cultures and practices within public bodies dedicated to cultural enterprise, the effectiveness of specific support initiatives, as well as the strategic role that frameworks of public support can play. Improved knowledge in these areas is expected to contribute to a more informed, evidence-based approach to the design of strategies intended to support cultural enterprises at regional, national and international level. By contributing to improved knowledge exchange, the project aims to foster a strengthened policy environment, and thus to improve the ability of cultural businesses to achieve creative and commercial success. How will engagement and benefit be ensured? The project team will work in partnership with the CEO to establish contact and forge new links with the wide range of cultural businesses that come within its orbit. Along with the policy-making and advisory bodies to which the CEO relates (the Scottish Government, Creative Scotland, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others) the project aims to create a network of stakeholders. Regular communication and exchange will be conducted. The project team will foster dialogue with target users via participation in consultations and public debate during the research period. Seminars held at the University of Glasgow's Centre for Cultural Policy Research and at the new AHRC-funded Centre for Copyright and New Business Models in the Creative Economy (CREATe), which is headquartered at Glasgow University, will be used to ensure productive engagement with target users. Engagement will also be fostered through targeted attendance at conferences and industry meetings, and an End of Project symposium. This event will bring together policy makers, support agencies, creatives and academics and also have an international dimension. Further benefit will result from the publication of the project's findings for the range of interested audiences following its conclusion.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK002570%2F1

The timeliness and significance of this question is evidenced by the current and forthcoming centenaries which are the focus of the research. From the recent commemoration of suffrage, revolution and the sinking of the Titanic, to the world-wide events of the First World War, this project places contemporary centenary events in the context of historical celebrations and commemorations in order to interrogate exactly who is now remembering for whom, and how.  Calls for centennial commemoration and celebration are often met by claims that the time for such activity has passed - particularly as there are no longer any living witnesses - and claims that it is more appropriate to focus on the present and future. Yet, these events continue to have significance for the families and communities involved. As those tasked with caring for the future, museums and heritage sites are at the centre of negotiating these controversial, and very public, issues. This timely, interdisciplinary, cross-sector project works to contextualise, compare and convey the significance of the centenary and to support museums and heritage sites to embed robust ways of negotiating these commemorations. The proposal will bring together academics, early career researchers, doctoral students, curators, and educators to work in a genuinely interdisciplinary way. The diversity of expertise within the network will facilitate a focus on different cultural conceptions and manifestations of centenary activity. The findings will be of significance for museum and heritage site professionals and educators across the sectors.  The project will involve four workshops at the University of Birmingham, the University of Sheffield, the Historic Royal Palaces Tower of London, and Cardiff University. These meetings will be structured to promote dialogue, collaboration and progression of the fields. The project steering group will maintain a website and blog throughout its duration to strengthen the exchange of ideas, report back on the workshops, maintain the impetus beyond the life of the initial project, and attract interest more widely from the constituencies of the members. In addition to the website and blog, the steering group will disseminate results via a film, a conference paper, and a co-authored article.","1. Museum and Heritage Site Professionals: One aspiration is that the project will feed into and hopefully influence current practice through dissemination within the professional sector. There are many active networks within the field of heritage interpretation and education who would be interested in the results of the research. Museum and heritage site professionals within the Museums Association, the Social History Curators' Group, the Group for Education in Museums, the Historical Association, the International Museum Theatre Alliance, the International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience, and The International Council of Museums, Committee For Education and Cultural Action will be informed of the outcomes of the network via the website, blog and existing email lists. Increasing awareness, building confidence and providing knowledge exchange about centennial commemorations may play an important contribution within this sector. 2. Policy Makers: Steering Committee member, Sam Cairns, manages the Cultural Learning Alliance with 8,000 members, drawing together key evidence, expertise and critical mass to influence policy makers in the Department for Education and Department of Culture, Media, and Sport. Given the significant investment of time and public funds into centennial activities, the insights generated by this project may help to highlight and navigate some of the ethical, political and social issues raised by centennial commemoration and/or celebration. 3. Educational programmers: Findings of the research will be incredibly useful for helping educators (in museums and in formal education outlets) think about and deal with issues of centenary commemoration within education programmes. Such issues are at the heart of questions of identity and community. Centennial celebrations can play an important role in regional, national and transnational cohesion and well-being but they can also prove divisive and contentious. Highlighting divergent expectations and purposes of such celebrations for different groups will be a key element of this project. The focus of this project is, by its very nature, wide in its temporal scope: it casts its gaze on events from long ago but at the same time there are immediate and continuing opportunities to see the impact of the project on current centenial activity and on work for the immediate and more distant future.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK005413%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Greater awareness of the diversity of British history has grown in recent years following the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement, captured in BBC series such as David Olusoga's Black and British: A Forgotten History (BBC Two, 2016). Yet the role played by Black women in shaping twentieth-century British society, and its relationship to the media, still remains too often hidden or overlooked. Reclaiming a Lost Past challenges this invisibility by encouraging public engagement with two important and contrasting strands related to the Black British female struggle for visible representation in mainstream media and society from the 1960s onwards. The first connects to pioneering Black actresses seen and heard by mass audiences on BBC TV and on BBC Radio; the second to Black feminist activist politics and women's liberation as mediated by the BBC.  These strands reveal two very different sides to the BBC's relationship to Black British women in the second half of the twentieth century (and into the twenty-first). Black actresses were amongst the first to embody, through mass media, the new contours of British national identity following mass migration from Britain's former colonies. Indeed, mainstream BBC programming from the 1960s onwards offered a hyper-visibility to those actresses cast in popular shows such as the sitcom Till Death Us Do Part (Valerie Murray) or the science fiction show Blake's Seven (Josette Simon). This hyper-visibility broke new ground in terms of showcasing the creative reach of Black British female performers at a time of widespread racism and sexism. But so too did it bring challenges: of being thrust into the spotlight, of bearing a burden of representation and of navigating the territory of being typecast or playing against type in certain roles. Meanwhile for Black British feminists from the 1970s onwards, when the fight against sexism and racism grew rapidly as a political force in the UK, the story was largely one of invisibility. As women's equality took hold, Black feminist voices and faces, and their ideas on women's liberation (shaped by the experiences of racism as much as misogyny), were often left out of mass media programming on female equality, including at the BBC. It was mostly not until decades later, in the 1990s and 2000s, when young Black female BBC producers finally began to bring to air the contribution of pioneering feminists including Stella Dadzie and Gail Lewis.  Reclaiming a Lost Past move these stories from the margins of public understandings of the BBC's history to centre stage. This project encourages a range of distinct demographics, particularly Black British women of different generations, to engage with the lesser told 'herstories' of Black feminist activism and of Black actresses in Britain - as told through artefacts from the BBC's archives and through profiles of key trailblazing figures - and to explore some of the complexities of how the BBC dealt with the promotion of race and gender equality. In collaboration with three community-oriented partners - the Young Vic Theatre in London, the podcast Letter to a Black Girl and the Feminist Library in London - the project will both spark and deliver dialogue, discussion and educational outreach across three varying age groups and constituencies. This will be done through curriculum and extra-curricular activities for Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4 in two South London schools, via podcast makers and audiences comprised of Black British women aged 20s-40s, and an event aimed at dialogue and discussion between feminist activists of all generations, but especially those Black feminists in the 50+ age category. The project will deliver a podcast, a recorded talk and discussion event and educationally-framed creative responses to curated artefacts from the BBC's archives, which will be hosted and promoted via partner organisations' platforms and via the website and social media channels of the BBC.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX000958%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The way that buildings have been designed and constructed has changed rapidly in recent years, driven to a significant extent by the need to meet challenges of climate change and energy costs, but also to reduce costs and respond to changes in tenure and demographics such as ageing populations. There is concern that smaller buildings, with reduced natural infiltration, increased insulation and limited ventilation, in addition to increasing sources of chemicals and moisture in buildings could be having a significant detrimental impact on indoor air quality (IAQ). The question arising from this is what the health impacts of this might be. A successful application was made to the AHRC to establish the Health Effects of Modern Airtight Construction (HEMAC) network which brought together public health and building professionals with architects and their clients to identify shared research questions and develop ways of addressing these issues, with an overall aim of supporting the design of healthy, low energy homes. The HEMAC network bridged the gap between these fields, using a trans-disciplinary dialogue driven by architectural design to identify relationships, risks and opportunities between design of housing and public health in the 21st century. The network has gathered together a wider range of knowledge and expertise and has produced a number of research proposals, but it became clear during the workshops that there is a significant gap in knowledge and awareness of the issues of ventilation, IAQ and health within the design communities, landlords, and building occupants.  The aim of this follow-on project therefore is collate the knowledge generated by the network and translate this into information that can be used by a number of different audiences. These include end users of buildings via occupant guides, but also engagement with patient groups that are particularly affected by these issues. The project will produce design guidance and CPD information for use by architects and clients that identify good practice for designing for good IAQ in terms of ventilation and source control. It will also facilitate workshop sessions with policy makers to identify legislative and policy needs.","The HEMAC network, whilst identifying significant gaps in knowledge, nevertheless gathered contemporary evidence on the relationships between health and ventilation in modern homes. It is therefore important to communicate this knowledge to a variety of public stakeholders and agencies as a means to influence design of homes to improve ventilation and health. This a crucial time to undertake this dissemination, firstly given increasing concerns about air quality and secondly given the UK Government target to deliver 300,000 new homes and the Scottish Government target of 50,000 homes. Advice that may influence the design and use of these has the potential to make a significant impact on issues of IAQ and consequent public health for those occupants. As well as influencing new homes, the knowledge being generated by the network is of value to many millions of existing households as the issues are applicable to older homes, particularly those undergoing retrofit. The activity will therefore impact on four distinct groups: i) Building occupants and their representatives (e.g. landlords and Housing Associations) and building owners. We will reach this group through advice contained in occupant guides that aims to lead to increased awareness of IAQ issues and to influence behavioural change both in clients (such as improved requirements for ventilation and pollution control) and occupants (though improved utilisation of ventilation provision and pollutant reduction). ii) Specific dissemination will be directed at vulnerable groups. These are occupants and representative participants (e.g. clinicians) with medical conditions that may be particularly affected by IAQ, such a Asthma and COPD. We will undertake focus groups to explore key issues and design requirements for particular conditions that will lead to specific advice for these groups, and the gathering of information about the particular needs of these groups. iii) Construction companies and architects across the UK with national standing. We will disseminate improved design advice and professional development to building designers concerning aspects such as building material pollutant sources, and effective strategies for ventilation to improve health. A design guide and continuing professional development (CPD) courses will be developed. This has the potential to impact the design of all new homes and retrofit for existing households.  iv) Policy makers and client groups. The follow-on study will also aim to impact on building legislation and funding by connecting policy makers legislators to the research knowledge emerging from the network and subsequent research. It is timely as it will be able to feed into to current debates about regulation in the construction industry and the current drive for the production of new homes. The ultimate impact objective is to improve the health and well-being of occupants of contemporary homes, by targeting each of these distinct groupings we believe we can achieve this on a holistic manner. Information and media generated from this project will also be used to support other dissemination and KE activities such as invited talks and presentations. It will also be used in CPD and Masters course content.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS010467%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              It seems obvious that we say ""Mary's children are intelligent"", but not *""Mary's children is intelligent"". Many other languages are like English in this respect, and linguists have an (apparently) good explanation for it. In the possessive noun phrase ""Mary's children"", ""Mary"" is the possessor and ""children"" is the possessed item. The possessed item is the head of the phrase and the possessor is a (grammatical) dependent of the head. The properties of the head are more important for larger syntactic structures containing the phrase than the properties of the dependent. In our example, the possessed noun ""children"" determines, i.e. controls, the form of the verb (""are intelligent""). Linguists call this relation ""agreement"". Since the possessor ""Mary"" is a dependent of ""children"", it cannot control agreement. That is why *""Mary's children is intelligent"" is impossible. Speakers ""know"" this at some level, and we linguists have a technical explanation for these rules in terms of the properties of heads and dependents.  But not all languages behave like English in this respect, so the explanation that linguists have accepted cannot be a general one. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that in some languages, e.g. Maithili spoken in India or Chimane spoken in Bolivia, it is possible for the opposite to be true under certain conditions. Contrary to what is usually expected, when both possessor and possessed are part of the same syntactic phrase, the grammatical properties of the possessor (and not the possessed item) are relevant for syntactic processes such as agreement with the verb. In such cases, the possessor has a greater deal of 'prominence' than typically encountered. This type of data presents linguistic theorists with a challenge. Agreement with a prominent possessor is an issue for syntactic theory because, despite attested variability across languages in this respect, models of syntax have little to say about it. They have hitherto assumed that agreement is a relation that holds between a verb and the head of one of its subject noun phrase(s), but not a dependent element within that noun phrase.  Another relevant syntactic process is switch-reference: a special type of marking indicating that the subjects of the two clauses refer to the same entity. It typically targets the head of the possessive phrase, but in some languages, e.g. Turkish, switch-reference marking indicates that the possessor within the subject phrase of one clause is interpreted as referring to the same entity as the subject of the second clause. Data of this kind is typologically challenging because very little is known about how prominent possessors are manifested within the same phrase as the possessed item, and how they function in grammar. The extent of the phenomenon and in what languages and language families they are found has never been investigated. While currently understudied, the implications of these possessive constructions for our understanding of how grammar works are profound, and the time is ripe for a focused investigation. Our collaborative project will (i) investigate the phenomenon of prominent possessors from a theoretical and cross-linguistic perspective; (ii) collect new data from little studied related and unrelated languages; (iii) compile a database and make it fully available for public online use; and (iv) publish articles on the significance of our findings for current theories of grammar.","The core activities carried out for this research constitute empirically motivated theoretical work whose major impact will be within the field of linguistics, in particular in syntax and typology. While linguistic research of this kind makes a long-term contribution to a knowledge base that influences developments in social and commercial applications, we have identified two key communities beyond our narrow academic environment where impact will be more immediate, through the instigation of activities or development of resources that will increase the likelihood of engagement with the research outputs. Such resources are not currently available through any other outlet. The two impact-beneficiary groups can be identified as:  (i) The native speaker communities of two of the languages that will feature as part of our case study methodology, namely, Chimane and Tundra Nenets.  Both languages are highly endangered: there is a constant decline in the number of native speakers and the transmission of the language to children is limited. These negative factors notwithstanding, representatives of the native communities have expressed their wish to cooperate with linguists in documenting their languages as fully as possible and to have access to reliable online and printed resources supporting this goal. The resources we are planning to create include a pedagogical primer for Chimane and new glossing conventions for use in Tundra Nenets language teaching. They will benefit the speakers of Chimane and Tundra Nenets by providing source and reference materials for their languages. With this we are hoping to increase language awareness in the local communities, and encourage younger generations to explore their traditional linguistic heritage. Our impact pathways will also support the activities of individuals in the two communities who are engaged in language pedagogy, online journalism and linguistic activism, and potentially contribute to language maintenance.  (ii) Members of the public who have an active interest in languages and/or socio-cultural diversity in general, particularly in issues surrounding language endangerment. Our work will enhance the general knowledge and appreciation of endangered languages and cultures, bring largely unknown linguistic and cultural traditions to greater public attention, and provide better understanding of the factors that threaten and sustain languages. This will be achieved in part through public outreach activities to be held as part of the annual Endangered Languages Week held at SOAS, which will provide an opportunity to share socio-cultural and linguistic information about Chimane and Tundra Nenets to non-academic beneficiaries in an informal setting. This event is largely publicized and has been well attended by the members of non-academic public. The further enhancement of existing online resources for Tundra Nenets - which have already generated considerable interest among non-academic users - will likewise allow the results of our research to be made accessible to the general public. These activities have the potential to improve awareness of biocultural diversity in its human context, and assist its measurement, assessment and maintenance. This goal is important because biocultural diversity is currently under threat and its loss spells dramatic consequences for humanity and the earth.  The PI's ability to deliver on these goals successfully is supported by her receipt of the Women of Discovery Humanity Prize from Wing World Quest (2008), the foremost international organization dedicated to recognizing and supporting the women who are advancing scientific inquiry, education and environmental conservation, and two awards for creating teaching aids for the minority communities in Russia (from Yakut Ministry of Education in 2000, and the Association of the Minorities of the Russian North in 2004).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM010708%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              While traditional dialect atlas work has concentrated on phonological and lexical variation, recent years have seen a surge in work on dialect syntax, particularly in Europe. In the context of Scotland, there are a few studies on the morphosyntax of a small number of specific Scots dialects, but there has been no systematic coverage of the type proposed here, and indeed no such project has been conducted on any English dialect region to date. This is not only a substantial gap in the descriptive record, but also a gap in the analytical landscape: previous syntactic atlas projects have shown that the geographically sophisticated microcomparative method is a powerful tool for testing theoretical accounts of syntactic properties that vary across dialects, and since Scots dialects show substantial variation with respect a number of theoretically significant syntactic phenomena (e.g. subject-verb agreement, negation and relativization), it presents the analyst with a major opportunity to reassess many key issues in English syntax and indeed theoretical linguistics more widely. The primary goal of SCOSYA is to begin to fill this gap by providing a systematic and theoretically informed description of the non-standard syntactic properties of contemporary dialects of Scots and representing the results visually in an online atlas. We will gather data from four speakers in 122 locations distributed across Scotland and Northern Ireland; the main source of data will be grammaticality judgements, gathered using the interview method employed successfully in other projects, but this will be supplemented by recordings of conversational discourse between dialect speakers, which will be transcribed and made available through the website. The judgement data will be entered into a database which will form the basis for the online atlas; this will be fully interactive, allowing users to generate their own maps plotting the distribution of individual syntactic phenomena or combinations of phenomena, with various visualisation options. The atlas will have two interfaces, one for non-experts and one for experts; the former will be supplemented by commentary and instructions to ensure that it is user-friendly for the general public, while the latter will link to transcripts and full sound files for research purposes. In addition to the atlas data, we will also gather judgement data on locale-specific phenomena of interest that have remained understudied until now, thus extending the description of the grammar of Scots dialects substantially. We will then use this substantial descriptive resource to pursue a number of analytical and theoretical goals. The key analytical questions are: (i) to what extent do dialectally variable syntactic phenomena co-occur (in a manner not directly attributable to geographic/sociohistoric factors)? (ii) to what extent does the range of variation with syntactic phenomena realise full paradigms, and if not, are there significant gaps in the paradigms, and what would account for those gaps? (iii) what differences are there between the dialects of older and younger speakers, and do any differences between dialects co-occur with others across dialect regions? The answers to these analytical questions will give us new insight into the nature of the syntactic phenomena. The central theoretical goal of the project is to use the empirical picture provided by the atlas to reassess just which aspects of syntactic variation are to be accounted for by parameters, and which are the result of rules that negotiate how syntactic representations are realized morphophonologically (by fundamentally post-syntactic rules); that is, how much syntactic variation is post-syntactic, and what kind of theory of syntax does this require?","Outside of the academic community, the research will benefit the general public, educational policy makers, teachers and pupils. The general public: There are currently a number of excellent online resources on Scots for the non-expert user (e.g. http://www.scotslanguage.com) but none which provide a systematic overview of the type proposed here. The Grammatical Atlas of Scots offers the user a 'one-stop shop' for the description of the structure of Scots in an accessible way. This will allow dialect speakers to make discoveries about their own dialects as well as those of others. For instance, users will be able to click on their location and see what the distinctive dialect features of their region are, with links to sound files of the form in use, and they will also be able to select dialect features to see their geographic distribution, allowing dialect speakers to see how their own dialects compare with those spoken in other parts of the country. The online questionnaire provides the general public with an opportunity to contribute their own linguistic knowledge on use of dialect features. The project's general audience blog will provide a further space for engagement on language issue. This blog will report on a variety of issues relating to Scots dialects, including stories from the field, informants' own views on Scots dialects and the fieldworker's encounters with the local linguistic cultures. Comments on each of the posts will be enabled. The atlas and blog together will thus allow for dissemination of the linguistics of Scots in a systematic way, while at the same time allowing the non-expert to contribute to the wider debates through the interactive elements available in both. This interaction-based content should attract a high number of users in both Scotland and beyond. Schools: Scots plays an increasingly important role in Education Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence both at local and national level (e.g. http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/knowledgeoflanguage/scots/index.asp), as it does in Northern Ireland (e.g. http://www.ulsterscotsagency.com/fs/doc/flagship-schools-programme/USA_Flagship_Programme_(Final_Version).pdf). While cultural aspects are quite well covered in the curriculum, teaching of the linguistics of Scots is less so. This is in part due to the lack of easily accessible information on the actual use of Scots in the 21st century, so the Grammatical Atlas of Scots will contribute to this knowledge base. The proposed visit to ten schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland, in tandem with the prepared task-based materials based around the atlas, will encourage use of the resource. To further disseminate the resources described here, we will conduct a one-day workshop at the University of Glasgow as part of the Continuing Professional Development activities held there. This will be open to all primary and high school teachers in Scotland. This will provide a further platform for showcasing a much-needed resource on Scots.  Policy makers: Scots has been at the forefront of the debate on Independence in Scotland. Much of the debate surrounds how distinctive Scots is when compared to English in England (e.g. http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/20/the-return-of-scots). The same debate has been ongoing in Northern Ireland for some years. The Grammatical Atlas of Scots Dialects provides a baseline resource for an informed debate on what Scots exactly is - how is it similar or different both within Scotland and compared to other varieties of English English and indeed varieties worldwide.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM005550%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Translation may seem like a simple matter of transposition between languages, but the translation of poetry in particular reveals the fascinating complexity and richness that comes from the interface of different languages and cultures. Language itself is constantly changing, and experimental forms of poetry have embraced the complex relations between words, meanings and the spaces they inhabit. As twenty-first century poetry expands into the possibilities of different media through international readings, performances and festivals, it also expands possibilities for translation. Poetry has always circulated internationally. The network will challenge the widespread view of autonomously monolingual poetic traditions while discovering how exchange between languages works in artistic terms, and how it brings cultural particularities into view. This network will bring together practitioners and critics of poetry and translation with visual and sound artists to discover new ways of creating and interpreting language across art forms and cultures. It will analyse the impact of experimental traditions that continue to forge links between different languages, and will discover new ways of presenting poetry to multilingual audiences. Through its link with the Poetry Library in London's Southbank Centre, it will invite active involvement from readers and practitioners of poetry beyond academic contexts. Though located primarily in a UK and European context, with a special focus on Wales and France, the network will be attentive to non-European influences and the co-existence of diverse cultures and languages. At a time when technologies such as machine translation are enabling communication, the apparent untranslatability of poetry makes it a crucial site for the creative exploration and understanding of intercultural difference.  The network will discover how poetry travels internationally, by examining international links and legacies that connect poetry across languages. Examples include the influence of early twentieth-century Dada performances on contemporary sound poetry or the adoption of mathematical procedures inspired by the 1960s French Oulipo writers by UK and American poets. How might these cross-currents engage with the multiple linguistic communities of contemporary Europe? How these exchanges in experimental practice shaped by race, class and gender? How does collaboration contribute to intercultural dialogue? What political questions are raised by a cross-border ethics of translation? How do visual forms contribute to transition between languages? The network will consider collaborations between poets and visual artists that explore equivalences of word, form and image in intersemiotic translation, that is, translation that substitutes sign systems or art forms rather than one language for another. How do these, as well as emerging hybrid forms enabled by new technologies, expand possibilities for intercultural dialogue? In a visual environment where there is much competition for attention, what is distinctive about the role of poetry? The closing conference will examine the role of sound in translation. What does it mean to listen to poetry in another language? In performance work that combines different media, what is the relation between translation and the political, physical or ecological dimensions of listening? How might considerations of noise open up new ways of listening to other languages? How can translation reveal different ways in which the poem 'listens'? How helpful is a musical comparison or vocabulary in discussion of the sound of a poem in translation? Conversely, what is meant when we talk about music as a language? Can the relationship between poet and translator be compared with that of composer and performer? The closing conference will investigate these and other questions, developing new knowledge about how to present poetry to contemporary international audiences.","Impact Summary  Beneficiaries from the research include the following: 1. Users of the Poetry Library The main UK non-academic partner will be the Saison Poetry Library at the South Bank Centre. With its substantial holdings of modern and contemporary poetry in English, as well as its comprehensive collection of poetry in translation, the Library caters to the specialist researcher as well as to the casual poetry reader and is the ideal partner for this network. As an institution that regularly engages with the public in a wide-ranging programme of poetry-related events, it is also fitting that the network use the Poetry Library for the first of its programme of events. The network will benefit the Poetry Library by exploring innovative ways of engaging the public in translation and enhancing the international dimension of the reading experience. Through sharing the outcomes of the project, these benefits will become available to other libraries with similarly energetic programmes of outreach, for example the Scottish Poetry Library. 2. Practitioners in the creative arts The network will aim to develop and theorise new and emerging areas of practice that will enable poets, artists, musicians and translators to better understand each other's work and the complex ways in which interdisciplinary creation contributes to artistic and cultural life. It will develop new international connections, particularly between the UK and France. The relationship between the senses and language, which is core to the project's structure, is little understood. By considering visual and sound elements through the frame of translation, the network will resolve some of the misconceptions that sometimes make it difficult to work across art forms and provide a new language for collaboration. 3. International and bilingual audiences The main non-UK partner is the Kunsthalle in Mulhouse, which will benefit from the development of an event designed to explore interfaces between poetry and the visual. The combination of practice and theorization in the seminar and performance will contribute to deepened understanding of how cross-artform interactions may be used productively in a multilingual context. The project will contribute to a longstanding collaboration between the Université de Haute Alsace and the Kunsthalle by bringing an external, international perspective to bear on it. Similar insights will be gained from the conference in Bangor, where the new Bangor University Arts and Innovation Centre, Pontio, will benefit from the exploration of poetry and sound in the bilingual context of north Wales. The involvement of partners involved with different arts venues (the South Bank, the Kunsthalle and Pontio) will enable exchange of ideas and an enhanced understanding of how audiences may be build across different areas of interest. Organisations such as the Arts Councils of Wales and England will benefit from insights into cross-cultural collaboration that will facilitate the international dimensions of their work, and certain projects that they fund such as literature festivals. Better knowledge of how to present literature in translation and how to maximise audiences for performance events by combining art forms will be helpful in internationalizing the whole creative sector in the UK and raising aspirations for its future. Through contact with Literary Europe Live, the network will contribute to these ongoing aims. Overall, the public will benefit from the creation of new and innovative works of art that address specific cultural contexts. Perceived barriers to the enjoyment of poetry from different languages will be challenged. The participatory element of the network, building in particular on activities at the Poetry Library, will allow members of the public to shape and interact with the research as it develops.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP00539X%2F1

This project tackles the urgent need for research into the real extent of cultural diversity in the distant past, by tracing the culinary practices and impact of continental and North African migrants as they settled in a distant frontier province. The Roman period in Britain marked a high-point for the arrival of people, plants and animals from across Eurasia. Cities and military bases were cosmopolitan places in which the evidence for cultural diversity is matched by the evidence for new foods and vessels for cooking and eating. While modern audiences are familiar with the lives of Roman elites from ancient written sources and art, this project will focus on experiences of non-elites, provincials, immigrants and minorities through the integration of archaeological science and pottery research. By shifting attention to food and cuisine, this project offers a simple and effective way to plug gaps in understandings of Roman cultural diversity. It will develop a novel interdisciplinary approach based on the application of wellproven yet under-utilised techniques in the archaeological, scientific, and statistical analysis of Roman cooking wares. This suite of analyses will generate rich new data on the daily lives and foodways of multicultural societies in Roman Britain. It will involve combining the 'big data' analysis of Roman pottery use with state-of-the-art scientific techniques of organic residue analysis of lipids, including chromatography, mass spectrometry, stable carbon isotope analysis, and powerful new statistical approaches for data analysis. Through this approach, it will be possible for the first time to determine what kinds of foods were being cooked in different kinds of Roman pots, and associate this with the origins and experiences of their users. Three highly connected and multicultural environments will be examined, comprising: Colchester, Britain's first Roman veteran colony established shortly after the Roman conquest in AD 49; Vindolanda, a fort near Hadrian's Wall known for its writing tablets produced by a diverse garrison; and York, a city that hosted the African emperor Septimius Severus in AD 208-11, whose visit coincided with the production of new pottery with foreign elements unparalleled in elsewhere Britain. These case-studies will be supplemented by research into the occurrence of pottery types at other locations in Britannia and the Roman world, to properly appreciate their significance in the context of Rome's globalising empire. The project findings will build upon the scant evidence for multiculturalism in Britain's distant past, shed new light on the cultural impacts of migrants and their cuisine, and demonstrate the true extent of cultural diversity that existed in this insular and peripheral region.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW010550%2F1

The main outcome of the research is an immersive and interactive virtual reality installation where individuals can participate in a group singing event on a Lake District mountain summit in virtual reality, commemorating the 1923 gift of land to the nation in memory of those who lost their lives in the Great War 1914-18. The project draws together the various threads of the challenge in a unique way, uniting memory, place and performance in a compelling realisation of the power of immersive experiences to transform historical events through cultural participation. Current research identifies important health and wellbeing benefits associated with both fell-walking and group singing, and this project provides opportunities not just for able-bodied participants to enjoy the multiple wellbeing benefits of singing on mountain summits, but uniquely will provide opportunities for those otherwise unable to access such activities to do so through an immersive virtual reality experience. This project also seeks to develop relationships with cultural heritage partners in the Lake District and beyond, and to develop a workflow for the capture and virtual reality reproduction of choir performances in inaccessible but culturally significant locations, to permit the application of the technology in a wide range of installations and exhibitions in the future.","The immediate beneficiaries of this project include the project choir established to rehearse and record the musical materials during the capture for VR, those members of the general public who participate in the VR installations, the National Trust, Keswick Museum, the ensemble Mouthful, and the local communities of the Lake District and wider public in general. In the future, the results of this study will also benefit other custodians of potentially inaccessible but culturally significant locations, such as the North York Moors National Park Authority and National Parks Wales. Participants in the study will benefit in a number of ways. Having the opportunity to work with Mouthful, an inspirational UK a capella ensemble, and to perform in a group on a Lake District summit in a technically innovative way will make for a very exciting and memorable experience. Participants of the VR experience will also directly benefit from the uplifting and unique experience of listening to a choir sing on top of a Lake District summit, or even becoming involved in the performance themselves as co-performers. Especially for those members of the public with challenges of mobility, the project will provide an unprecedented opportunity to participate virtually in an exciting and meaningful cultural event. There will also be an indirect general benefit for local communities and the wider public in general, through the commemoration of the 1923 gift of land by the FRCC, and its role in transforming the way that the British public's relationship to the land changed after the Great War 1914-18, facilitating wider dialogue about and awareness of the value both of outdoor activities and group singing. Third Sector partners will also directly benefit from this project. Completion of the project will allow The National Trust to meet their strategic aims, including 'Experiences that Move, Teach and Inspire', 'Growing Support' and 'Restoring a Healthy, Beautiful Natural Environment'. The project is expected to: demonstrate an increased engagement with the location in participants; secure significant Advertising Value Equivalent (AVE) in local media, with the potential for national media interest; help explore the potential for engaging new audiences by working with organisations involved with mental wellbeing in Cumbria; and help start a conversation with wider visitors to the Lake District about the nature of these mountains as war memorials, and to help change behaviours that cause damage and show disrespect to the natural environment. Keswick Museum will also benefit from such an innovative exhibit which will reach and engage new audiences in the curatorial work they do and draw members of the public into the museums' other galleries, helping not only to access the museums' wider collections and role in the community, but helping members of the public to view the museum as an innovative and exciting place of discovery and technological advancement. Finally, as professional artists on the project, Mouthful will benefit from the opportunity to present their artistic work in a completely new format for public engagement, and from the increased profile of their artistic work.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR009139%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Guildhall School of Music & Drama is a world-leading small specialist higher education institution with established research strengths in Music and Drama. But it also has decades-long established training expertise in Production Arts (sometimes called Technical Theatre), providing the highly skilled creative workforce without which high-quality theatrical (and to a certain extent musical) performance cannot be realised. Our research environment has grown rapidly since the School's first participation in the national assessment of HE research in 2008; Production Arts is the one main area where lack of technological capability has so far held us back. In the increasingly important areas of digital performance and technologically enhanced immersive experience in particular, we lack the necessary infrastructure. Therefore we are applying for funding to establish a new Production Arts research facility in-house. This development will build on our existing extensive range of partnerships with small and medium-sized companies working in the UK creative industries, as well as with selected HE research partners. It will involve using existing spaces within our buildings to deploy largely portable state-of-the-art equipment in order to explore the research potential of visual effects and extended reality (XR, incorporating, variously, hyper-, augmented and virtual reality). We will use this equipment to carry out a series of creative research projects that explore technology's role in the future of production artistry. In the first place, this will be achieved by providing access for performance makers and researchers inside the School to world-class technical facilities, but-just as important-it will also facilitate their access to the skills and knowledge of existing and additional industry partners, drawn in by the opportunity to benefit from our investment. Our medium-term aim is to crystallise this dynamic by establishing a Performance Industry Centre for the Research and Application of Creative Technologies. Not only would this research centre consolidate and grow our research collaborations and exchanges with industry and other HEIs, it would help effect internal collaboration between the Research department, Guildhall Live Events (a semi-spun-out teaching, research and commercial services body), and the new Electronic and Produced Music department (which has recently recruited new staff working at the edges of this area, especially in gaming).  The first step, and the object of the present request, is the procurement of two significant pieces of audio-visual hardware and associated IT for their use. (A third piece of equipment, complementary but more focused on our workforce training mission, is the object of another funding bid.) The period of the grant will be devoted to their installation by technical staff from the Production Arts department, the training of a small core of researchers, and the planning and initial implementation of a series of creative technology workshops aimed at selecting a range of pilot projects to test the potential of a) the equipment, b) its interaction with the School's existing research teams, both entirely internal and involving familiar external partners, and c) new partners from among the most innovative small businesses in the sector. The plan is then to review progress and move ahead with development of the new research centre in whatever is revealed to be the most productive and sustainable way.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX010309%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Europe has rich and diverse cultural heritage resources, which include landscapes and landscape elements, comprising standing monuments, buried archaeological sites, and artefacts. This cultural heritage is endangered by environmental processes and anthropogenic pressures, and specifically by intensive agriculture activities and climate change. These pose a range of immediate and future threats to these sensitive cultural landscapes and the historical, archaeological and environmental archives they preserve. Recent research carried out both in Britain and Italy, has highlighted that at least 70% of archaeological sites in rural areas are subject to direct and physical damages caused by agricultural activity. In addition to direct damages (due to ploughing, drainage, irrigation, etc.), agriculture has also been shown to increase the extent of soil erosion and to affect the soil properties, reducing the ability of the soil to preserve the buried heritage and affecting the structural stability and amplifying the natural deterioration of the exposed structures. Meanwhile, climate change is one of the most important and urgent problems facing us today, with implications for natural and societal systems (agriculture, human health, forestry, and infrastructure) including cultural heritage. The consequences of these pressures are proving to be catastrophic for the European Cultural Landscape as testified by recent collapses in Pompeii and the Aurelian Walls in Rome. The authorities responsible for the preservation of the cultural landscape are well aware of the huge costs required by rehabilitation intervention as compared with preventive ones, hence they require systematic, effective, usable and affordable tools to monitor the degradation process and enabling preventive maintenance. n light of the critical issues described above, monitoring soil processes and soil use changes that can be produced by climate changes (environmental pressures) and agricultural activities (anthropogenic pressures) can therefore help to prevent damages to our buried and exposed archaeological heritage. The CLIMA project aims to promote highly interdisciplinary research, based on one hand on a soil-oriented approach to monitoring and modelling soil based processes that may affect cultural preservation, whilst designing and developing a multi-task WebGIS platform, to combine advanced satellite and ground based remote sensing technologies for mapping and monitoring of cultural landscapes with archaeological remains. The CLIMA platform will be able to create high resolution maps and to document archaeological features (anomalies, soilmarks, cropmarks, etc.) linked to buried remains, by the using and the innovative processing of optical high resolution satellite images. In addition it will be able to generate periodic warning maps aimed at monitoring human and natural changes in the cultural landscapes and in particular, land use change and vegetation change (increase or reduction). CLIMA will also allow the acquisition of time sequences of data concerned with identifying minimal shifts in standing architectural structures, and movements of ground surface related to landslides and subsidence phenomena, as well as alterations of the ground surface related to erosion processes, in order to produce periodic vulnerability maps. Furthermore, an innovative ground-based tool for mapping and monitoring lateral soil erosion and vertical disturbance of soils affected by agricultural activities will be developed utilizing in-situ gamma spectrometry technology to enable real-time, non-destructive drive-over survey of soil erosion across archaeological sites. This will be particularly powerful for monitoring and managing risk from agriculture and land use change in rural cultural landscapes.","The project (CLIMA) impact will be delivered by the technologies, procedures and systems developed for the long term monitoring of cultural heritage in rural areas allowing the monitoring and identification of changes in the landscape due to climate changes and anthropic pressure and by finally providing risk maps of the sites surveyed as resources for decision making authorities. The full impact of the CLIMA platform will be ensured by dissemination activities aimed at the stakeholders and end-users involved in cultural heritage management to make them aware of the available technology and science as well as the benefits CLIMA offers. The dissemination and promotion of the results of the project to facilitate uptake by a variety of end users communities, including commercial subjects, will be developed through several initiatives: i) presentation of CLIMA activities, intermediate and final project results at three main conferences and workshops; ii) producing short articles in newspapers and sector magazines; iii) developing promotional material: leaflets, press releases, newsletters and a final publication in pdf format; iv) creating electronic documents on selected results, papers and publications to be disseminated also during workshops, conferences and fairs during which CLIMA results (preliminary and final) will be presented. A web site with a content management system will be used for data exchange and result evaluation between partners and institutions involved, integrating the primary source of information about the project to be diffused according to the user's privileges. The relevant regulatory authorities in the UK, Italy and Cyprus act as project partners in CLIMA further ensuring dissemination, uptake of the technology and impact in the form of improved monitoring and management of European cultural landscapes.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN504452%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This collaborative project - involving a composer, architect, community-building project manager / development scholar, film maker, electronics engineer and graphic designer - aims to draw public attention to the levels of noise pollution in Indian cities, with a particular focus on Delhi, which is now considered one of the top 10 mega-cities in the world. Building on work undertaken as part of the UnBox Labs in Ahmedabad, India, in February/March 2014, it aims to raise people's awareness of the problem of noise pollution. Whilst peace and quiet are essential to rest and recuperation, city traffic and other noise pollution can deleteriously affect human health by raising blood pressure and heart rate, disturbing sleep, and causing hearing loss or in extreme cases deafness.  We propose the building of an experimental device, the mobile Noise Abatement Pod (mNAP). This device, a soundproof box on the back of a pedal-powered bicycle rickshaw, will be used as a 'social condenser': an object that will attract attention in its own right; will invite participants to comment on their experience of it and their desires for the sonic landscape of the future of their city; and will act as a container for people to immerse themselves into the soundscape of contemporary life in both rural and urban contexts (and thus from quiet to loud) in order to raise awareness of the disruptive effects of high levels of noise.  Through online and other documentation, through presentation at the UnBox Festival in Delhi, and by offering the sound installation and mNAP designs online, we hope to leave a legacy that will inform and energise other organisations and groups to campaign for a quieter, more healthy environment in other cities around India and the world.","We are planning to raise awareness of the damaging effects of noise pollution. In order to make the project as impactful as possible, we will use the box with a particular set of user groups. Rather than targeting random passers-by, we will be targeting key spaces and key groups within the city of Delhi. We have identified these key groups as city planners, policy makers, officials from the auto-rickshaw companies, labour union members who are exposed to these damaging levels of noise day-in, day-out, as well as journalists. Participants from these key-groups are likely to have an exponential multiplying effect when it comes to spreading knowledge of the project, the damage caused by noise, and potential actions that can be taken. Our local contacts will help establish further contacts within these groups and individuals, as well as other key contacts during the run-up of the project. The potential knock-on effects of something that could, on first sight, be considered a small-scale one-off aural-spatial experiment are therefore substantial.  Economic: By raising people's attention to the deleterious effects of noise pollution, our goal is the creation of a more peaceful and healthy environment in which to live and work. The economic benefits of this to society at large - through increased productivity in a more concentration-friendly environment - are not to be underestimated. By inviting city-planners to experience these levels of noise in our installation, we anticipate that their experience of the noise can be used to catalyse different, more people-friendly designs.  Social: The social benefits of a quieter and more acoustically attractive and inclusive environment are enormous. Not only will the negative health impacts of noise pollution be ameliorated but a quieter environment will support more concentrated work and social interaction (Schafer 1993).  Cultural and/or policy impacts: Our project supports extant noise abatement policy found in several countries around the world. Noise levels in many parts of India and the rest of the world already surpass safe and desired limits for urban living. The project will raise awareness of this problem through targeting representatives of those groups who are most exposed to it (e.g. auto-rickshaw drivers); work towards integrating policy and actual practice; and serve to point to new areas of policy development and/or a more widespread uptake and sympathy for noise abatement policy in general. The cultural impact is at least twofold: 1) as we are making an artistic/cultural artefact, we are inviting participants to experience a tactile, physical intertwining of musical and architectural design; 2) as so many cultural activities rely on concentration and acoustically neutral space, improving upon existing noise pollution levels will actively and very concretely improve the working and exhibition/performance lives of many artists and practitioners of various disciplines. In this context, our fieldwork needs to be considered as part of our dissemination strategy and forms a crucial part of the impact of this project. Whilst it is outside the remits of the project to follow up how the experience of the noise composition might lead to certain actions, we anticipate that participation in the experiment will have a lasting effect on individuals and their professional conduct. We also anticipate that key participants will lend their support at the project's official launch during the Unbox Festival in November 2014. Videos of the project in both contexts will be globally available via youtube. These will be available collectively on a website dedicated to the project. This will promote the existing installation, the values and goals of noise pollution abatement in general, as well as forming promotional material for the potential further installation of the project in different contexts around the world.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM005658%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project investigates the potential impact of learning a second language (L2) on a speaker's native language (L1). Native language attrition describes a change in speakers' L1 skills or knowledge when they are no longer exposed to it as frequently, for instance after migrating. This may manifest in word retrieval difficulties, comprehension delays, lack of confidence, etc. The least understood aspect of attrition concerns the vulnerability of a speaker's L1 grammar: their subconscious knowledge of the language's structure which is set during childhood. While relatively rare and restricted, attrition in adult L1 grammar is attested. Yet strikingly, it is incompatible with current models of language acquisition which assume that speakers' grammars remain unaltered beyond childhood. Our view is that such acquisition models, assuming stable L1 input in adulthood, have overlooked a potentially significant influence of substantive changes in L1 input. To elucidate the nature of grammatical attrition, we wish to investigate and provide answers to these questions:  1. Which aspects of the grammar are susceptible to attrition? 2. What language input conditions favour attrition? 3. How can a model of L1 acquisition be articulated to accommodate attrition? 4. What are the implications for the concept of the 'native speaker' for both academics and the general public?  Two of the investigators have recently begun to work towards an acquisition model entailing a prediction that attrition is more likely where the L2 is typologically close to the L1. The present project explores this experimentally, comparing the potential for grammatical attrition across three groups of speakers extensively exposed to another language variety during adulthood. The first group comprises speakers exposed to a syntactically distinct dialect of their L1 (Southern English speakers who have moved to Belfast); the second comprises speakers exposed to a typologically and diachronically related language (German speakers who have moved to the Netherlands); the third comprises speakers exposed to a typologically distinct language (Spanish speakers who have moved to Britain). Seeking robust evidence for the nature of the grammatical properties susceptible or resilient to attrition, we will undertake detailed comparative theoretical analyses of the syntactic phenomena in question. The composition of the project team bears out this integration of experimental L2 acquisition methods with theoretical approaches to comparative syntax. The three experimental groups will undertake a set of tasks to reveal their knowledge, use, and perceptions of their L1 by comparison with monolingual controls, including oral interviews (which will form a major new corpus of transcribed and tagged attrition data), off-line acceptability judgement tasks, an online processing task and a linguistic background and language use questionnaire. Our analysis will compare attrition patterns within and across the groups, identifying correlations with contextual characteristics, self-evaluation, quantity and quality of exposure to L1/L2 input. Combining these data with a nativeness perception task of attriters by monolingual L1 speakers allows us to problematise the concept of the 'native speaker', examining nuances and new understandings raised by L1 attrition both for the wider public and for its status within linguistic theory. This project will create the first open-access repository of attrited native speech will allow bilingual speakers to share experiences of attrition and website visitors to engage in debate. In summary, this project furthers our understanding of grammatical attrition in adult bilingual speakers on various levels. It establishes the nature and scope of attrition, advances new visions for major theories of the language faculty and its maturation within individuals, and explores implications for public and academic understandings of the 'native speaker'.","This project investigates changes in the grammars of adult bilingual/bidialectal native speakers. We are ultimately interested in examining how resilient adult native grammars are when speakers move from a 'monolingual only' input scenario to one where input from at least two languages or dialects are available. We employ a novel multi-method approach to investigate the nature and scope of attrition combining research tools from corpus linguistics, language acquisition and linguistic theory. By examining data from bidialectal/bilingual speakers collected through various tasks, we will provide significant evidence that can make a substantial contribution to important theoretical discussions currently taking place in the attrition research community. Two key questions driving our research agenda are: How can changes in input conditions affect the L1 grammar of bilingual/bidialectal speakers? How can current models of native language acquisition account for cases of grammatical attrition affecting adult grammars across different bilingual contexts? This project will create the first open-access oral corpus of attrited native language which will benefit the research community as a whole. Following established protocols set in the principal investigator's past projects, the new database will include the original audio files, transcriptions and corresponding XML files. We will make this resource fully available to the wider research community via the UK Data Service, Talkbank as well as via the University of Southampton website. This will benefit other researchers interested in native language attrition and will ensure that the impact of this research outlasts the life of the project. Besides the benefits to the academic community, this project will also benefit the very people undergoing attrition. Through our existing research, we have become aware that our participants, bilingual/bidialectal migrants, recognise that their knowledge and/or use of their native language has changed but they cannot understand how or why; furthermore, in some cases, these speakers report that they can no longer function as a 'proper native speaker'. We will create materials informing on what attrition is which these speakers will be able to access easily. We will also organise several information sessions targeting bilingual immigrant families to raise awareness on the flexibility of nativeness as a natural and expected outcome of migration. This project, thus, explores questions which are of interest to the general public. In particular, we are interested in raising awareness and start a public debate on the notion of nativeness and what different shapes it can take. We are used to think of a native speaker as someone who has perfect command and use of their native language (compared with foreign language learners for instance). Yet, as this project will show, this is not necessarily the case of millions of native speakers who migrate and settle in foreign language contexts. There is currently very little awareness of native language attrition by the public and of some of the difficulties that native speakers face when living abroad. A repository or oral speech aimed to the general public will provide samples of attrited native language. We will select excerpts from our oral interviews with some participants where they share and describe their experiences using their native language whilst living abroad. Visitors to this site will be able to become familiar with this variety of their own native language. They will also be able to learn about the feelings of speakers who have moved abroad and have little contact with other speakers of the same native language. Our findings will also have implications for those who work with migrant families, education specialists working with learners from diverse backgrounds and for those involved in promoting and supporting multilingualism in schools and communities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT005157%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will investigate the value to individual and community of the BIG Lottery-funded Volunteer Reader Scheme, which has been developed by award-winning charitable social enterprise, The Reader Organisation (TRO), as part of its pioneering outreach project, Get into Reading (GIR).  TRO's mission is to create environments where personal responses to books are freely shared in reading communities in every area of life. The GIR model is based on small groups (2-12 people), reading aloud together short stories, novels and poetry. GIR is distinguished from conventional reading groups by its shared-reading method: the literature exists live and performatively in the room; regular breaks in the reading encourage participants to reflect on what is being read, and weigh its language and meaning, often in implicit or explicit relation to their own life-experience, while readers always control their own involvement, contributing as much or as little as they choose. GIR currently delivers over 360 groups, in health and social care settings (community centres, libraries, homeless shelters, schools, hospitals, offices, doctors' surgeries, prisons, drug rehab units and care homes) across the UK. The related Volunteer Reader Scheme engages 70 people at risk of, or suffering from, mental health difficulties, isolation or unemployment in a range of volunteering opportunities at all levels of TRO. Volunteer roles operate at the heart of organisation's reading mission and whilst often still being members of reading groups, volunteers are further involved as: Office Assistants, preparing reading resources for reading groups; Reading Group Assistants, working alongside reading group facilitators: Reading Friends, reading weekly, one-to-one, with isolated older people; Reading Group Facilitators, running weekly reading groups in Residential Care Homes or with the elderly. Volunteers are fully trained and supported by TRO staff, receiving regular feedback and recognition of their achievements and are offered potential for role development: reading-group members may become volunteers; volunteers may become interns or apprentices; apprentices may become employees.  This study will build on the existing collaboration between The Centre for Research into Reading, Information and Linguistic Systems (CRILS) at the University of Liverpool, and its third sector partner, TRO, to develop innovative, interdisciplinary literary and social scientific methodologies for capturing multi-dimensional components of the reading experience. In two separate yet related and concurrent studies, the research will seek (1) to identify the unique value of shared reading as it is actually experienced by the volunteers, as a representative section of vulnerable and needy individuals, as well as examining the relationship of this intrinsic value to collateral benefits. Through comparison of a GIR group with a built environment discussion group, via analysis of transcribed audio-recordings, this study will test the hypothesis that serious literature has power to create both individual meaningfulness and a strongly interactive small community; (2) to test the efficacy of the movement from, and inter-relation between, reading group-membership and future facilitation of reading groups, by comparing the experience of volunteers as continuing group-members and as developing group-helpers, gaining increased master. Dynamic and diverse volunteer case studies will be compiled, via interviews, observations, questionnaires, and these will be cross-referenced with routine audit data, to establish the connection between intrinsic literary affect and individual mental health and community well-being. This study will also consider how TRO's recent acquisition of an International Reading and Wellbeing centre, Calderstones Park Mansion House, may serve as a future Merseyside hub to create a larger community of volunteers engaged in reader and other-related activities.","1.The immediate primary beneficiaries of this project will be the participants in the Volunteer Reader Scheme. Those directly involved in the research process - through co-construction of questionnaires and collaborative compilation of individual case studies - will thereby be encouraged to engage in deepened and enriched reflection on their volunteer experience as well as develop and contribute in new ways and at new levels of self and community. The production of high quality research also has potential to benefit reader volunteers in the longer term, by providing evaluative evidence for future funding of the volunteer scheme. 2.The project will benefit The Reader Organisation by: a.Assessing the vital and intrinsic value components of TRO's core cultural activity - shared reading, specifically TRO's pioneering 'Get into Reading' model. b.Identifying the relationship between the intrinsic value of shared reading and the known and unknown outcomes of TRO in terms of health and well-being, at both individual and community levels. c.Delivering robust evaluation of a volunteer model which TRO seeks to embed across the organisation's activity, structurally and regionally, thereby influencing TRO's future volunteer strategy.  d.Contributing to the evidence base for securing future commissions of both Get into Reading and the Volunteer Reader Scheme, particularly through the emphasis on recovery and resilience. 3.The benefits to TRO can potentially be extended to TRO's associates in the volunteer venture and beyond: a.Mersey Care NHS Mental Health Trust is one of TRO's partners in the initiative to transform the Calderstones Park Mansion House into an International Centre for Reading and Wellbeing (preferred leaseholder status for which purpose has recently been granted to TRO by Liverpool City Council). Mersey Care regards the Calderstones Project as an opportunity to redevelop volunteering at all levels of its own service. As one of only three trusts of its kind in the country providing the entire range of specialist mental health services, Mersey Care's volunteering model is likely to influence mental services elsewhere in the UK. b.Wirral Metropolitan Council have implemented TRO's volunteering programme at Leasowe Library as a pilot project for developing a new model library which, if successful, will be replicated across the borough with the active support of Wirral MBC. This model has potential to shape future national policy re Volunteering and Libraries.  3.The contribution to public services of voluntary organisations and those that support volunteering has never been higher on the national agenda, or more keenly scrutinised and celebrated. Following the recent passing of the Social Value Act (Jan 2013), which legally requires commissioners to take into account social value when taking decisions about how to deliver public services, Sir Stuart Etherington, Chief Executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, described third sector enterprises which involve volunteers as 'frequently the most expert organisations in their fields, with the skills and the drive to create genuinely better services'. As a BIG-Lottery-funded volunteer scheme, TRO's example has the potential to become a flagship model for volunteering schemes in a range of cultural and health sectors. Robust research in respect of TRO's model will allow examples of best practice to influence existing arts in health and arts in the community initiatives as well laying the foundations for the development of future schemes. This research will also potentially encourage public-funded cultural institutions - art galleries, museums, orchestras - to look beyond conventional social groupings for volunteer recruitment, to include, for example, at-risk teenagers and care-leavers.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL004674%2F1

There is a growing recognition that addressing the mounting ecological problems facing environmental, social and mental life requires challenging the place occupied by the individual living human subject as the paradigmatic form of political and artistic agency. Addressing these global challenges requires inventing new ways of listening to alternative voices.  This early career researcher-led project will build an international network of expertise in order to add value to the multiple and varied Connected Communities projects that challenge anthropocentric assumptions about the stakeholders of participatory research. The project will synthesize results from at least 15 related projects that address this theme, building a multimedia cartography of diverse projects that share the problem of how to involve agents who do not possess an ordinary 'voice' in participatory democratic processes and research co-production, and how to establish legitimate forms of authority to translate and speak 'for' these actors.  The project will facilitate international collaboration to build new methods, approaches, case studies, frameworks and literatures around participation's ""others"". Activities include workshops in the UK and USA, residential 'slow thinking' retreats, and a symposium. At least six community partners and independent artists, in the UK and USA, will take an active part in the design of the project activities and outputs. The outputs will include an interactive online map, a collection of essays, and a public art project, as well as conventional academic outputs, all aimed at extending the legacy of Connected Communities research. The interactive maps will chart current and previous research projects that invent methods for engaging participation's ""others"", with search functions specifically developed in line with the plurality of modes of participatory inquiry identified in the workshops. This online resource will help orient, provoke and inspire current and future trans-disciplinary teams in formulating new research projects in a post-human context. A collection of short, accessible reflections on the project will be edited along the model of the well-received ""Problems of Participation: Democracy, Authority, and the Struggle for Common Life"", which was published by this research team as part of an earlier Connected Communities project. The public art project will be led by the artists at the retreat and will stimulate broader engagement with the inventive methods drawn together.","This project takes place in a context of climate change, resource depletion, and growing global mental health problems. Part of the reason for the continued failure to address these problems is that key stakeholders (including non-humans and future generations) are not sufficiently taken into account. At the heart of this project is the conviction that, while dominant research paradigms have given rise to remarkable improvements in a range of areas, they have failed to address how changing communities can remain within sustainable and healthy limits. The impacts of transforming research practices in order to listen better to participation's 'others', then, are potentially very large. The project also has a number of more specific beneficiaries.  (1) Key beneficiaries include the 6 community organisations and arts practitioners directly involved in the project. These collaborators are particularly interested in developing new methodologies for including excluded stakeholders, and in 'up-skilling' in methods of post-human participatory research and artistic practice. Such up-skilling provides the necessary ground for genuine and sustainable interdisciplinary co-production. They will also benefit from expanded international networks. (2) The novel application of the coproduction paradigm promises to be useful for a much wider body of community groups, think tanks and policy-makers who work at the interface of human, non-human or inter-generational communities. The project incorporates activities specifically designed to provide stakeholders with: (a) practical resources, (b) theoretical tools, and (3) artistic devices that will enable many different stakeholders to engage with the project at an appropriate level.  (2a) Community groups, policy makers, and thinktanks will benefit from the creation of a searchable online map of techniques for including participation's 'others', which will equip users with practical tools for generating new ideas, correlations, cross-fertilisations, shared hypotheses and research agendas. The mapping resources will be available online, presenting examples of methods and approaches for conducting participatory research and signposting users to existing projects depending on how the maps are searched.  (2b) People and organisations occupying 'hinge' positions between communities and academic researchers will also benefit from an accessible, jargon-free book of short essays on participating with non-humans and more-than-humans. Contributions aim at stimulating discussion of participatory methods and participation's 'others', building on the success of the 'Problems of Participation' book that emerged from our previous Connected Communities project ""Community Authority, Knowledge and Performance in Participatory Practice"". These essays will benefit community organisations and other stakeholders by introducing, in an accessible fashion, a vocabulary for articulating the importance of developing new practices of creative listening. 300 copies of the book will be printed and distributed to community groups and think tanks. It will also be published as a free e-book, and we will post the essays on our landing page on the OpenDemocracy website, which has over 215,000 unique visitors a month.  (2c) The project will also engage a much broader general audience through a public art project. This public art project will take the form of a 'technology of transformation', provoking new framings of who and what 'counts' in participation. The artists-in-residence at the retreat will lead this, and both its form and aims will be co-determined as the retreat progresses. Where the mapping tools provide the practical resources, and the collection of essays will develop the conceptual arguments, this public art project will provide the aesthetic tools for sensitizing a broad audience to the activity and relevance of the non-human and more-than-human in research practices.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013282%2F1

Though the refugee experience is complex and varied, circumstances of under-employment, poor living conditions, limited social opportunities and mental health pressures are commonly reported. We hypothesize that parks and squares can be conceived as a resource for people at a time of foothold and new belongings; that a pleasant place to sit outside can support fluid social networks, improve local awareness, allow for an inclusive egalitarian positioning (the right to sit), and provide mentally restorative interludes. We are provisionally naming this ethos '#refugeeswelcome in parks'. However, there are challenges. The public realm can be a place where refugees feel uncertain about local norms, feel unwelcome, uncomfortable or are vulnerable to hate crime. Longstanding residents of a local area may react negatively to changing patterns of use of public spaces, especially when 'hanging out' is perceived as idle loitering, threatening, or fundamentally changing the ethos of a loved place. An increase in hostile architecture and management practice (implicitly acting against street sleeping) also impacts on destitute refugees. This project is focused on exploring relevance of previous research findings for 'real world practice'. We propose a two country, cross-sector investigation and knowledge exchange, with some broader baseline information gathering good practice case studies across northern Europe. The German experience in particular is relevant due to high numbers of new refugees, and the combination of grass-root initiatives and strategic, integrated infrastructure to address wellbeing and integration. Local scoping work with stakeholder organisations and refugees will take place in Berlin and will be contrasted with experiences in Sheffield and London.  Aims and objectives. With the ultimate ambition of improving refugee mental health and inclusion, our objectives are as follows:  Phase 1: developing informed partnerships To engage with stakeholders at both national and local contexts in two primary sectors - refugee integration and wellbeing, and public space management - seeking to understand the current state of policy and practice relating to refugees and use of urban public open space.  To understand key motivations and benefits of spending time outside for refugees: including the development of common typologies of preferred locations and common barriers faced in accessing and enjoying these. Phase 2: implementing agendas for change. Draw on these findings and best practice case studies, and work with stakeholders and community members to identify how '#refugeeswelcome in parks' may be supported or addressed within organisational priorities and initiatives, and (where appropriate) within their own localities. Support effective communication of this within or beyond individual organisations to effect long-term change. The project will focus on embedding awareness of the potential of spending time in urban public open space to improve refugee wellbeing and inclusion, with specific attention to addressing existing barriers and improving the integration of initiatives between refugee welfare and public space management. At the local level, this will trial inter-sector working to plan and start implementation of short-medium term initiatives, in Berlin this specifically relates to new residential developments. At the UK national level we will work with relevant organisations to align existing selected strategies or projects with the '#refugeesin parks' ethos.","The outcomes from this project will primarily benefit three different stakeholder groups.  + Stakeholder group 1. Organisations with a remit to support refugees.  Local Authorities, third sector refugee integration and wellbeing support, mental health support organisations, local level activists organisations. + Stakeholder group 2. Organisations with a remit to maintain and improve urban public open space.  Local Authorities, professionals and representative bodies of urban planning and landscape architecture, third sector environmental campaign organisations, parks and open space managers, community safety officers, local level supporters of urban greenspaces (Friends groups etc).  + Refugees living in a northern European urban context. We want these three groups of people and organisations to benefit long-term in the following ways: + Organisations supporting refugees to be aware of the benefits of spending time outside and to promote effective means of supporting this.  + Parks and other urban open spaces are managed to include the objective of inclusion of refugee users.  + Refugee wellbeing and inclusion to improve. Note: We use the word 'stakeholders' as it is common terminology within our sectors, but within the Connected Community framing these may be seen as 'community members': organisations (and individuals within these organisations) who gain positive outcomes, and potential legacy, from the project (CLK, p15). As detailed in the Case for Support, we will engage with these people/organisations in part as participants, and in part as short-term partnerships within the life of the project: informing the scoping phrase, engaging with the implementation stage, and where possible collaborating with us to develop initiatives for long-term impact in their own contexts. Within the timescale of the grant period (10 months) we expect to achieve benefits for the following organisations and contexts: 6 UK national stakeholder organisations (from groups 1 and 2), local scale organisations and refugees in Sheffield and London, local and federal scale organisations and refugees in Berlin, European level organisations supporting wellbeing and inclusion of refugees living in cities. Relevant to their areas of expertise and responsibilities these groups will gain: 1. A greater understanding of the importance of access to good quality public open space for refugee wellbeing and integration, and of common barriers to using this resource. 2. Access to ideas and strategies that draw on cross-sector expertise and good practice case studies from northern European countries. 3. An opportunity to align these with their own organisational aims to maximise the potential for improving refugee wellbeing. 4. An opportunity to align with their own strategies for supporting inclusive use of urban public space. 5. Development or adaptation of a local resource or project which will help reduce barriers or support motivations regarding refugee use of public open spaces.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP009514%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              'Improved Laser Printing Equipment for Ceramics' builds on the results of the AHRC funded project: 'Extending the Potential for the Digitally Printed Ceramic Surface' (AH/M004333/1). The new project will offer immediate incremental improvements to the ceramic laser printing equipment currently available to ceramic tableware and giftware manufacturers and ceramic design studios. The project will also act as a longer term stimulus by identifying the technical specifications for the next generation of machines that will be directly dedicated to the needs of UK ceramics companies and related creative industries. The value of laser printed ceramic technology has been proven in limited contexts: it is now widely employed to print small runs of ceramic transfers used to decorate tableware, giftware and artworks. More recently leading UK ceramic companies have started to recognise the technology's true potential and its commercial disruptive capability. This new appreciation is due in part to the AHRC funded research project conducted by the Royal College of Art. This has demonstrated that the new technology offers a range of aesthetic and economic opportunities unattainable with screenprinting, currently the dominant means of creating the large runs of ceramic transfers used to decorate high-value ceramics i.e. porcelain and bone china. As a truly digital technology, laser printing also holds the potential for complete integration of digital design development and the actual print processes.  One unanticipated outcome of the project was that the project team identified two key technical barriers to wider take-up of current laser ceramic printing technology. Whilst the laser print machines currently available were adequate for the requirements of office printing, two aspects of these laser printers' construction have proved to be weak links in the context of high volume, multi-colour accurate ceramic transfer printing. First is the inability of the current toner delivery system to handle the large quantities of different coloured mineral pigments needed for large runs of ceramic transfers. The second is the poor registration accuracy of the printer's paper feed mechanism. This project will develop the improved machine parts needed to successfully print high volumes of high-quality multi-colour ceramic transfers. The new parts for and improved toner delivery system and more accurate paper feed system will be iteratively developed using digital modelling and 3D printing or laser cutting. The final designs for these parts will be published as open source CAD files on the RCA Repository, allowing other users to create the parts themselves using the same techniques.  The project will also assemble an industry working group to look beyond the currently available technology and define the requirements for a next generation, purpose-built, ceramic pigment digital laser printer. Drawing on the combined expertise of the working group, the project team will draft a comprehensive set of specifications that will respond to the needs of ceramics manufacturers and related industries that could use such machines. It is envisaged that the existence of the working group will also facilitate active partnerships amongst companies in complimentary areas and assist in the dissemination of both projects' outcomes across the members' own professional networks. The open access CAD files will offer immediate material improvements to current printers and the specifications will inform the next generation of specialised digital laser printers. Both these will be available through the RCA's repository and disseminated through a dedicated RCA project webpage. The project team will also present the project's results at trade shows, conferences and ceramic festivals as well as through articles in relevant trade and academic publications.","The Commercial Sector: The main immediate impact beneficiaries will be companies working in the UK ceramic industry, including, but not limited to, the members of the Follow-on Funding project industry working group. This will be immediately delivered through the open access availability of the new toner feed and registration systems, which will allow commercial companies to undertake large-volume accurate print runs. This extended capability, combined with direct access to the research team's work on developing new print methods that are more responsive to the medium's demands and aesthetic possibilities (a key outcome of the previous AHRC funded project), will give these companies a competitive advantage over overseas competitors. Additional beneficiaries will be companies working in related creative industry sectors that share the use of ceramic pigment printing, but who do not currently employ laser printing techniques, and who could adopt the technology if improvements were made. These include the glass decorating and metal decorating industries, for whom an improvement in scales, speeds, economies and visual aesthetics would also boost production capabilities and market potential. New start-ups and SMEs in the creative industries and manufacturing more generally, who are looking to laser printed ceramic technology as a market opportunity beyond the bureaux model for the delivery of ceramic transfers, are part of both the sectors mentioned above. The improvements in equipment function that the project will deliver will support and benefit this growth sector (see 'Innovation Through Craft: Opportunities for Growth', Craft Council 2016) The project's gathering of diverse industry specialists to engage in roundtable discussions focussing on the next generation requirements for a made for purpose ceramic laser printer will provide clear definitions and specifications for further developments to be made to the technology. This knowledge will reach beyond the ceramic sector to benefit commercial companies from other fields such as: mechanical and software engineering as well as toner and transfer paper manufacturers. Individual Technical and Managerial Professionals: The creation of the project working group will facilitate the creation of professional contacts across different parts of the UK's digital printing community that currently have little opportunity for direct engagement. Members of the group will therefore personally benefit from the networking and partnership building the project will encourage, over and above the opportunity to extend their subject knowledge in relation to the technology in question.   Policy Makers: The textual outputs of the project, including: the new machine specification, executive summary, project website and academic papers will all include a section contextualising the project's aims and results. By building on the material from the previous project: ""Extending the Potential of the Digital Ceramic Surface"", these outputs will offer an extended, comprehensive view of industrial perspectives on, and concrete developments in, digital printing technology for the ceramics industry stretching over the past three years. The project will therefore provide sound and referenceable evidence for policy makers engaged in activities related to industrial manufacturing, the digital economy, the creative industries and urban regeneration or development projects (especially the creation or support of urban creative quarters). Individual Practitioners in the Creative Industries: Individual artists and designers working within the disciplines of ceramics, glass, metals and printmaking will benefit from the advances in capability and capacity that the improvements will bring. The improvements in the toner feed system and the registration capability will open up new more sophisticated possibilities for artists in the areas of advanced colour saturation and precision printing.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP012965%2F1

Once licensed by an educational institution, over 200 films can be downloaded by tutors for use in the classroom, on campus or online. Students browse our website, choose an archive film to respond to and request download access to the film, integrating clips of up to two minutes into their own documentaries.  This call provides an exciting opportunity to build on our existing research and research network, working with a project partner, BBC Archive, at the heart of the BBC's centenary events.  BBC Archive currently provides young filmmakers with access to 70 documentaries through the Make Film History project, but we have recently curated a further 80 films to add to the collection on the themes of the Environment, Mental Health and Neurodiversity, and Diversity. Other programmes in the collection focus on the early years of community broadcasting, changing modes of documentary storytelling and production, teenage life and youth culture, career prospects, stories of immigration and the Black British experience. Our proposed project will ask young filmmakers aged 16-30 across the UK to choose a BBC programme from the Make Film History collection and create a short film in response to it.  After initial engagement events in Belfast, Glasgow, Leeds/Bradford and London, young filmmakers will respond to a call for proposals on this theme and fifty participants will be selected to receive mentoring from a professional filmmaker to make their films across these four locations.  The selected filmmakers will shoot new material inspired by the archive film they choose and can include up to two minutes of the archive work in their film. Through creative reuse of the BBC's audio-visual heritage, participants will illuminate the past and reinterpret key moments from BBC history through the lens of a new generation, making it relevant to their lives and communities today, filmed and edited their way.  These fifty new short films will uncover the forgotten histories of underrepresented communities and reflect the full diversity of the UK, engaging local and regional filmmakers and audiences. Much of our public memory is enshrined in BBC programme-making. Now these programmes can be recontextualised by young filmmakers and shared with their communities.  We will follow the successful workshop model we have developed over the past two years and work with existing partners in the Make Film History research network of film festivals, training organisations, research centres and cinemas in Belfast, Glasgow, Leeds and London, as described below.  This project builds on our existing research into the creative reuse of audio-visual heritage in education. Copyright and clearance restrictions and the cost of commercial licensing have previously imposed barriers to creatively reusing audio-visual heritage. By working with our project partners, we have removed these barriers and created a new model for creative reuse by young filmmakers for non-commercial, educational use. 75 higher education institutions and a dozen film festivals and training organisations now access this archival resource.  This an ambitious but very feasible project, built on an innovative, tried and tested research model of creative reuse in education. The audio-visual history of the BBC is at the heart of the project, giving young creatives a manageable selection of films to browse and respond to, creating fifty new short films which reimagine key moments from television history through the eyes of a new generation of filmmakers.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX001156%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              In recent years the advent of digital, CGI and 3D technologies have been heralded as revolutionising our experience of cinema, but these are nothing compared to the impact of new sound technologies in the late 1920s when silent cinema as an art form was subjugated to the spoken and sung word. In Britain the films produced in this transitional period, with the exception of Hitchcock's Blackmail (1929), produced in both silent and sound versions, have been largely overlooked. Early British sound films have suffered from critical denigration due to their supposedly clumsy attempts to deal with the spoken word. However, their reappraisal is now long overdue, particularly in the wider contexts proposed by this study which will look comprehensively, for the first time, at the ways in which British cinema responded to the coming of sound across all aspects of production, exhibition, distribution and reception - from the frenzied international competition to patent and install new sound equipment in studios and cinemas, to the impact on film stars and the thousands of cinema musicians who played to silent films, to the kinds of films that were produced and the critical and popular responses to them.  The economic burden of equipping studios and cinemas for sound required massive domestic and foreign investment and coincided with global recession, the Wall Street Crash and the need for fundamental changes to financial investment in cinema. This project will examine British cinema's response to these conditions alongside the various positive and negative drivers for and against sound cinema; from the increasing influence of popular radio and audiences' desire to hear the sung and spoken word and the various equipment manufacturers competing to dominate global markets, to victims such as the musicians and composers who relied on the cinema for their livelihood, the silent stars whose voices did not respond to the microphone, and the scenarists who wrote intertitles for silent films. In order to carefully periodise this transition, the study will be divided into three key periods corresponding to the project's workplan: 1927-1928 - the period immediately before the arrival of The Jazz Singer in the UK 1929-1930 - the transition between silent and sound when films were made in both formats and the industry experimented with different technologies and methods 1931-1933 - the early sound period when silent cinema technologies and personnel were adapting to the new medium Using this historical framework, the research will investigate and draw together, the following three areas: 1. The British cinema industry and infrastructure in terms of producers, studios and production companies and the changes caused by new sound technologies including the development of studio recording and cinema exhibition technologies, the rush to patent new systems and those who succeeded or failed. The overall effects on businesses and industrial organisations associated with cinema; the winners and losers including impacts on: i. personnel with the rapid need for new skills and the loss of those associated with silent cinema and related changes in the organisation of labour. ii. audiences, cinema-going and the response of press and critics. iii. the source material for new sound cinema. iv. international relations in the spheres of co-production and distribution  2. a critical reappraisal of the films themselves in the light of the above including how film techniques and aesthetics changed and developed over these three periods.  3. historical evidence explaining how 'the talkies' changed British cinema forever and the significance of their legacy.","This study will build upon and extend impacts achieved by the work of the PI in organising the British Silent Film Festival since 1998, and her experience in bringing new research on the first 30 years of British cinema history to wider academic, media and public attention. Participants and audiences range from international academics and public figures to family audiences and children. The Festival has an international profile and an associated multi-disciplinary research community including public academics, music and cinema historians such as Mark Kermode, Neil Brand and Matthew Sweet and a history of engaging with the media including BBC TV and radio, regional and national press; all of which will be approached to maximise the profile and impact of this project. In 2011 the Festival created a precedent for this project in presenting 'The Great British Talking Picture Show' at the Barbican, (Brown and Murphy, 2011) which sparked significant public interest in this period of cinema history. Two four-day public conferences and screenings (2015 and 2017) and a two-day colloquium (2016) will use a similar format in presenting rare films, new research and discoveries and making them accessible to a wide audience spectrum. Through knowledge-exchange and partnership working, this project will benefit: i. Independent cinemas, including those involved directly in delivering this project - Phoenix Square, MacRobert Cinema, The Cinema Museum and BFI Southbank - and those involved in hosting aspects of the project's findings such as screening educational materials and packages. 35 independent cinemas across the UK will be targeted using the BFI Film Hubs to disseminate information about the project. ii. Voluntary sector organisations such as The Cinema Museum will benefit from research into its archive and collections which will be disseminated through events staged there as part of the project including screenings and presentations.  iii. Voluntary sector collections and datasets including BECTU History Project, the CTA and CEA rely on researcher-led contributions and these will benefit from having their datasets referenced, catalogued and promoted. iv. Teachers of cinema studies in schools will have access to teaching materials produced and disseminated from this project in collaboration with Film Nation and Film Club. v. independent and private archives benefit from their having their collections and materials promoted. vi.The BFI National and Scottish Screen Archives will benefit from qualitative and quantitative research into their collections and subsequent cataloguing and disseminating of their films. v. Future cinema and social historians will inherit more coherent and accessible datasets.  vi. Local cinema historians and study groups will benefit from the value attached to their work from this project.  Members of the project's research team have experience in presenting cinema history research to libraries, special interest groups, adult and University of the Third Age learners, and as part of local cinema education and screening programmes. The project will promote its findings among such groups, offering bespoke talks and presentations.  This study will also re-appraise and re-evaluate the significant output of early British sound films, largely held by the BFI, which have had only rare public screenings, and bring them back to public and critical attention, not only in terms of their qualities as films, but for their significance in working with the new sound technologies and what they reveal about the choices made and the avenues explored by the British industry during this period. A direct beneficiary of this will be the international community of interested public and film historians for whom access to this material is limited, and the 250 or so films in the BFI National Collection covering this period which merit a higher profile and fuller integration into future studies of British cinema.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013800%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This Follow-On Funding project will develop a course in practical philosophy, along with supporting materials like handouts and videos, which will then be trialled in three different organisations: in Scottish prisons through Motherwell College; in Manor Gardens, a London mental health charity; and in Saracens rugby club. We will then collect feedback from the participants in these organisations to see what benefit they got from it, and whether it affected their sense of resilience and well-being. We'll write up our findings in an AHRC report, and also present them in a seminar to other academics interested in taking philosophy beyond academia and into other areas of adult education.  If this pilot project is a success, we will then seek further funding for Stage 2 (not covered by this grant), which would establish a social enterprise to sell courses in practical philosophy to private-sector organisations, while also providing them at a subsidized rate for more disadvantaged groups such as mental health charities.  The project follows on from an AHRC-funded research project in 2012, called 'Philosophical Communities', which researched the history and contemporary rise of grassroots philosophy clubs around the world. That report noted the remarkable growth of grassroots philosophy clubs, with over 1000 such clubs listed on meetup.com, and the number of people signed up to such clubs growing at an annual rate of 30%. The report generated a lot of media interest, with articles on grassroots philosophy appearing in the Financial Times, the New York Times, La Reppublica, El Confidencial and Dong-a llbo in South Korea. This project will take that research into new territory, taking it from the theoretical to the practical. What impact does practical philosophy have on people outside of academia? What benefits do they feel they get from it? Is it commercially viable to sell such courses to companies, as a means not just for improving employee resilience, but also for enhancing character? Can practical philosophy courses enhance the ethical culture of organisations? And does philosophy only appeal to middle-class university graduates, or is it also accessible and useful to more disadvantaged groups?","The project would have the following outcomes:  1) Create and test-out an eight-week practical philosophy course with three different partners.  2) Prepare supplementary materials which can be used in future courses.  3) Collect feedback in the form of qualitative and quantitative forms (the quantitative forms would measure basic well-being factors such as levels of stress, happiness and self-determination, as well as satisfaction with the course).  4) Prepare report for AHRC and present findings to researchers and practitioners at a London event.  5) Consider whether to proceed with Stage 2 by launching a social enterprise for the commercial sale of the course to private-sector, public sector and third sector organisations. Consider also the possible avenues for funding of Stage 2 (including RSA Catalyst funding and potentially a larger AHRC follow-on grant).  6) More broadly, the project would widen interest in philosophy, and create advocates for philosophy in various different industries and sectors. It would also join up academic philosophy to other sectors, particularly to charities and public-sector organisations.  The project would benefit the following groups:  - The primary beneficiaries would be the participants in the courses, who would get the benefit of learning practical techniques for resilience, while also having a space to discuss and explore what flourishing means for them. The course would hopefully enhance their health, well-being, and flourishing. The feedback from the one-off workshops Jules Evans has done has been very positive (see a feedback form from Epsom Library, in the attachments, as an example) and we anticipate a similarly positive response to a longer and more structured course.  - The project would create an evidence base for the course's effectiveness, by taking quantitative and qualitative feedback from the course participants, in the form of well-being questionnaires and brief interviews.  - The project would also serve as a pilot for the possible expansion of the course through the creation of a social enterprise. This would greatly increase the impact of the course.  - We hope the course will prove useful to other organisations similar to our three partners - to prisons, mental health charities, NHS well-being centres, schools, universities and further education colleges.  -Already, some British schools have informally and independently run philosophy work-shops based on some of our material, and reported back excellent results (see the attachments for a letter from one-teacher).  - We also hope the course will prove popular with private-sector organisations, by highlighting the link between stress management and ethics, or between resilience and character.  - The course is already of interest to policy-makers interested in teaching well-being in schools and adult education, including Anthony Seldon, headmaster of Wellington College; James O'Shaughnessy, former head of the Number 10 Policy Unit; and Lord Richard Layard, one of the developers of Improving Access for Psychological Therapies in the NHS; all of whom have spoken of their interest in practical philosophy courses that teach virtue ethics and connect it to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (see attachments for their comments). It fits well the growing 'politics of well-being' movement.  - The course is likely to attract international interest, with our book and blog-posts on practical philosophy already informally inspiring courses in schools and universities in Brazil, Lebanon, Holland, Poland, the US and South Korea (see attachment for emails from some of these).  - More broadly, we hope the course will help people flourish, while promoting a 'thinking culture' in the public. And we hope it will connect academic philosophy to non-academic audiences, revitalizing public interest in philosophy and creating advocates for philosophy.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013835%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The proposed project, Exploring Outreach through Medieval Seals (ExOMS), will offer an important test-case approach to the ways in which an involved academic research project can be also applied beyond its immediate academic audience. The proposed project draws upon the AHRC-funded Seals in Medieval Wales (SiMeW) project and will reapply material and expertise gathered in that project and place it in new settings. In particular, it seeks to respond to the following identified aims of this funding stream, namely,  - To enhance the value and benefits of AHRC-funded research beyond academia  - To encourage and facilitate a range of interactions and creative engagements between arts and humanities research and a variety of other user communities, including, in this instance, third sector and heritage, voluntary and community groups and the general public. The project also anticipates interaction with business and commercial interests. The SiMeW project team are exceptionally well-placed to provide an effective link between a variety of interested but not as yet interconnected parties. As the largest and most significant publically-funded seal recording project ever undertaken in the UK, SiMeW has unique experience of recording and analysing seals in a digital context which can be shared with the totality of the sigillographic research community in the UK. In contrast to many previous projects, SiMeW has not been restricted to a particular collection or repository, but has worked with material held by repositories ranging from local record offices to the British Library, and as such has an understanding of the challenge of merging sigillographic data from different institutions. Moreover, SiMeW has gathered material from a range of different types of collections, such as records of monastic houses and private estates, each with contrasting characteristics. Finally, SiMeW recorded seals from c.1150 to 1550, providing a remarkable overview of the surviving medieval material. All of these highly positive developments can be brought to the benefit of academic and non-academic end-users. The proposed work for ExOMS will significantly extend the outreach of the current project and will do so by addressing a number of separate cohorts as well as discrete kinds of activity. The project team consider this to be an excellent opportunity to disseminate the original research beyond an academic community and ensure that the benefits of the research will reach a number of different end-users. With further funding through ExOMS, the current SiMeW team will reach out to the diverse community of academic researchers, heritage professionals, local and family historians, metal-detectorists, educationalists, businesses and living history enthusiasts that we know are keen to engage with sigillographic material. The follow-on funding will enable the team to foster interdisciplinary dialogue and offer the benefit of our experience working with this material in terms of technological and methodological solutions to the challenge of making sigillographic information available to the widest variety of users. In so doing, it is an aspiration of the project team that, just as with the original project which is identified as a model in sigillographic studies, the proposed project will offer a novel and important instance of the ways in which high-quality archival research and associated outputs can be employed in exciting and constructive ways in the wider community.","The project team anticipate that impact will be achieved through the following: i. The proposed website content will be aimed at providing information and assistance to the widest possible range of users. This is intended to extend understanding within groups beyond academia of the value and potential of seals as a source for the study of medieval society, including local historians, conservators, archivists, and other interested individuals/groups, including any relevant commercial outlets. Content will include: - A guide to describing seals, based on the SiMeW template and controlled vocabulary, and with images to assist with recording; - Information on the ways in which seals can be used for a wide range of historical studies, with examples from the SiMeW project; - Hyperlinks to other relevant materials/resources as part of an attempt to integrate approaches and share best practice. Impact will be observable through uptake of relevant materials by interest groups, and through the use of resources made available on-line by the project, including a relevant taxonomy, and in associated further contact and outreach activities as developed and enhanced through that contact. ii. In addition to the development of a point of contact and a node for the sharing of expertise and best practice, the other significant outputs of the project will relate to targeted engagement intended to foster awareness, understanding and informed use of this important resource, In terms of the present proposal and impact beyond academic institutions and their immediate partners, in three main areas: primary and secondary education, local history and heritage groups, business and commercial activity. - Education: The SiMeW project is piloting approaches to engagement with primary school education (key stage 2) through dedicated workshops linked to its main exhibition at the National Library of Wales (NLW); the proposed follow-on funding project will seek to extend that contact and pursue ways of formalising that engagement by making its expertise and material available to curriculum designers and through an extension of its current activity with direct contact with schools, within Wales in this instance and through the creation of an activity pack pitched at appropriate curricula levels and devised in consultation with colleagues in education (including Aberyswyth University). Impact assessment: observable through evident use of SiMeW materials at teaching level and through more general and consistent adoption of relevant materials and approaches in relevant curricula. - Local History and heritage contacts: the project team will contact and seek opportunities to attend and to present at a series of meeting that will both deepen and widen pre-existing contacts. Impact assessment: observable through engagement 'on the day' and in follow-up activity, including reference back to and further use of project material, notably material on-line. - Commercial activity: An important aim of the proposed project is to explore opportunities for interface with business; the project team will engage with 'seals-kit' manufacturers and other heritage-related businesses with a view to adding their expertise into design and construction. Important in this will be an attempt to facilitate discussion between archives and manufacturers in ways that will promote economic opportunity within both the private and public sectors. In attempting this, the project team will work closely with Aberystwyth University's commercialisation and consultancy service with a view to developing such opportunities as well as pursuing the more general principle that such engagement is realisable for medievalists working with what are often perceived as quite remote and intractable sources. Impact assessment: observable through contact between commercial outlets and academic/archival 'providers', leading to successful and appropriate business opportunities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK002910%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The production of salt has been a vital commodity for human life for millennia. Of crucial importance for preserving foodstuffs and thus allowing them to be exported, salt has been at the heart of successful civilizations, allowing the growth of city states and feeding their armies on campaign. This project seeks to investigate the role of salt production in Ireland's efforts to extend her commerce to a global market (in particular the transatlantic colonies - Mandelblatt 2007). Unlike neighbouring Britain, Ireland was never subject to large-scale industrial development, but nevertheless had a thriving export trade in salted beef and butter which stimulated economic growth from the seventeenth century (Rynne 2006). The importance of salt stems therefore from its crucial role in the burgeoning provisions trade which in turn facilitated economic expansion in the post-medieval era. Despite the importance of salt production for underpinning the economy, there has been almost no field-based research focussing on the commodity. The result is a lack of knowledge concerning the scale and survival of sites associating with salt making and almost no archaeological evidence of the technology and material culture of the industry in Ireland. The paucity of previous work necessitates the project investigate the subject at both national and local scales, providing a context to understand the scale and geography of salt production and allowing focussed investigation on an important, recently discovered site of early salt production.  The national scale investigation will collate evidence from a wide range of cartographic and documentary sources to generate a comprehensive distribution (GIS package) of salt working sites. A significant sample of sites identified in this way will be selected for field visits aimed at recording and understanding the archaeological expression of salt working at different locations. This will provide an overview of the structures associated with salt production as well as features (e.g. brine reservoirs) that may be located within the vicinity and their relationship with regional ports. Of particular interest is whether any of the sites demonstrate combined industrial processes such as lime and kelp-making with salt production - a documented innovation that seems to have been unique to Ireland. The national framework will establish Irish salt making within a north European context, aid interpretation of excavation results (see below) and inform future research agendas. The project will specifically reveal through targeted excavation the unique remains of the earliest salt-working sites on the Irish coast - that at Ballycastle Bay in Co. Antrim. Three salt-working sites have been discovered in the Bay, bearing witness to three centuries of production (17th-19th centuries). Drawing on the large adjacent coalfield for fuel, the complex is the longest continuous site of salt production in the country. The main focus of the excavation will be on the recently discovered eastern site. This site is the earliest in the Bay, and may have its origins under MacDonnell ownership in the 16th century. The dig will ascertain a more accurate foundation date for the works, assess the level of technological sophistication in place, and provide insights into the material culture and working conditions of the 17th century salt workers. A secondary excavation will take place at the latest, western site, which uniquely preserves the iron pans used to evaporate brine. In this case the pans are in danger from erosion and archaeological investigation will be followed by work to stabilise and cover the site.  Drawing on a multi-scale approach, this project is the first attempt to investigate one of Ireland's most important post-medieval industries. The work will examine one of the most significant sites of salt production in the country, presenting a unique opportunity to provide new insights on the industry.","A number of organisations and sectors will benefit from the proposed project. These include: International organisations - The research will be of interest to a number of international bodies, for example ECOSAL Atlantis - a European initiative to promote sustainable tourism based on the cultural and natural heritage of traditional salt-producing areas of the Atlantic (principally Portugal, Spain France and the UK). The UK-based partners have shown an active interest in the Ballycastle sites, visiting them in 2012. This project will underpin the enhancement of information available for this initiative to promote our European heritage. The result will integrate Irish evidence with the rest of the European Atlantic seaboard and make information available on site and through international media. Government - The project will have contributions to make to those sectors of government responsible for the protection of cultural heritage in both jurisdictions of Ireland. The cross-border scope of the proposal provides a connected view of salt-making across the island and highlights its international networks. The findings of the survey will be made available to government departments (specifically the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and the Dept. of Heritage and the Gaeltacht) for inclusion in their Sites and Monuments Records. The research will also be used to petition policy-makers for greater attention to be paid to post-medieval monuments (see Pathways to Impact). On a more local scale the work will inform the management plan for the Causeway coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which the Ballycastle sites lie. Professional / practitioner groups - groups expected to benefit from the research include archaeological organisations with an interest in post-medieval and industrial heritage such as the Irish Post-Medieval Archaeology Group (IPMAG - the PI is a committee member), the Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology (SPMA) and the Society for Historical Archaeology (SHA). The results of the work will enhance knowledge of the salt-working and its material culture for practitioners in the field. Media interest (television, national newspaper and radio) in maritime archaeology across Ireland has been considerable and sustained - there is every expectation that this project would also attract attention from both the national and regional media. Museums will have an interest in the findings of the excavation work, particularly those in the local area. Causeway Museums Service has a track record of interest in the industrial history of the area, with a number of past exhibitions on the theme. Their 1613-2013 Project exploring the legacy of Plantation will be directly relevant to the excavation work. Moyle Council is also planning a McDonnell Heritage Trail in which the salt works will be a significant point of interest. The project has the potential to enhance similar educational initiatives in the future. The local community has a thriving historical society and a number of enthusiastic individuals who have expressed great interest in the findings of the work. Some of these members carried out preliminary identifications of the salt-working sites and so have a long-standing interest in the topic. Talks, tours and workshops will be offered to these groups either as a stand-alone event or as part of the wider commemorations planned by local agencies (e.g. museums) in the next two years.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL002175%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Literary writers have often seen their poems, plays, essays and novels censored on grounds of offence, blasphemy, libel, political sedition or obscenity and they have also often been eloquent defenders of the right to free expression. This project investigates the intimate relationship between literature and free speech, but focuses on its particular features in twentieth and twenty-first century history. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948, insisted on the 'right to freedom and expression...regardless of frontiers'. But writers had, since the 1920s, been claiming that, literature 'knows no frontiers', as the organisation International PEN put it in 1927 and that the dissemination, readership and future significance of literary works could not be owned by nation states.  The relationship between literature, censorship and free expression has been of considerable and longstanding interest to lawyers and legal scholars, (Thomas [2007], Dhavan [2008]), literary critics (Pease [2000], McDonald [2009]) and intellectual historians, (Collini [2010], Darnton [2014]. Recent histories of human rights, meanwhile, have analysed the cultural battles over what was 'universal' about rights in the lead up to the UDHR, and its subsequent history (Moyn [2010], Mazower [2009, 2012]). The specific relationship between literature and rights, meanwhile, has also been of considerable interest (Hunt [2007], Slaughter [2007], Anker [2012]). This project engages with this wider body of scholarship, but shifts the terms of the debate. It argues that in order to understand the impact of twentieth and twenty-first century writers on understandings of free expression it is necessary to analyse different sites of cultural exchange, looking beyond governments, law and declarations,. This project argues that the non-governmental writers' organisation has also played a crucial role.  It focuses on one writers' organisation, International PEN, but also looks at associated organisations in its three key areas of focus: the UK, South Africa and India. International PEN was founded in London in 1921 but quickly expanded, with centres springing up across Europe and the US in 1922 and 1923, and in China (1924), Canada (1926), South Africa (1927), Argentina (1930), India (1933), Japan and Brazil (1934), amongst many others. Its members have included some of the most prominent writers of the long twentieth century, including Rabindranath Tagore, Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, and Salman Rushdie. Many member writers have had their works censored; and many of them have written influential essays, poems, plays or novels reflecting on the boundaries of free expression.  Not only have these writers, and these writers' organisations, engaged intellectually with attacks on free speech; they have also influenced government policies, international charters and legal interpretations through campaigning, educational and translation initiatives. When PEN began in the 1920s its internationalism entailed an expansionist and supposedly apolitical spirit of international 'friendliness' through encounters with writers from other cultures. The organisation's understanding of internationalism, however, soon changed, firstly in its attempt to protect the 'international' rights of exiled and persecuted German and East European writers in the 1930s, and then in the fierce internal disagreements over whether PEN should defend the right to free expression of Nazi and Fascist collaborators such as Ezra Pound and Knut Hamsun. No less controversial was the organisation's securing international financial and legal influence after acquiring consultative status to UNESCO and the UN in the late 1940s and its subsequent role in the cold war when a humanist 'internationalism' became deeply politicised. The project aims to produce a comprehensive account of the organisation in order to understand what international free expression means today.","This project has been developed with its project partner, International PEN, as well as its centres in South Africa and India. Specifically we will liaise with James Tennant (publishing) and Sarah Clarke (UN liaison) at International P.E.N; Margie Orford, President of South African PEN, Board Member of International PEN and actively linked into the PEN Africa network; and Ranjit Hoskote, Secretary of All-India PEN. The main impact of the research will be on the writers' organisations themselves and their members. The current concerns of PEN centres, in turn, have informed our key research objectives. The histories of Indian PEN and South African P.E.N. are unrecorded. They consider our project to be vital to the preservation of India's and South Africa's literary history.  The further impact of the project resides in its influence on writers, publishers and activists in the areas of translation and free speech activism. Impact will operate at two broad levels:  1. The use of historical knowledge to understand the present and open up new perspectives on the future:   - Collaboration and intellectual exchange will be important at the level of the archival work itself. Liaising with our project partner we will bring to light and catalogue boxes of unanalysed manuscripts, letters and committee minutes at Theosophy Hall, Mumbai, the South African PEN centre, and the International PEN offices in London.  - Interviews with current activists and writers and publishers will be central to our analysis of recent free expression events and debates; again, the close collaboration of academics, writers and activists in the process of these interviews will embed impact into the project.  - The International Conferences on Free Expression, to be held in London (Free Word Centre), Cape Town (D6 Museum) and Mumbai (PEN offices) will facilitate dialogue between the project's research and the expertise and experience of the project partner, as well as other activists, publishers and writers.  - The Conference proceedings will be published in a co-edited book that will be aimed at a broad, non-academic International readership interested in questions of free expression and literature.  2. The project's three key geo-political areas of study give it three central zones of impact, all with particular concerns to be addressed:  - Orford looks to the project to address the multilingual contexts of free expression issues in South Africa. Global questions around the prosecution of writers for insult and criminal defamation are, in the context of South Africa, also questions of translation, particularly of words such as insult, hatred and free expression.  - In India, writers have been silenced in face of death threats, book burnings, and vandalizing of bookshops. Indian PEN seeks to understand 'the use of India's laws to suppress free speech' , especially Sections 153 and 295A of the Indian Penal Code, inherited from the British Raj, that makes hurting religious or communal sentiments a criminal offense. Our project, by exploring the historical use and misuse of this legislation to curb freedom of expression, will help Indian PEN to formulate a response to the vocabulary of 'hurt' or 'injury' in practices of literary regulation in India.  - The International PEN and the national PEN centres themselves are part of a network of other related or affiliated organisations, so that the knowledge unveiled through the project will have an impact beyond its immediate partners. International PEN is connected to other organisations, such as the UN, and student PEN centres in Oxford and King's College London, as well as to a global network of PEN centres. In South Africa PEN, has strong links with the PEN Africa network, and there is already an established connection between South African PEN and the School of Journalism at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, and specifically to the Justice Project.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN008782%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The proposed network brings together 23 international experts from 11 countries, with a view to investigating cyclic developments in the history of a range of languages from different families. Linguistic cycles are recurrent patterns of language change taking place in a structured manner. They have inherent direction, typically involving the renewal of a particular linguistic item/element of a linguistic construction by an incoming form, but also in some instances changes internal to a given item or construction.  Probably the most widely known example of a cyclic development is the so-called Jespersen Cycle (Jespersen 1917), which has been observed in many different languages at different periods. Here, an item functioning as a marker of standard negation in a given language (e.g. Old French preverbal ne) is first optionally accompanied by an additional marker in certain contexts (e.g. postverbal pas/mie in OF). Eventually, the newer marker becomes obligatory, and the older one starts to drop out, and may disappear completely. The newer marker may then move into the slot that used to be occupied by the older marker in some or all contexts (thus, pas is now preverbal in infinitival clauses). Schematically: (i) ne Verb > ne V (pas) > ne V pas > (ne) V pas > V pas > pas V In other cases, the original negative marker merges with the newer one (e.g. Old Latin ne + oenum 'not one' > non). Several cycles may be completed within the same language or across mother-daughter languages, as has happened across Latin and French. While it has been known since the early 20th c. that cyclic developments can be found at the level of (morpho)syntactic change (i.e. grammar), recent research (Ghezzi/Molinelli eds 2014, Hansen 2018, fc, Hansen ed fc) has revealed that cycles also occur in the domain of semantics and pragmatics (i.e. meaning), at hitherto unsuspected levels of granularity. Thus, for instance, both the by now obsolete Old French adverb/conjunction ainz and the Modern French adverb plutôt have successively undergone change from expressing temporal anteriority ('earlier'/'sooner') to expressing subjective preference ('rather'), and from there to expressing correction (Hansen fc). Network members will study a number of specific cases of cyclicity from across a wide range of languages, in order to obtain a better understanding of the nature of different types of cycles and their place within a broader theory of language change. In particular, we will investigate how and to what extent cycles belonging to different levels of linguistic description may interrelate. Our working hypothesis is that cycles are pragmatically driven by default. We will develop this line of thought within a usage-based approach to language, which is particularly well suited to accounting for pragmatic influences at the level of both grammar and lexicon. As cross-linguistic patterns, cyclical forms of change can provide a window on basic building blocks of human cognition and/or interpersonal behavior. What are the cognitive domains from which the source elements are recruited? What is the nature of the forces that keep the cycle moving? By exploring these questions, the proposed network will seek to uncover possible linguistic and/or cognitive (quasi-)universals in the process. Members will present findings in the context of two small-scale team workshops and one international open-call, refereed conference. In addition, findings will be shared in the form of an edited volume/special issue published in a high-profile outlet. The international open-call conference will serve to raise interest in cyclic language change within the scholarly community and help pave the way for future international collaborations on this topic. We will also set up a website featuring, among other things, an evolving bibliography of relevant research. Finally, we will engage non-academic audiences through a popular-science paper.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV008080%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project follows on from research funded by the AHRC Cultural Value programme which identified a need for small and medium sized organisations in the creative and cultural industries to have resources enabling them to conduct research to develop their audience, participation and programmes.  Current research resources available within the creative industries do not account for the complexities of the value-based decision making involved in meeting the needs of current or potential audiences, consumers and participants. While some online and paper-based training resources for creative organisations are available, these tend to be quantitative and 'hard data'-driven for marketing purposes. Such research tools do not provide the know-how and skills to analyse qualitative research data. Small- and medium-sized creative organisations need research know-how and skills to inform their planning and development, and their funding applications. Our experience is that very often small- and medium- sized creative organisations either do not have the specialist research skills, or do not have the money to employ a specialist research agency to generate and analyse research data. The project will co-create a qualitative research toolkit in the form of a website for audience/consumer/participant research with and for small- and medium-sized creative organisations. This co-creation process will include Creative Scotland, its clients and potential clients, other funders, charities, policymakers and academics. This includes nine named partner organisations who will actively take part in research on their own practices in relation to audience development in order to inform the toolkit.  The aim of the project is to develop a 'research habit' among creative organisations, which will enhance their ability to develop meaningful programmes of work to retain existing audiences and attract new audiences, and demonstrate this understanding of their audiences and potential audiences to potential funders and supporters.  The research team will use tastemaking and cultural value as an innovative and flexible research framework within which to co-create the toolkit's content. This framework has been tried and tested in the PI's Cultural Value study and the PI's three subsequent studies funded by the University of Edinburgh. The framework allows exploration of co-creators' organisational and artistic practices, assisting understanding of where audience/consumer/participant development fits within the organisation's planning and development process. The framework also allows the research team to explore how audience/consumer/participant development practices are informed by the values and tastes of the different organisations' various stakeholder perspectives. This understanding will underpin the toolkit with a depth of knowledge of creative organisations' audience/consumer/participant development research needs that currently-available resources do not provide.","This Impact Summary addresses two questions: Who might benefit from this research? How might they benefit from this research?   This Follow on Funding proposal is targeted at direct application of research to benefit small and medium sized creative organizations that:  - wish to refine their understanding of their audiences, stakeholders, or participants using qualitative rather than quantitative approaches  - lack financial resource to buy-in specialist research support  - lack in-house expertise in research and wish to develop this area  - wish to complement existing quantitative approaches with more nuanced qualitative data The creative organisations particularly targeted are in the subsidised rather than the commercial sector and with the inclusion of one collective, and three organisations which rent out multidisciplinary studio space, we encompass all six of Creative Scotland's portfolio industry categories (theatre, dance, music, film, visual arts and literature and publishing). Creative Scotland, as a funder, will also be a beneficiary of this project. The resulting toolkit will be freely available under a Creative Commons license, so both larger creative organisations and those from the commercial sector can also benefit from the proposed outputs. This proposed project will benefit creative organisations by enabling better informed decision-making leading to creative outputs and activities that will attract and engage new, and further develop existing, audiences/consumers/participants. The ability to undertake useful, precisely targeted and relevant qualitative research in-house will enhance understanding of the values and tastes of an organisation's different stakeholders, and both current and potential audiences/consumers/participants. It could be fundamentally important to organisational development and providing best value for funders. The proposal will have an impact on organisational development, skills and know-how by (1) engendering in its participants an organisational 'research habit' and practical research know-how; (2) providing access to a set of tools that have been co-created, tested and piloted with different creative organizations, are easily used by non-specialists specially designed to be fit for purpose, flexible and adaptable to different art forms; and (3) providing training in the use of the toolkit including implementation and interpretation of data. The outcome of organisations' research activity will be collection and informed interpretation of rigorously-collected and nuanced data to inform both organisational and audience/consumer/ participant strategy and development, provide evidence of audience/consumer/participant reach and potential for funders, and broaden the scope of available funding through evidence of appeal to a broader demographic. While there are numerous online and training resources available, these are mainly quantitatively based, for example MOSAIC profiling or tools that work, for example, with postcode data from box-office returns. Anecdotal evidence from Creative Scotland and small and medium creative organisations (particularly those that are not venue-based), identifies that there is a need for flexible qualitative research tools. In co-creating our toolkit with Creative Scotland, and actual and potential users, we will develop content, that meets a range of sector needs.  The impact of the toolkit will be sustained beyond the life of the project. The research team, together with their creative collaborators, will seek to build a community around research that will make the toolkit self-sustaining in the future.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP013201%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project explores the strategic importance of translation and interpreting in the early reception and resettlement phases of selected groups of asylum seekers and refugees in England since the 1940s, with specific reference to non-state actors. It seeks to investigate the overall question of how limited language proficiency has been accommodated in services, against the backdrop of increasingly 'technologised' humanitarian activity and changes in attitude to migration and linguistic diversity over the period. Specifically it will 1) investigate the relationship between the government and selected charities in supporting linguistically and culturally diverse groups of refugees and asylum seekers since the 1940s; 2) trace the development of language provisions by indigenous and community-based groups; 3) explore attitudinal shifts to linguistic diversity in government and civil society discourse, and 4) elicit personal and organisational experiences of language provisions in two city-based case studies. The project traces the evolution of public service translation and interpreting in Britain and is anchored around the processes of what theorists of cultural studies term 'articulation' (Slack 1996). This is understood as the ways in which a state reaches out to others to encourage particular types of social engagement in return. As refugee and asylum movements have accelerated and become 'superdiverse' (Vertovec 2007), and communities have settled, processes of articulation have also evolved, warranting attention to the role played by translation and interpreting therein.  Interconnections between humanitarian action, non-state actors and articulation are foregrounded in this project in ways that complement research in translation studies, urban multilingualism and the emerging field of non-state humanitarianism. The project's multidisciplinary team will conduct a set of case studies over the two-year project, and a corpus-based analysis of policy, parliamentary and media discourses. It promotes an epistemological approach based on recent research on urban multilingualism in which language provisions are evaluated in ways that are anchored around local communities of practice and accumulated knowledge and experience, with the communicative event at the centre (Gaiser and Matras 2017).  The first set of case studies is designed to bring to prominence the ways in which selected voluntary sector organisations handled linguistic and cultural diversity in relation to the reception and resettlement of individuals caught up in major refugee events since the 1940s. Archival research at the national archives will yield insight into the principles that underpinned organizational approaches, complemented by research at selected local historical archives to explore practices on the ground in reception centres and camps. A second set of city-based case studies (Leicester and Liverpool) will shed light on the ways in which language provisions emerged at the municipal level, and the networks of community associations that grew organically to complement 'top down' provisions and/or develop independent sources of support. Leicester has been selected due to the role it played in accommodating new arrivals from Uganda in the early 1970s and Liverpool for its connection to Vietnamese refugees in the 1970s and 1980s. The linguistic heterogeneity of the communities in both cases is of particular interest to this project since it will focus attention on the level of flexibility at the local level to respond to need. The two-year project will lead to a series of traditional academic outputs of benefit to a range of academic disciplines and include a symposium, website resources, oral history testimonies and journal articles. The project will also engage with non-academic beneficiaries through workshops and events that are co-organised with refugee community groups, charities, and supplementary schools.","The project will benefit a range of academic and non-academic beneficiaries. In addition to impact through traditional academic routes of dissemination (peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and preparation for a monograph subsequent to the project), other types of impact are described here. A) Not-for-profit organisations and supporting bodies (such as the Greater Manchester Centre for Voluntary Activity) that engage in and organise events that would benefit from drawing on the findings of the case studies. Particular benefits derive from project insights into partnership work with government agencies in asylum and refugee services, the practical organisation of language support and understanding the impact of practice on individuals and communities. By collaborating with such organisations and building on the project team members' work in this sector, the dissemination work will promote greater understanding within the sector of the differences between volunteer and professional language support services, and the need for strategic planning of such services to meet multilingual service needs. Many assume that language support provisions are a relatively new phenomenon and that speaking two languages automatically leads to effective translation practice. Historical perspectives will support better understanding of how attitudes to multilingualism have evolved and how language support services can support organisational response to the safety and security of vulnerable individuals.  B) Community initiatives that seek to raise cultural awareness and promote heritage language maintenance to later generations of migrants. In this regard, the project will contribute to the range of activities offered to supplementary schools through the Multilingual Manchester initiative. Specifically, the second case study will be the springboard for engagement with the Vietnamese Community Association in Manchester that runs a supplementary school. The project will support the development of a template and resources (made available through the project website) for initiatives in other similar schools in Manchester and beyond, through which students will learn about translation and interpreting. It will generate potential for students to develop skills that will support future intercultural interactions and employability. C) The general public will be interested in the findings of the case studies as they will help to demystify the nature of multilingualism and language support provisions. Access to information will be provided through the project website for this purpose. Additionally, a small exhibition at the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Centre, Manchester, will run from May-August 2020. This will help inform the public about the role of translation and interpreting, challenging the many myths that are present in public discourses about what their purpose is.  D) Trainee language services professionals will benefit from the case studies and project website as these will support understanding of the role of the statutory and voluntary sector in handling matters concerning asylum and refugee reception and resettlement. For trainees (current and recent graduates in translation studies), the opportunity to attend the proposed workshops will support meaningful engagement with the statutory and voluntary sector. Relatedly, current MA students will be actively involved (at no cost to the project) in developing project materials and contributing to the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Centre's website. Links to other training programmes will build on the PI's recent role as visiting lecturer to the University of Graz, highlighting the relevance of the project findings for understanding multilingual practice in non-state humanitarian activity in Austria.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR012695%2F1

These ethnobotanical collections can languish as museum professionals struggle with how to research and curate them. Considering the interplay between natural history and ethnography collections, this project builds on a re-emerging interest in indigenous ecology and the value of ethnobotanical collections as material archives of indigenous ecological knowledge. Situating itself within current debates on decolonising the practice and method of museum work, this project aims to create a conversation between academics, researchers, museum professionals, botanists, and indigenous knowledge holders to establish the relevance of these collections in the present, and their potential applications for the future. Three two-day workshops will be held during 2021/22 at The Powell-Cotton Museum in Kent, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and National Museums Scotland. The project is a partnership between researchers at these three organisations. The project is also in partnership with the Museum Ethnographers Group (MEG) and the Natural Sciences Collections Association (NatSCA), both recognized subject specialist networks (SSN) within the museum sector. We will involve representatives of heritage and environmental organisations including the Museu Goeldi in Brazil, the National Museum of Australia, the Australian Tropical Herbarium, and NOMAD project in the UK which works with engaging Somali communities in heritage projects. The project will benefit from the connections of these SSNs, museums and community groups through their ability to shape and inform museum practice in relation to these interdisciplinary collections.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW000385%2F1

This paper proposes four priority lines of enquiry (see Fig.1) as part of a scoping study that will bring together existing knowledge and data in order to set the foundations towards a larger scale research programme. This scoping study will make recommendations and propose lines of enquiry that should form part of a longitudinal study (ideally, five to ten years on) into the medium to long term impact of creative clustering. As argued extensively by Garcia (2004, 2010, 2016) understanding the multiple impacts of regeneration requires a long term view: cities like Glasgow post 1990, Barcelona post 1992 or Liverpool post 2008 offer clear examples of how some of the most remarkable (and sustainable) benefits of culture-led regeneration occur five to ten years on and come in a diversity of forms. The 'successes' we now associate with these cities could not have been appropriately captured via short term 'one year-on' evaluation exercises. Further, the reasons for these 'successes' and their sustainability have never been fully explained. This is largely due to the fact that we lack information about each of these cities' points of departure. This is study is the first of its kind to document the impact and legacies of creative clustering from the outset, thus bringing a unique opportunity to capture impacts 'in the making'.  This proposal assumes CED stakeholders are proceeding with a baseline study to document their activities and populate key benchmark indicators. The value of the study is to provide additional lines of enquiry to capture the more complex dimensions of impact and document the development of medium to long term legacies as they happen. It is timely for the AHRC to lead the way funding such work, given the growing acceptance that the arts and humanities provide much needed complementary tools to capture - and explain - the full range of benefits and challenges surrounding accelerated urban change. As such, this proposal combines established social science methodologies with an arts and humanities methodological lens.  Following on the model developed by Dr Beatriz Garcia within Impacts 08 (European Capital of Culture Research Programme, 2010) and the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad evaluation (2013), the four proposed areas of enquiry and associated methodologies do interrelate. The chosen research leads will thus coordinate methodologies, data gathering and analysis of findings to ensure a holistic approach to final reporting. The final report will draw together all findings, identify synergies and produce a set of joint recommendations to inform AHRC as well as, potentially, other funders' priorities.",To be included,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR003114%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Global challenge. The value of our social and cultural heritage cannot be overestimated as it affects the direction of our development as humans. How to understand and preserve it is a fundamental question in modern science. Centuries of archaeological investigation has produced millions of artefacts that are part of this heritage and are classified and analysed by human experts, presenting a huge challenge to process and interpret all these remains. We aim to meet this challenge using artificial intelligence to create an unprecedented system for automated artefact classification and collation which can be used by non-specialists, allowing experts to focus on analysing these artefacts for greater understandings of the past.   Specific challenge. The Roman period is exceptionally rich archaeologically. The millions of artefacts from across the Roman world are infinitely more informative about people's lives than iconic monuments. However, these artefacts are currently under-utilised in studies of social practices - particularly the wealth of ceramic tablewares used by almost everyone from senator to slave. This under-utilisation is largely due to these artefacts' extensiveness and inherent difficulties in recording them all. For decades ceramics have been recorded and analysed selectively (e.g. only diagnostic sherds of specific vessel types) for chronological sequencing of individual excavations, or for investigating trade patterns between regions, rather than to answer socio-cultural questions, e.g. how were particular vessels used and in what circumstances. More comprehensive recording can facilitate consumption-oriented analyses for new levels of understanding of varying social practices among the diverse communities that made up the Roman world. This project develops a state-of-the art image-recognition and machine-learning service, Arch-I-Scan, a proof-of-concept experiment of which was successfully carried out for the AHRC network, 'Big Data on the Roman Table'. We will train this service and develop its machine-learning capacity on 100,000s of Roman tableware remains in extensive collections from different social and regional contexts in Roman Britain - London, Colchester and its environs, Vindolanda (on Hadrian's Wall), and Leicestershire. Machine training will move from recording complete/near complete vessels to more fragmentary remains. Used on handheld devices (e.g. mobile phones) by non-specialists and specialists, Arch-I-Scan will automatically recognise and record details of pottery remains and digitally collate and store large quantities of data. Roman tableware remains, often from large-scale production centres (e.g. samian ware from South Gaul), constitute some of the most easily recognisable and extensive bodies of archaeological data with high levels of similarity, in ranges of forms and fabric types, across a wide geographical area. Thus, besides being crucial evidence for Roman food- and drink-consumption practices in different social contexts in Britain, the selected material comprises an excellent body of artefacts to ensure wider application of Arch-I-Scan at other Roman sites, in Britain and beyond. Once Arch-I-Scan is sufficiently trained and has recorded and 'learned' to classify the artefacts from these collections, the resulting datasets will be made freely available for other archaeologists to use as comparanda in their own analyses. This can lead to more comprehensive analyses across Roman archaeology for more socially-oriented questions. Arch-I-Scan can continue to 'learn' from these and other types of pottery as well as other archaeological artefacts. Greater knowledge of how the micro-histories of objects - and the 'human-thing entanglements' of their micro-archaeological contexts - play important roles in our understandings of socio-cultural practice in the context of Roman history can also transform material-cultural approaches to social practice in global history.","With dwindling public funds, government, charitable and professional cultural heritage and archaeological organisations have inadequate resources for detailed, comprehensive classification, and digital collation, management, and analyses of the full artefact datasets in their care. This project sets agendas for more comprehensive, accurate, and cost-effective artefact collation (from past, recent and future excavations) to build more robust, analysable datasets that can be more easily digitally recorded, managed and disseminated for more effective interpretation. It can influence the practices of a range of commercial and government archaeologists, heritage managers, and museum professionals. Enthusiasm for Arch-I-Scan's proof-of-concept experiment from museum professionals and archaeologists working in developer-funded archaeology across the world who participated in the AHRC-funded network, 'Big Data on the Roman Table' (BDRT), and requests by some for involvement in this current project, signify its potential impact among these sectors.  This project has the potential to influence heritage management policies. By facilitating more comprehensive artefact recording and data sharing cultural-heritage organisations will be able to improve on guidelines for effective collation and management of artefactual data. The custodians of artefact collections used as case studies - the Univ. of Leicester Archaeology Service and the partner organisations Museum of London, Museum of London Archaeology, The Vindolanda Trust, the Colchester and Ipswich Museums; - will benefit from Arch-I-Scan's machine-learning expertise in recording Roman tablewares in their collections and from the resulting annotated datasets. The project outputs will also be useful for other professional archaeology and heritage organisations, providing an AI service for efficient, accurate and automated recording of, and comparanda for, Roman ceramics in their collections.  The possibilities Arch-I-Scan provides for greater non-specialist involvement in artefact recording will also be of economic benefit, particularly in developer-funded archaeology, freeing up specialists' time to focus on more comprehensive analyses and interpretation of their respective organisations' datasets, and facilitating the sharing of information among these organisations. Roman pottery specialists are more usually employed in museum and professional archaeology organisations rather than HEI organisations. The project can benefit community groups and members of the public interested in archaeology and museum collections. Museum volunteers, community archaeology groups, and students involved in the recording processes can engage first-hand with digital, state-of-the-art archaeological recording processes and develop skills in this area. More comprehensive analyses of such large datasets of Roman tablewares also means they can be used more effectively, both by HEI and non-HEI archaeologists and museum specialists, for interpreting Roman ways of life and particularly differing eating and drinking practices in the various parts of the Roman world. Such interpretations can enhance museum display, improve visitor experience, and provide better understandings of the role material culture can play in informing on Roman foodways. Government and professional organisations are also responsible for the excavation and management of extensive datasets of other types of pottery, beyond Roman tablewares, and other types of artefacts. Arch-I-Scan can potentially provide a service to record other types and fabrics of pottery (e.g. other Roman wares, Medieval and post-Medieval) to further facilitate more effective, comprehensive and consistent digital collation and management of many of their datasets. The system also opens avenues for the AI technology in other areas where AI's mistakes can be rectified immediately once detected, e.g. health sciences and high-security applications.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT001003%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This 30 month research project seeks to document, map, contextualize and critically analyse the development of the British antiques trade during the 20th century. The project will assess the cultural geography of the trade in antiques in a British context with a consideration of its international dimensions, especially the relationships to the European and North American markets. The project will document the trade in antiques, investigating a series of research questions related to the evolving business practices of the trade and the exchange and circulation of antiques, placing these practices into social, political and economic contexts and mapping these against the evolving cultural landscape of the consumption of antiques. It will result in a number of discrete, but interrelated academic and public-facing outputs, including an edited volume of essays, a conference and workshops, and a web-based interactive (keyword searchable) virtual map of Britain highlighting the locations of dealerships. Using GPS technology, and based on Google Maps, the interactive map will include consistent 'thumbnail' information and data sets, such as trading dates and biographical information for each firm; images of any significant objects that passed through the firm's hands; and links to any objects in public museum collections (in the UK, Europe and the USA). The website will also allow public participation in the research project through user-generated content, keying into the increasing interests of local histories through local heritage societies and family history groups. At the heart of the project will be discrete historical case study research projects into the history of a number of influential British-based dealerships utilizing previously unexplored archival material. An oral history archive based on interviews with retired and semi-retired members of the British trade will be assembled as part of a broader ethnographic study, concentrating on the more recent history of the trade, and in particular the transformation of the antique trade in the last few years of the 20th century.  There has been a significant shift in emphasis in terms of art historical studies in recent years, with an emerging and consistent focus on the mechanisms and practices of the art market, and several major investigations into the history of the art market. But whilst there have been a small number of studies on antiques in terms of the history of collecting, the history of the British antiques trade itself remains a neglected subject. The preliminary mapping of the development of the 19th century antiques trade has already begun to highlight the significance of the development of the trade in the 19th century, but in terms of the 20th century trade there have been only a handful of published journal essays that have directed attention to this subject. Indeed, 'Memoirs of a 20th century dealer', the reflections on the trade in the period c.1940s-c.1980s by the late Roger Warner (2006), and 'Hotspur: Eighty Years of Antique Dealing', a celebration of the firm of Hotspur (2004), remain the only substantive pieces of writing on the subject of the 20th century trade, albeit emanating from the trade itself. This project will therefore direct further attention to the significance of antique dealers as active agents in the markets, highlighting the importance of their socio-economic and cultural practices. It will direct attention to the relationships between the history of the antique trade and the commercial antiques markets and established histories such as the history of 'decorative art', the histories of collecting, and the history of the public museum. It will also provide a new set of data that future studies and investigations can build upon, expanding the possibility of further analysis across a range of disciplines and approaches.","The beneficiaries of the research will be the general public, museums and galleries (in the UK, Europe and the USA) and the commercial sector (antiques and art markets). The research is to be presented through a co-edited publication, an interactive website, a conference, workshops and public talks in museums, as well as filtered through appropriate popular media, and will ensure that the research is disseminated through a range of modes and a rich series of diverse engagements with the research material. The museum and gallery communities will benefit from new research into the history of their collections and new sets of provenance data, offering new opportunities for interpretation. Through the project new links will be formed and existing links enhanced, leading to further potential projects, exhibitions and collaborations and strengthening the bonds between academics and museums in the UK and the USA. The public will benefit from completely new research delivered into the public domain through the project website. This is an important public-interface, with potential for sustainable development and it is envisaged that the project website will extend the life of the research project beyond the 30 month funded period. The intention is to build user-generated content into the website, ensuring a public and collaborative research dimension to the project. The project also keys into the obvious popular appeal of antiques and collecting in wider media, evidenced by the continued success and appetite for antiques-related television programmes (there are over 20 antiques-related television programmes currently on air), as well as popular magazines such as Art & Antiques, Antique Collector and the Miller's Antiques Price Guide series. The public will benefit from enhanced understanding of the history of the antiques trade and its practices and structures. Efforts will be made to ensure that the project website is disseminated beyond academic websites and will be linked through popular media sites such as Antique Collector and Homes and Antiques Magazine.    The project conference will take place at a public venue (Temple Newsam House museum) allowing academics, museum professionals and the wider museum-visiting public, to engage with critical issues in the histories of collecting and the histories of art. There will also be a series of workshops and public talks at museum venues in Leeds and London associated with the research project. The commercial art and antiques sector will benefit from further highlighting the historical significance of the antiques trade, allowing the British art and antiques sector to actively present the significance of its contribution to the histories of collecting and the histories of museums and galleries. This is particularly important in the context of the highly competitive global art and antiques market. The latest economic survey evidence (2010) from the British Art Market Federation (BAMF) on the British art and antiques market indicates that it comprises c.10,000 businesses, providing direct employment for 60,000 people, and indirect employment for a further 66,000 people. In 2010 the art and antiques businesses contributed £911 million in UK tax revenues. The proposed project keys into to some significant anniversaries in the history of the antiques trade; the centenary of the British Antique Dealers' Association (BADA) falls in 2018 and this date may offer potential for future application of the results of the research project. It is envisaged that the research project could have further and sustained impact through a future submission of an AHRC 'Follow on' funding application in 2015. This proposed future funding application would develop the public-facing dimensions of the research by the development and staging of an exhibition on 'The Antique Trade' in a public museum.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK002937%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project transforms the knowledge base established by the AHRC/ESRC funded project ""The Changing Character of Conflict Platform: Understanding, Tracing, and Forecasting Change across Time, Space, and Cultures"" (Conflict Platform) into a vibrant and sustainable Network for Change for local community leaders, practitioners, policymakers, and academics. The Conflict Platform has shed light on the world's quickly changing security landscape, including the dynamic character of cross-border and multi-actor conflicts and their impact on civilians. Its knowledge base includes:  - conceptual framework on conflict changes and an analytical tool (Conflict Platform tool) to capture these changes systematically; - a novel methodology, related theories, and models that present conflicts as multi-actor phenomena and reflect their changes across time and space; - web-based interactive visualisations integrating fieldwork and large data analysis used as a research method to uncover patterns of conflict changes; - photoessays that portray local realities of changing conflict dynamics. The Network for Change maximises the Conflict Platform research's impact, facilitating effective responses to armed conflict. We achieve this via the following activities co-designed with our partners, the Danish Demining Group (DDG), International Alert (IA), and the UN System Staff College (UNSSC): 1. INCEPTION WORKSHOP Co-hosted with UNSSC and with DDG's and IA's participation, this workshop serves to refine the activity design to ensure the best possible engagement and impact of our project. 2. CROSS-STAKEHOLDER FORA We co-host one cross-stakeholder forum in Nairobi (with DDG) and one in Yangon (with IA) to bring together local community leaders, practitioners, policymakers, and academics to discuss quickly changing security landscape in the conflicts in the Horn of Africa and Myanmar and identify successful interventions that anticipate and mitigate the harmful effect of conflict changes. The Conflict Platform findings catalyse the discussion: First, participants learn how to address changes by applying the Conflict Platform tool to specific conflict environments and co-create a Handbook on Change in Armed Conflict. Second, we ground debates in our cross-disciplinary, mixed methods theories and models to challenge silo-thinking and foster lateral thinking. Third, we creatively incorporate local voices into the web-based visualisations to unveil diverse narratives on changes in conflict. Fourth, participants engage with our photoessays to benefit from arts as powerful means of nonverbal expression that is inclusive of marginalised communities.  3. NETWORK FOR CHANGE The forum participants join the Network for Change to maintain communication and knowledge exchange beyond the fora. We set up social media groups for members to discuss their work with conflict-affected communities and find experts for briefings, consultations, or collaboration.  4. FEEDBACK LOOP We foster a communication and knowledge exchange feedback loop by (i) conducting feedback surveys and collecting recommendations for future exchanges from Network members; (ii) hosting a Handbook workshop with Network members at the end of the project to ensure the Handbook reflects the fora debates and Network communication; (iii) co-producing with our partners a Synthesis of Good Practices on mitigating the harmful impact of change in conflict that were shared during the project activities.  By applying an intersectional approach to all our activities, we cater to the needs of the most marginalised parts of conflict-affected people in Myanmar and the Horn of Africa. The stakeholders in Myanmar and the Horn of Africa benefit from the project through increased horizontal modes of networking and a better understanding of how to address conflict changes. Stakeholders worldwide gain proof of concept for effective communication and knowledge exchange systems for other conflicts",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV011375%2F1

The project explored the changing relations between the judiciary, executive and Parliament in light of recent constitutional reforms which established the judiciary as a more separate branch of government. Throughout the project the research team held private seminars with representatives from all three branches of government and the legal profession, to stimulate dialogue between them. They now want to take their findings out to a wider audience, by organising a series of lectures, seminars and conferences to disseminate their findings to different practitioner communities through 2014.  To help engage with new audiences, many of these follow-up activities involve working with partner organisations.  Promoting dialogue with non-lawyers - To take the discussion out to wider groups in politics and civil society, three seminars will be organised with different think tanks: the Centre for Policy Studies (Conservative leaning), CentreForum (Lib Dem) and the Fabian Society (Labour).  Promoting dialogue with the three branches of government - For judges and lawyers, events will be held in the Supreme Court, Middle Temple, Judicial College and the Administrative Law Bar Association. For Parliamentarians, events will be organised with the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Constitution, and the Parliament and Constitution Centre in the Commons Library. For Whitehall, there will be seminars in the Ministry of Justice, Judicial Appointments Commission and Institute for Government.  Closing Conference - These follow up events will conclude with a big public conference in autumn 2014 to round off the programme. It will involve the key participants of the last 10 years (Lord Woolf, Lord Judge, Jack Straw), and address the key questions raised during the public discussions: have the judiciary become too powerful? Are the judges sufficiently accountable? etc. Dissemination in the media  - The research team will promote all these events, and wider discussions through their web pages, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Archival Interviews with former Lord Chancellors and Lord Chief Justices - The researchers have talked to most of the five former Lord Chancellors and three Lord Chief Justices. They now plan to record proper TV quality interviews with each of them to create a historical archive. These would form an important historical record. The Lord Chancellors and Lord Chief Justices have been the leading actors in the recent constitutional changes, but for judicial reasons they have been reticent about their role.","Beneficiaries, and Pathways to Impact The main beneficiaries of these dissemination activities are shown below. The right hand column records the seminars and activities specifically aimed at each of these groups Target audiences: Targeted outlets for each group - Senior judges, and future leaders of the judiciary: Seminars in Supreme Court, Judicial College, Middle Temple - MPs and peers, Parliamentary officials, MPs' researchers: Events with APPG on Constitution; Parliament and Constitution Centre in HC Library; Commons Justice Committee, Lords Constitution Committee - Think tanks, parliamentary and political staff across the political spectrum: Events with Centre for Policy Studies (Con), CentreForum (LD), Fabian Society (Lab) - Senior civil servants: Seminars at Ministry of Justice, Institute for Government, Judicial Appointments Commission - Solicitors, barristers, law students: Lectures to Middle Temple, Admin Law Bar Assn, UK Constitutional Law Blog - Media and wider public: BBC R4 Law in Action, Unreliable Evidence Law websites (eg Law Guardian) and legal press, Legal and political editors and columnists, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, blogosphere  - All the audiences above:Closing conference in autumn 2014 In practice the audiences will not all be so neatly segmented; nor would we want them to be, since we want to promote dialogue between them.

"Funding details                                                                                                              Hearing and reading translated poetry opens audiences to new worlds of experience, gives poets fresh inspiration, and creates international communities of poets and poetry users. It dissolves barriers between cultures - crucial in a world that is ever more globalised, but also marked by misunderstanding between cultures. And producing translated poetry is a modest but important part of the cultural economy. Researching how experts translate poetry gives understanding of how these benefits come about, which can in turn improve practice. Existing research focuses on poetry translating by solo translators, who can read an original 'source-language' poem and convert it directly into a 'target-language' version. Increasingly, however, poetry is also being translated in collaborative workshops - but no systematic research has been done into how these operate. Hence our project aims to find this out by analysing the working processes and outputs of poet-advisor-poet trios (the most representative workshop format). Here, poems are translated by three people working face-to-face: the poet who wrote the source poem, a target-language poet (who does not know the source language), and a language advisor (who knows both languages). We will set up two 4-day expert workshops, where 3 poets from the Netherlands and 3 poets from the UK, helped by 3 language advisors, will work in 3 simultaneous trios to translate each other's poems. Each workshop - one at Poetry International Rotterdam (the Netherlands' biggest poetry festival), and one at Newcastle University - will end with a public reading of poems and draft translations, and talks by participants. All poets are eminent, widely-published poets (most with translating experience), and all language advisors are experienced solo poetry translators. We will video all working discussions and written translation drafts, and hold videoed interviews with participants after each workshop. These video recordings, once securely stored and transcribed, will form our raw research data. We will use them to draw a rich, multidimensional picture of how expert poet-advisor-poet trios work: what poems they choose to translate, the translation challenges they meet and how they solve them, interpersonal relations and talk patterns within working trios, what principles poets and advisors try to follow, and what motivates their work. We will also examine how trios tackle key poetry-translating issues, such as the tension between conveying a source poem's exact content and making the translation into a poem in its own right, and how far translators are willing to make creative changes to source-poem meaning.  Finding this out will increase knowledge of collaborative poetry translation, but also of poetry translation and experts' translation processes in general. We will communicate this to academic audiences via a monograph, academic journal articles and conference papers. The project will also benefit non-academic users: translations from the workshops will bring Dutch and UK poetry to new audiences; and project findings will generate guidelines for good practice, and will inspire and inform future poet-advisor-poet ventures. To enable this, poem translations and project findings will reach poets, translators and poetry audiences via reading events, poetry journals and artwork, websites, social media and professional translation associations.  This interdisciplinary project is led by a translation-studies scholar (Francis Jones, Newcastle University) and two poetry-writing scholars (W.N. Herbert and Fiona Sampson, Newcastle and Roehampton University), all specialised in poetry translating as translators and researchers, helped by two Research Associates. We will work closely with two project partners (Dutch Foundation for Literature and Poetry International Rotterdam), and two university research and public-outreach centres (Newcastle Centre for the Literary Arts and Roehampton Poetry Centre).","Poetry is a significant source of individual well-being, and is often a central element in how people define their culture and heritage; poetry publishing and performance also form an important sector of the cultural economy. Translating poetry extends these benefits across language cultures, and is a crucial pathway to inter-cultural understanding. With our project's poet-advisor-poet workshops, the expertise of those taking part (who are all eminent poets or experienced poetry translators) will almost certainly result in high-quality translations. Hence our project's first aim is to deliver these inter-cultural benefits directly, by bringing our project's poems and their translations to poetry audiences.  Moreover, this inter-cultural dimension lies at our project's heart, since its poet-advisor-poet translating method involves poets from different language cultures working with an inter-language and inter-cultural mediator (the language advisor). This gives the poet-advisor-poet translating method a special potential, which our research findings will define clearly. Hence our project's other aims are to communicate these findings, and guidelines on good practice arising from them, to poets and translators - and, no less importantly, to communicate them to organisations that promote and develop poetry and its translation. This will empower more poet-advisor-poet trios to deliver the benefits of poetry translation to more audiences, giving our project a much wider ultimate effect on poetry-translating and poetry-using communities worldwide. Specific beneficiaries of our project's poems and translations, and of its findings and guidelines, are: [1] Poetry audiences worldwide who know English or Dutch. They will hear and read poems and their translations from the project, delivered via live and web-streamed readings, and via paper and on-line poetry journals. This will enable them to enjoy the benefits of translated poetry mentioned above - and also to experience poetry translated from their own language into another.  [2] Poets who know English or Dutch (including the large community of world poets with English or Dutch as a second language). As part of the poetry audiences just mentioned, they too will hear and read poems and translations from the project. This will expand their cultural horizons by letting them experience new translated poetry, and - in some cases - inspire their own poetic work. They will also hear and read project reports and guidelines about poet-advisor-poet translating, which will accompany translation readings and translation journal features, and which will be posted on websites and via social media; and we will train some poets in poet-advisor-poet translating. This will inspire more poets to undertake poet-advisor-poet ventures themselves. [3] Translators, including existing translators of poetry. Like poets, they will hear and read project reports and guidelines about poet-advisor-poet translating, and some will be trained in poet-advisor-poet translating. Our aim will be to help bring about a paradigm shift, from viewing poetry translation just as a specialist one-person venture (for the few who can translate a source poem directly into a convincing target-language poem), to viewing it also as a team effort where a translator works with poets. This will inspire more translators to join poet-advisor-poet ventures themselves. [4] Organisations which promote poetry and its translation. Project staff will report project findings and guidelines to them, thus influencing the translation projects that they support and encouraging them to sponsor poet-advisor-poet ventures (or more such ventures). These organisations, plus translators' professional bodies, will also publicise project translations, reports and guidelines via their websites, social media and professional journals, ensuring that this project impacts on a worldwide community of poetry-users, poets and translators.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP004628%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Popular music has a high personal value for many people; it touches us emotionally, creates memories and accompanies us in our daily lives. The listener may not be aware of how the songs we enjoy are created; in many cases, it is through the collaborative effort of a number of people involved: performing artists, record producers, engineers, programmers, arrangers. However, the creators of the most fundamental aspect, the song, are not necessarily included in this list: songwriters who compose the songs to be performed, recorded and released. Despite the romantic notion that performing artists write their own songs, the reality is often quite different. Many songs that enter the charts are (co-)written by professional songwriting teams, increasingly in songwriting camps convened and overseen by publishers and record companies. This project researches how collaborative songwriting takes place in songwriting camps. As the first study to focus on the UK and Germany, it investigates what forms of songwriting camps exist in the 21st century to understand the interests of convenors (publishers, record companies, individuals) and participating professionals. It investigates the collaborative creative processes and interplay of the different skill-sets of various roles (topliners, beatmakers, lyricists, producers, performers) and offers insights into the organisation of offline and online camps, legal factors, and the role of songwriting camps within the wider music industries. The investigation will uncover who convenes these events, for what purposes, and what is created and ultimately selected for release. Legal factors such as royalties, shares and splits will be considered as well as the power structures at play. Apart from the organisation of these camps, the research will investigate how the participants' personal, professional and cultural backgrounds influence their aims and actions. This includes an in-depth analysis of the collaborative creative work and the evaluation of the value of collaborative songwriting offline and online. Furthermore, the research will study how the industry uses the results of the camps in the short and medium term. To understand the organisation, purposes, participants, processes and outcomes of songwriting camps, the research employs a combination of methods, in particular qualitative interviews with 30 professionals (songwriters and industry representatives), ethnographic fieldwork in real-life offline and online songwriting camps with field notes and video recordings, and the implementation of a Songwriting Lab documented with a multi-camera setup and audio-recorded interviews. The academic understanding of commercial songwriting as a profession and as a creative and economic activity, as well as its realisation in the wider music industries, is still limited. In particular, there is next to no literature on songwriting camps, and all that exists pre-dates Covid-19. For these reasons, the research is expected to have a profound impact. It develops an empirically derived model of songwriting camps with their various actors, interests and the creative, social and economic contexts in which songs are written. In terms of the songwriters themselves, we expect to make a significant impact on the general understanding of this practice and how participants rationalise their involvement. For those who convene songwriting camps, this research will transform their understanding of the commercial and professional potential of songwriting camps as a model of production. While there is a consensus in academic and journalistic literature about the value of collaborative songwriting, the increasingly important role of songwriting camps is not yet well understood. This research project lays the groundwork by developing a systematic model of songwriting camps in the UK and Germany, filling a significant gap in knowledge and providing a foundation for future research in the young field of songwriting studies.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX002276%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The overarching aim of this project is to explore how community representations produced through creative arts practices (e.g. storytelling, performance, visual art) can be used as forms of evidence to inform health-related policy and service developments. Policies for health improvement tend to focus either on the impact of poverty and deprivation - but with little thought given to historical and cultural context or the experiences of living in these circumstances - or on the prevalence of 'unhealthy behaviours', with limited attempts to connect these with meaningful ways of life. However, research evidence indicates the need for studies that explore the experiences of people living in deprivation and isolation and find ways to improve dialogue between communities themselves and health policy makers. This study will develop methods for using creative art forms as a mode of communication and knowledge exchange. Through analysis of existing representations of disadvantaged and stigmatised communities in literature, film, etc, and the production of new community self-representations in arts-based workshops, it will explore the relationship between 'official' representations of community health and well-being (e.g. in statistical data) and how communities understand and present their own health and well-being. There will be a focus on the accumulated assets and resources that allow individuals and communities to cope with and navigate real and perceived structural barriers, and on the possibilities of resilience to upheaval, resistance to reputational damage, and the alternative representations that these can stimulate. The project will take place across five distinct case-study communities in Wales, Scotland and England and connect these to relevant policy makers, researchers and arts practitioners in each country. Our understanding of community is informed by a 'relational' view of place which conceptualises community as more of a process than an entity. Although we define communities in terms of spaces that are shared, we fully recognise that the meaning of those spaces will not necessarily be shared. The project will consider how perceptions and experiences of community vary across time and changing circumstances, and how communities and the people living in them are represented in relation to key differences and divisions relating to gender, class, ethnicity and age. Following an inventory and analysis of existing representations of each community, both artistic (e.g. in literature) and 'formal' (e.g. in deprivation indices), each case study will use creative engagement methods (including life mapping, drama, storytelling, and photography) to generate new community self-representations, working in partnership with local arts and health organisations. The engagement process will be documented in ways that allow all participants, though diaries, blogs, or digital soap boxes, to reflect on the process and the dynamics of engagement. In all case studies the final creative representations themselves will be co-authored by the community participants and they will have the final decision on how their own accounts are presented. These new 'data' will be presented to relevant local or national policy makers and service development officials through exhibitions, performances, and digital media. The researchers will evaluate this process, reflecting on the relationship between arts participation and community empowerment, and will examine how community values, participation, self-reliance and resilience are shaped, experienced and articulated, and can ultimately become embedded into policy. Through its rigorous analysis, its development of arts-based research methods, and its conviction that literature and the arts form a valid form of 'evidence' in policy discussions, the research will offer innovative thinking about, and will make a distinctive contribution to, the study and development of 'community health and well-being'.","Who will benefit from the research? National and regional partners and end-users in the three represented countries will benefit. These beneficiaries are over and above the Academic Beneficiaries described elsewhere. In Wales, policy makers and service providers in Public Health Wales, Local Health Boards, Communities First (Welsh Government), the Wales Council for Voluntary Action and the Welsh Local Government Association stand to benefit. In Scotland, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at the Scottish Government, Local NHS Boards in Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Highland and Glasgow Life (organisation responsible for culture and sport) are anticipated beneficiaries. In England, Local Clinical Commissioning Groups, NHS Commissioning Board, Birmingham Health and Well-Being Board, local and national Health Watch organisations and Public Health England are identified pathways to knowledge transfer. Through applying the best principles of community engagement and participatory practice, individuals and communities taking part in the research will also benefit. How will they benefit? Individual and communities: All case studies are predicated on the principles of community engagement and participation, as outlined by the Scottish Executive guidelines (2005), to strengthen the likelihood that the experience of participation will be enabling and empowering. Specifically, they aim to provide participants with a voice to express community concerns and mechanisms for influencing decisions and resource allocation within these communities. There is evidence indicating health and well-being benefits of arts participation at both individual and community levels. The cultural impact of communities being able to re-imagine and reclaim stories about their history is a cross-cutting aim. Outputs in the form of artistic production and curating of existing resources will act as a permanent legacy. The research team will identify, in consultation with communities and other partners, suitable geographical and virtual venues for archiving these. Public and Third Sector beneficiaries: The process evaluations of the case studies will enable service commissioners to gain insight into the lived realities of the communities they serve. For example, Communities First in Wales, a national regeneration programme, has an emphasis on community leadership and engagement as a mechanism for change. Health is one of three strategic outcomes. This research will also provide evidence to support the programme in both engaging communities and understanding the impact of interventions on health and well-being. A similar conversation over what counts as evidence is taking place in Scotland. The CMO for Scotland has a core responsibility to reduce health inequalities through cross-sector work on the social determinant of health. The 2010 Annual Report of the CMO (Scotland) highlighted the limits of traditional strategies and measurement of salutogenic processes, the factors which create health for individuals and communities. The outputs from the proposed work will support the CMO's task in identifying appropriate forms of evidence, and also NHS boards in the Greater Glasgow and Highland regions, as they respond to the CMO's lead in mainstreaming assets based approaches. More broadly, the work will provide insight and solid examples of culturally acceptable modes of engagement and participation through the arts in populations who experience barriers to arts participation. This will be of benefit to cultural partners in the three countries and health delivery partners wishing to engage with communities they describe as 'hard to reach'. Reference group Each country will establish reference groups of critical friends from our partner organisations in academia, creative industries, policy and local communities. They will provide conduits of knowledge mobilisation as well as additional expertise in the practice and/or study of cultural representations.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK003372%2F1

At the end of the 18th century rocks, minerals and ores were considered part of the broad domain of natural history. Geology's status as a discrete academic activity remained underdeveloped but became fashionable as a scientific pursuit amongst European elite classes. Geology as an academic discipline emerged as a specialised branch of science by the colonial state, as a distinct scientific and exploitative discipline. The foundations of the discipline, and the institutions that arose during this time, benefitted from and perpetuated resource extraction, knowledge extraction and was an essential tool for Imperial expansion. The historical utilitarian identity of geology over the years remains and reinforces an ongoing bias for the subject. The narrative of geology is one that is still a science for extraction - of mineral resources, of rare fossil specimens, of data and knowledge. This is amply demonstrated in the prioritisation of practice, production, and profit across all its reports. While detailing extraction processes, documenting quality of products, and describing the search for new deposits, and other geological phenomena (e.g. fossils) what remains absent from the discourse is the contribution of nameless and more importantly faceless individuals who were the key interlocutors and explorers in this Imperial enterprise. A look at the documents and reports to promote geological education reinforces this airbrushing of engagement of local or indigenous participants and their knowledge. This form continues even today. The colonial legacy of Earth Science is not known or understood by many practitioners of the discipline today - that we cannot study colonialism without geology, nor geology without colonialism. The influence of this hidden history on university curricula adds to the perception (and reality) of Earth Science as a white, western dominated subject and enhances the hostile environment often cited for the continuing lack of diversity in the discipline. Thus, tackling these two key issues are essential for improving the diversity of those entering and being retained within Earth Science education, research and work.  This project aims to work towards resolving these issues by (1) collaboratively exploring the unrecognised knowledge upon which the foundational institutions of Earth Science is built and how this legacy creates modern day inequity in our discipline and (2) to begin dismantling this inequity by taking a decolonising Earth Science pedagogy and curriculum approach. We partner with the British Geological Survey, the Geological Society of London, the Royal Geographical Society - IBG, and include representatives from Diversity in Geoscience-UK and Black in Geoscience in order to co-create knowledge and resources to drive sector-wide change. Our interdisciplinary team comprises expertise from history, geology, geography, pedagogy and historical geography. We are a team that also is gender diverse and centres two early career researchers from historically excluded groups, who have intersectional identities. The project will train these ECR in new skills and support their career development.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW008726%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              How can people without official political power push the authorities to act? Historically, one of the most common tactics was to create a petition or supplication. Even today, every year hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens sign e-petitions addressed to parliament which can lead directly to high-profile debates in the House of Commons. In seventeenth-century England, petitioning was ubiquitous. It was one of the only acceptable ways to address the authorities when seeking redress, mercy or advancement. As a result, it was a crucial mode of communication between the 'rulers' and the 'ruled'. People at all levels of society - from noblemen to paupers - used petitions to make their voices heard. Some were mere begging letters scrawled on scraps of paper; others were carefully crafted radical demands signed by thousands and sent to the highest powers in the land. Whatever form they took, they provide a vital source for illuminating the concerns of supposedly 'powerless' people and also offer a unique means to map the structures of authority that framed early modern society. This study will be the first to examine petitioning systematically at all levels of English government over the whole century. The project will create a valuable new resource by digitising and transcribing a corpus drawn from nine key collections of petitions held at national and local archives, totalling about 2,500 documents. This corpus, when combined with careful contextualisation, will allow the investigators to offer new answers to crucial questions about the major social and political changes that unfolded in this formative period. We will be able to examine the role of petitioning in specific moments such as the outbreak of civil war in 1642, the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the Exclusion Crisis in 1679-81 and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. We will also be able to track how petitionary practices shaped - and were shaped by - long-term developments, such as the emergence of a politicised 'public sphere' and the vast expansion in the English state, by assessing how much petitioners' attention shifted from local to national authorities, and from individual to mass subscriptions. Such questions are central to understanding government and politics in this period, but they can only be addressed through methodical analysis of a substantial corpus of petitions. This resource will make it possible to go beyond questions specific to petitioning by offering a new perspective on the nature of state authority itself. Current understandings of formal power structures in seventeenth-century England have been drawn primarily from the writings of theorists or officeholders. In contrast, petitions provide a view of authority 'from below'. They will allow us to reconstruct the outlook of people who lacked any official authority of their own. What concerns did they believe should be addressed by their superiors? To whom did they direct their complaints or requests? How did they adapt their rhetoric to fit with the changing political and ideological complexion of the state? The transcribed petitions will be made freely available through a bespoke Institute of Historical Research website, augmented with contextual essays, and searchable by year, locality, sender, recipient, topic and response. So, while publications by the investigators will address the research questions above, other scholars will use this resource to pursuing further lines of inquiry. Moreover, this resource will also serve the needs of stakeholders beyond professional researchers. We will partner with two archives (Cheshire and London Metropolitan) and a large volunteer organisation (The University of the Third Age) to support lay researchers - such as local and family historians - working on this wealth of newly accessible material tagged by place and name. This project will therefore open up a new perspective on the seventeenth century for both scholars and the wider public.","Just as petitions and supplications could be used by almost anyone in the seventeenth century, this project will offer tangible benefits to people with diverse backgrounds and interests. We will disseminate our findings in accessible formats to enhance public understanding of the history of authority, complaint and mobilisation. We will also give non-academics new tools for their own exploration of the past and offer them an expansive collection of previously inaccessible sources. The project will primarily focus on reaching lay researchers, but will also benefit students and archives. The project will stimulate and support engagement with non-academics through a series of formal partnerships with the University of the Third Age (U3A), London Metropolitan Archives (LMA), Cheshire Archives and Local Studies (CALS), the Institute of Historical Research (IHR), and the Raphael Samuel History Centre (RSHC). As detailed in our 'Pathways to Impact', we will reach our target constituencies through collaborative volunteer projects, archive outreach events, accessible online and print publications, and the integration of the new digital resource into a well-established infrastructure of online research. People outside academia are increasingly undertaking historical research of considerable depth and breadth. Many of these are family historians, for whom pre-census resources are very limited. Our project will provide them with easily searchable details about thousands of individuals, including not merely names and locations but also further information about their lives and circumstances as recorded in the texts of the petitions themselves. The innumerable groups dedicated to reconstructing the history of their own local communities will similarly benefit from this new resource by allowing them to go beyond the usual sets of local records to uncover a broader range of stories and perspectives. To engage with these groups, the project will collaborate with volunteers and archives. We will partner with U3A to launch a Shared Learning Project (SLP) through which a team of 15-30 volunteers, advised by the PI and supported by LMA training events, will use the transcribed petitions as a starting point for research on contemporaneous records. The U3A researchers will create brief biographies and local histories - each centred on a specific petition - that will be published on the project website, thus offering valuable context for other users and a fun learning experience for the volunteers. We will also partner with CALS and their affiliated volunteers to run a similar project there, advised by the PDR. This process of engagement and co-production will be strengthened through outreach events hosted by LMA and CALS to showcase the local stories captured in the petitions, and through a public event at the RSHC where we will launch the online resource.   Exploring the role of petitioning in seventeenth-century society - and the petitions themselves - can also contribute significantly to formal historical education, especially at Key Stage 5 (A-Level) and undergraduate level. Many of the existing resources relating to the early modern period continue to present the seventeenth century through a top-down political narrative. Students and their teachers therefore have much to gain from our project, which will enable them to approach British history in this period 'from below'. Archives and repositories - the institutions that provided the raw material for our project - will also benefit. We will supply them with the newly-created metadata to enhance their catalogues at 'item' level. On the project website, we will also highlight the wider range of material they hold so as to promote public awareness and use of their collections. This will be undertaken through the formal partnerships with LMA and CALS as well as informal cooperation with the other six repositories.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS001654%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This innovative project addresses a central issue confronting those who work with musical sources from the early fourteenth to the early seventeenth century, whether as editors, analysts, or performers. The 'mensural' system of rhythmic notation, then prevalent, was highly contextual; unlike modern 'common-practice' notation, in which all notes are divisible only by two (with well-defined exceptions called 'tuplets') and are therefore definite in duration, many notes in mensural notation could be divided either by two or by three without visual distinction, and their durations were subject to further conventional manipulation according to their context. We will construct an online software expert system, modelling the teachings of one of the foremost fifteenth-century music theorists, Johannes Tinctoris (c.1435-1511), that will take files in uninterpreted mensural notation as input and output them in terms of definite durations. Tinctoris's theory lends itself to such treatment by virtue of his rigorous method and intention to instantiate his rules exhaustively. The proposed system is one natural outgrowth of the online critical edition of Tinctoris's writings produced by the same project team (http://earlymusictheory.org/Tinctoris). Results may be output in a variety of formats: original mensural notation or common-practice notation, score or separate parts. Our system will accept the input of uninterpreted mensural notation produced by other projects; our interpreted output will be available to analytical software developed by still others. We will use machine-learning techniques to improve the system's performance. This will involve training with a graded series of pieces of actual fifteenth-century music: (1) all the music examples Tinctoris composed to illustrate his treatises on mensural notation and counterpoint; (2) all Tinctoris's practical compositions, for which we will produce a new critical edition; (3) selected works of two composers Tinctoris regarded highly, Guillaume du Fay and Antoine Busnoys, whose music was composed with somewhat different notational conventions from those articulated by Tinctoris. We expect the system to be able to interpret the notation of nearly all music from between the early fifteenth century and the early seventeenth (the fourteenth century presents variants we should not have time to address). Students of late-medieval and early-modern music nowadays are less well versed than formerly in the complexities of mensural notation, while at the same time more and more musicians are interested in performing such music from facsimiles of the original sources. Accordingly, we will develop a new online interactive learning tool, with which students, performers, or others can practise the cognitive processes involved in interpreting mensural notation. The tool will present progressive exercises together with target results and a mechanism for annotation, and will be able to give feedback on progress and to offer hints. We expect the development of our software system to generate unpredictable historical discoveries concerning the completeness of Tinctoris's theory and its relation to the wider practice of his time. We will communicate these in the form of standard academic publications. An especially valuable aspect of the project will be a series of public workshops in Birmingham, Oxford, and London, forming a progressive introduction to the software learning tool as it evolves. Principal beneficiaries of this project will include all those involved in the performance, editing, and scholarship of late-medieval and early-modern musical repertories. For all users a much heightened and enriched awareness of the implications of the original, complex notations will be raised, and a highly innovative, practical tool made available to assist with the learning process, as well as to enable the production of new user-led editions of works from this pivotal period of western European music.","This project responds to the needs both of scholars in medieval and renaissance musicology and of musicians outside academia who are involved as performers (both singers and instrumentalists), ensemble directors, and editors of repertories from the period. It will produce open-access software and an online self-directed learning tool that will provide a user-friendly resource to help deepen the understanding and interpretation of late-medieval music notation, the detailed study of which has declined markedly in universities and music colleges in recent years. It will offer the means by which both specialists and non-specialists will be able to produce their own editions of works from this important period of music history, for different, user-determined practical or scholarly purposes. In this way, users of all levels of ability will be able to explore medieval music notation in an innovative and imaginative way, and to recognize the profound intellectual and practical differences between it and the modern notation commonly used for most present-day editions and performances. The theoretical principles underpinning the system and the teaching tool are based on the writings of the renowned fifteenth-century musician and theorist Johannes Tinctoris (c.1435-1511). The world-leading expertise of the project team in this area of music (Dr Jeffrey J. Dean, Professor Ronald Woodley, Mr David Lewis, and Dr Christian Goursaud) ensures that both the scholarly and technological aspects of the resource will operate at the highest academic levels, and will provide a progressively structured, distance-learning tool that is of wide-ranging benefit to performers and editors working within the early music world, as well as to students and scholars of music history and theory. An important aspect of the project's external engagement will be a series of public workshops to be held in Birmingham, Oxford, and London, which will function to present our evolving research, to test the developing software, and to obtain valuable feedback from potential user groups as we refine the learning tool into its final release version towards the end of the project. The workshops will be overseen by our postdoctoral Researcher, Christian Goursaud, himself an experienced consort singer, who already manages the Facebook group 'Modern Performance of Mensural Music', which functions as a hub for musicians and ensembles interested in the topic. This important use of social media will provide us with ready access to, and contact with, many potential beneficiaries of the project without geographical restriction. All users of our project website, and of the software tools developed, will be able to make use of the specific editions of music generated by the project team, and to repurpose them to their own requirements, for example through the various permutations of notational and presentational schemata (score, individual parts, original or common-practice notation) that will be made available. In conjunction with digitizations of other original music sources from the late medieval and early renaissance period, which are increasingly widely available online and which can be used as additional test material for our system, the project will encourage musicians and editors from many different backgrounds and of differing abilities to gain a more nuanced historical, technical, and practical understanding of the musical repertories with which they are engaged.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP013910%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Scholars and members of the public rely on records (eg birth/death certificates, census and court records) as the evidence base for research. So too do those making policy or conducting inquiries. All require access to original, authentic records. They do so in the understanding that archivists and records managers have a base of theory and practice that enables the retention of records that are original, authentic, trusted, within context and useable. However, a major issue facing society is the extent to which the digital evidence base is at risk because the concept of the digital record has been challenged. In the digital world the container, i.e. the file, is no longer the record. The record comprises the granular objects that are scattered yet linked, e.g. chains of emails or tweets. Traditional ideas about a record, that it is fixed and unique, are under threat, replaced by uncertainty, mutability and the notion of liquidity. However, records have a 'DNA string', a term coined by Lomas and McLeod to represent the idea that records comprise individual elements, from the body of information and metadata through to software and hardware components, that link globally to create the presentation of a complete object. This DNA can change, degrade or break over time, or it can be maintained via migrations or combined and strengthened through mashups, linked data and blockchain technologies. In the digital world ""the record, not the remix, is the anomaly today. The remix is the very nature of the digital.""1 Concepts commonly accepted as defining a fixed original record are conflicted in the digital world where systems automatically generate multiple copies of documents (e.g. copies of emails held by both sender and recipient) across networks.  Other complex issues surround the interrogation of evidential records. For example in the Hillsborough inquiry it was possible to review typescript statements and determine whether or not there had been alterations. This can be far harder with digital statements where many copies may exist with unclear authorship or the definitive original may disappear into a seemingly infinite cyberspace. If there are no 'original' records in the digital space what does this mean for the future evidence base? In the Hutton Inquiry emails proved critical to the evidence base. In this instance the emails interrogated were still available on the systems and servers in which they had been created. However, had the Inquiry been later and the emails been managed through time then the evidential status of these emails would have been subject to questions surrounding their integrity and authenticity. Since our future evidence base will be digital and multi-media, the reliability, authenticity and usability are crucial if we are to avoid losing our ability to interrogate records through time.  The proposed novel international multidisciplinary research network is led by internationally recognised researchers in records management with The National Archives (TNA), UK government's official archive. The aim is to bring together practitioners, academics and others to explore how the digital has put the traditional concept of the record at risk and work towards a new concept of the digital record; to identify the key issues and challenges of ensuring the future usability of digital records (the evidence base) by all stakeholders through time; to propose a research agenda to address the challenges, and to facilitate effective collaboration to progress digital records research in theory and practice. The network will engage expertise in information, law, digital humanities and computer forensics and a wide range of communities (e.g. the public, historians) to provide perspectives to feed into research and ultimately good practice solutions. Using social media tools, participants from any community will be able to contribute to the network. 1 Keen, A. (2007). The cult of the amateur. Nicholas Brealey. p 23-4.","TNA has recently completed an AHRC funded project 'Big data for law' which looked at how to make the UK's published statute books available digitally. This dealt with published information in a limited number of formats at scale (e.g. PDFs and web pages for Acts of Parliament in standardized formats on one Internet site). It did not deal with the complex range of original evidence. Despite its breadth of expertise TNA recognises that managing the digital evidence base through time remains one of its biggest challenges as well as an international challenge which cannot be solved in isolation. It requires a sustainable multidisciplinary international network to tackle the challenges. Previous attempts to tackle the digital record (notably InterPARES and Pittsburgh) have largely remained object orientated within very specific boundaries of the same theoretical paradigm of the digital recordkeeping, which comprises archives and records management. This network will build on the InterPARES work but will reach out to make the link to theory and practice within other domains and concentrating on concepts of the digital DNA. The network is extremely important to the records, archives and information management professionals globally. These domains need to make stronger, lasting links with a range of disciplines (e.g. computer sciences and law) to remain relevant but also to ensure that their contribution to society is understood and maximized.  There is an assumption that the world of information overload ensures that we will always have information but, in an evidential context, it is important to have exactly the records one requires not just information on a certain subject. There is a whole philosophical and legal debate not only on the needs of evidence but the outcomes of an absence of evidence (see Turvey, 2008 and http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/). If we are to avoid this scenario then it is important to ensure we understand the DNA of records and manage them effectively through time. Data storage decisions are currently being made to push data out into the Cloud. However, the true impact of these decisions is currently hidden. These strategies are stretching the components of the record and the links can and will break through time if the components are not recognised. In addition they shift the legal landscape surrounding the access and ownership of information.  The network will engage with leading records/archives experts internationally, in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada, as they have a history of successful collaboration with the UK, e.g. through the development of international standards and guidelines such as the records management standard ISO 15489). To tackle this 'grand challenge' these same experts will be tasked with connecting to others in designated knowledge domains which will thus snowball the network to experts beyond our discipline boundaries in order to solve key conceptual and practical components of the agenda.   The network will support the creation, retention, sustainability and usability of digital content. Users and stakeholders include governments, policy-makers, decision makers, business, independent researchers and the millions who use records online for family and local history research. Users of future archives are the long term beneficiaries of the implementation of good practices which are shifting and changing through time. The Hillsborough, Bloody Sunday and Goddard Inquiries demonstrate the supreme importance of the survival of usable records. The outcome of the network, based on the conceptualisation of a record's DNA, will facilitate the usability of the digital record for future researchers, public inquiries etc.  Turvey, B. (2008).

This project drew on documentary, visual and oral history sources to provide an authoritative treatment of a subject that had largely escaped academic scrutiny. Historical pageants were one of the most important and ubiquitous channels of popular engagement with the past in twentieth-century Britain: communities of all sizes came together to stage theatrical re-enactments of local and national history, often involving thousands of performers and tens of thousands of spectators. The original RoP project considered the social organisation, dramatic content and wider cultural significance of historical pageants, using locally held sources across the country to examine how communities and institutions told their own histories. The central output was a free-to-use, fully searchable online database that now contains details of more than 650 pageants (www.historicalpageants.ac.uk/pageants/). In collaboration with project partners in Bury St Edmunds, Carlisle, St Albans and Scarborough, the RoP team also produced a series of successful exhibitions, workshops and other events, stimulating public engagement with the research. Involving one existing and four new project partners, as well as other collaborating organisations, the follow-on activity will extend and deepen the non-academic impact of the research. It will do this by deploying techniques of public engagement that were not exploited in the original RoP project, including dramatic and musical re-performance and the use of film. It will also result in the first national-level exhibition on historical pageantry. The key elements of the follow-on project are: 1. A 30-minute documentary film, produced in partnership with the Windrose Rural Media Trust, telling the history of pageantry across Britain and including re-performed pageant scenes and music, as well as existing footage; 2. A programme of activities at Eversley, Hampshire, and St Albans, Hertfordshire, co-organised with project partners and engaging both adults and children in re-performances and other activities connected with pageantry, alongside new exhibitions focusing on those localities; 3. A local history fair at Cecil Sharp House, London, organised in partnership with the English Folk Dance and Song Society. This will bring together local historians and heritage sector organisations, many of whom have an active interest in undertaking research into, and staging exhibitions about, historical pageantry. It will also include an element of re-performance, and will take place alongside an exhibition in the same location, focusing on the links between historical pageantry and the folk arts; 4. The production of a 30-page Guide to the study of pageants, aimed at local history and heritage communities and available online and in hard copy; 5. A series of activities at Axbridge, Somerset, in partnership with Axbridge Pageant Association, during its preparations for the 2020 Axbridge Pageant; 6. A 'roadshow' of events in three locations - Glasgow, York and Dorset - at which members of the project team will share the results of their research, including the film and Guide, with project partners and other collaborators, and help to build further capacity for local history research into the pageant tradition. Through these activities, the follow-on project will extend the reach of the RoP project, while also promoting independent and collaborative research at a local level into an important and stimulating aspect of modern British community history.","This follow-on project will promote knowledge and understanding of historical pageants among new user groups and the broader national public, while also deepening engagement with the heritage sector and local history communities. It will do this by means of media and methods not used in the original project, including performance, film, training for independent/local historians and a national-level exhibition. We will use innovative techniques of public engagement, including dramatic and musical re-performance, and also film, to extend awareness of the history of the pageants. We will work with theatre groups and with those directly connected with the ongoing pageant tradition, as well as following up previously unanticipated opportunities to stage exhibitions in connection with this work.    To achieve our project objectives we will work with one existing and four new project partners. In Eversley, Hampshire, a partnership with the Charles Kingsley Society will result in a public lecture and study day, using objects and documents in the possession of the project team, and a re-performance of the 1919 Eversley pageant by pupils from Charles Kingsley's School. In St Albans, Hertfordshire, we will extend our existing partnership with St Albans Museums in new directions, working with local theatre groups to re-stage scenes from the 1907, 1948 and 1953 St Albans pageants; we will also co-curate a large exhibition in the new St Albans city museum (opened 2018), which offers a previously unanticipated opportunity to present the history of local pageants to a large audience. In Axbridge, Somerset, we will partner with the Axbridge Pageant Association (APA) to deliver a programme of activities linked to the upcoming 2020 Axbridge historical pageant.  We will also work with a new, national-level project partner, the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS), based at Cecil Sharp House (CSH) in London. An exhibition will be staged at CSH, focusing on the folk arts elements of pageantry: our database at www.historicalpageants.ac.uk/pageants contains much detail about these aspects of the phenomenon, hitherto not fully exploited. Working with EFDSS, we will host a local history fair aimed at local history communities and the heritage sector. This will offer an opportunity for local historians to share their own research into pageant history, and will build further capacity through object-handling and research training sessions.  Finally, we will work with another project partner, the Windrose Rural Media Trust (WRMT), to produce a 30-minute documentary film about the history of the pageant movement. This will use oral history collected during the original project, archive film of pageants, and newly filmed re-performances of pageant scenes and music, and it will form the basis of a pitch to the BBC for a television documentary or series about historical pageants. It will be made freely available via the project website. Across all our partnerships, a key impact of the follow-on work will be the stimulation and support of independent research into historical pageants. Feedback collected from the original project shows a considerable appetite in the heritage sector and among local history communities for this work, and we will offer practical support for local historians and heritage organisations who want to undertake it and/or engagement activities of their own (e.g. exhibitions). This support will include a printed and online Guide to studying pageants, and a 'roadshow' of activities in the form of events in strategically located parts of the country: Dorset and Somerset (involving the APA and WRMT), York (working with the Scarborough Archaeological and Historical Society) and Glasgow (in collaboration with Glasgow Women's Library).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS011382%2F1

Cultural mega-events like the European Capital of Culture (ECoC) and the UK City of Culture (UKCoC) can be effective as catalysts and accelerators for culture-led urban regeneration strategies, through a focused and intensive programme of cultural activities. There are many evaluation studies about the impacts of City of Culture programmes, but they do not explore their medium and long-term effects on a shared UK-wide basis. Furthermore, they are not systematically used for policy development, which is a central issue that this project aims to explore. The proposed research network creates an interdisciplinary space where academics, postgraduate researchers and local, national and international policy makers can pursue a better collective understanding of the Cities of Culture initiative, whilst specifically exploring the conditions and procedures required to create productive links between evaluation and new policy development. The network includes all (European) Capitals, (UK) Cities and (London) Boroughs of Culture projects delivered by cities within the UK. The network will also connect UK researchers with their European counterparts in Aarhus (Denmark) and Galway (Ireland), allowing the network to benefit from insights into culture-led regeneration practices elsewhere in Europe. Network membership will consist of a core group of researchers, evaluation professionals and national and international policy representatives, along with an associate group consisting of academics, local policy makers and other interested bodies. The project will also establish a forum for postgraduate scholars researching the Cities of Culture initiative within partner universities and beyond.  The network programme consists of three events. The first is a colloquium, bringing together all network groups to identify challenges, barriers and opportunities for turning collective Cities of Culture research evidence into policy. The second is a two-day specialist workshop where the core group will examine issues raised in greater depth. In the final colloquium, attended by all groups, the outcomes of all events will be examined, leading to the production of key recommendations for effective knowledge exchange between City of Culture researchers and policy makers in the future. The project will result in a website, three summary reports and one key recommendations document. Outcomes will be disseminated via the website and through the professional and academic networks of project members. The outcomes of the network will also be published in a professional magazine, such as Local Government Association First and as an academic paper in a leading cultural policy journal such as the International Journal of Cultural Policy or Cultural Trends.","Who will benefit from the research network? The network will contribute to academic research on the Cities of Culture initiative and its social, economic, spatial and cultural impacts. It will influence the ongoing research of network members by offering new perspectives and longitudinal insights, gained via discussion and activities at network events. The postgraduate forum will ensure that early career researchers also benefit from the interactions and findings. In parallel, the key objective of the project is to utilise collective research to influence the development of cultural policy, specifically that relating to future City of Culture projects. To this end, the network ensures participation of UK national organisations with an arts and cultural policy remit, along with representatives from local authorities who have delivered (or will deliver) a City of Culture programme and other interested bodies. These partners will all gain from the insights and recommendations resulting from the network. The participation of academic and policy partners from Aarhus (Denmark) and Galway (Ireland) will ensure that UK members also benefit from wider European perspectives and that our European partners will have the opportunity to learn from UK experience. Beyond the network, the dissemination of outcomes via the academic and professional networks of members will ensure the findings and recommendations can be utilised by the wider cultural policy and research community.  Network participants will benefit from: Hearing presentations from a range of high profile academic researchers and other experts in the interdisciplinary field of City of Culture research and policy. Interaction between established academics, early career researchers and policy professionals. The production of new collective and longitudinal insights  The creation of conditions to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and insights between the producers (academics) and users (policy makers) of research. Recommendations regarding effective procedures for turning City of Culture evaluation and research into future policy. The opportunity to draw upon network contacts and findings to develop future research proposals and funding bids  The opportunity to build a strong relationship with the forthcoming AHRC Centre for Cultural Value and to establish the network as a specialist sub-group affiliated to the Centre. The wider research and policy making community will benefit from access to the insights and recommendations produced by the network, disseminated via the project website and including summary reports and recommendation documents. The community will also benefit from the publication of the outcomes in a professional magazine, such as the Local Government Association First and in a leading academic cultural journal such as the International Journal of Cultural Policy or Cultural Trends.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS012214%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The projection of national identities and interests on the global stage is being radically reconfigured by the twin consequences of post-Cold War geopolitical dynamics and transformations in the global news media landscape. The arrival of new players like Russia Today (RT) is altering the international media ecology. RT is Russia's primary international broadcaster with a reputation for being a mouthpiece of Putin's regime but the reality is more complex. The mediatization of political conflicts, or the myriad ways in which media like RT not only represent but also intervene and shape conflicts, have significant consequences for peace and security. The proposed research is the first in-depth, comprehensive study of the role of RT in projecting Russia for international audiences. It will be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of specialists in Russian culture, history, politics as well as experts in media, security and computational linguistics.  The contemporary Russian security-media nexus bears a complex relationship to the history of the Cold War and to Russia's imperial past but it is poorly researched. Contemporary work on RT has hitherto lacked detailed empirical analysis tied to a robust theoretical framework. It has failed to account for the complexities of current relationships between RT and its very diverse audiences. Understanding the significance of RT in the evolving East-West 'information war' is both urgent and necessary to improving international understanding, informed citizenship and finding diplomatic solutions to seemingly intractable conflicts.  This project illuminates the processes by which RT not only reconfigures publics and audiences, but also furnishes the very conditions for unprecedented modes of international mistrust, conflict and insecurity. In integrating historical, discourse analyses, audience and social media research in an innovative methodological framework, we test hypotheses drawn from our pilot research that challenge conventional thinking and presumptions about RT and really get to grips with RT's recalibration of Russia's public image for international audiences and its blurring of distinctions between public diplomacy and propaganda. We address the following core themes and questions:  1) Narration: how do RT's narratives of Russian nationhood, and its narrational strategies echo and transform those of the Soviet/imperial past? 2) Legitimation: how are state agendas legitimated?  3) Adaptation: how are domestic news narratives adapted for RT's international audiences? 4) Identities: how are 'grammars of identity' and othering represented in RT's outputs and with what implications for exacerbating an 'information war' and amplifying securitisation processes? 5) Engagement: how do audiences and users engage with RT's broadcast news and social media content? We research the above processes through case studies of three kinds of 'media events': (1) pre-planned Russian media-state collaborations; (2) on-going political conflicts; (3) unexpected, disruptive security-related events. Outputs include a co-authored monograph and reports for research users (Conference of International Broadcasting Audience Researchers (CIBAR), the US Broadcasting Board of Governors, the BBC World Service, CCNI, Al-Jazeera, France Medias Monde, Deutsche Welle, the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Chatham House and BBC Monitoring).  We will bring journalists, policy makers and academics into dialogue via a major conference and workshops, demonstrating the significance of Arts and Humanities research for studying the relationship between media, identity and international security.","There are two main groups of beneficiaries with whom we already have excellent contacts developed within the framework of earlier projects. First are international broadcasters (IBs), particularly the BBC WS, Deutsche Welle, CNN International, France Medias Monde and Al-Jazeera. Further related beneficiaries are the US Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), whose remit is to oversee the US's government-funded IBs, and the Conference of International Broadcasters' Audience Research Services (CIBAR), which facilitates the appropriate use of audience data in IB decision making. We will produce preliminary and final user reports for the IBs, BBG and CIBAR, offering them important insights into RT's editorial policies, deployment of social media platforms, other audience engagement strategies and modes of operation. The final report will be presented and discussed at a workshop. We will also give a presentation at CIBAR's annual convention.  The second group of beneficiaries are UK policy makers and policy analysts. In particular, we are targeting Chatham House, the Russian and East European Desk of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and BBC Monitoring (BBC M). The on-going crisis in Ukraine and Russia's controversial actions in the Middle East underscore the increasing need for such bodies to develop a multi-faceted picture of the full complexity of Russia's motivations for its actions on the international stage, acknowledging not just their similarity to, but their profound difference from, earlier Soviet models of behaviour. We will disseminate a user report to, and give presentations at Chatham House, the FCO, and BBC M on Russia's uses of international broadcasting as a public diplomacy tool and the implications for international security of RT's audience mobilisation strategies. We will organise a workshop with Chatham House and BBC M on the ability of (semi-)authoritarian states to combine broadcasting, digital and social media resources to capture and maintain new audiences. Our long-standing relationship with BBC M will facilitate dissemination of our findings to the security community. Professor O'Loughlin, a member of our project Advisory Board, will draw our research to the attention of UK foreign policy makers through his advisory role on the House of Lords Select Committee on soft power. Representatives of all of the above organisations will be invited to take part in a conference we will organise on international media and global conflicts. This will initiate a dialogue between academics, international broadcasters and policy makers and analysts. We will work closely with our Universities' Press Offices to bring our project to the attention of key media outlets in the UK. We plan one public lecture and/or radio broadcast a year to reach a wider audience and will run a project blog and social media publicity campaign. We will also use Manchester's leadership of one of the AHRC's new 'Open World' Research consortia to ensure that relevant research user and postgraduate communities will benefit from our project findings and outputs.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP00508X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Richard Demarco is one of the most relevant and influential figures in the world of visual arts and theatre in Scotland, and Europe since the 60s. Since the beginning of his career, through the foundation of the Traverse Theatre (1963), the Richard Demarco Gallery (1966-1998), and later with the Demarco European Art Foundation, his involvement in the Edinburgh Festival and Fringe Festival, Demarco has been a key player in promoting the European Avant-garde in Scotland and fostering cultural exchanges in Europe. Most relevant collaborations include Beuys, Abramovic, Neagu and Kantor. Although some studies have been conducted regarding the relationships between Demarco and the European Avant-garde (see for example E. McArthur & A. Watson 2010) the Italian connection has not yet been uncovered, and seminal productions, exhibitions and exchanges with Italian partners have not been researched and re-assessed in a wider context.  This partial investigation of Demarco's activity is possibly due to the sheer volume of events of differing nature that he has organised, promoted and participated in over the years, including exhibitions, performances, plays, conferences, travels, workshops Furthermore Demarco's archives are composed of an imposing amount of documents, photographs, books, artworks and ephemera. Demarco has produced and shown work from some of the most relevant Italian or Italian based artists of the 20th century: Alberto Burri, Baj, Chiari, Pascali, Paolini, Kounellis, Scialoja, Mimmo Rotella, Merz, Plessi, Sartorelli, Mulas, Quartucci and Tato'. Collaborations and exchanges include Italian cultural key figures such as Palma Bucarelli, the Count Panza di Biumo, Maria Gloria Conti Bicocchi, Achille Bonito Oliva. Part of the photographic archive has been digitised and became available online with the Demarco Digital Archive thanks to a project conducted at University of Dundee by Watson/MacArthur/Shemilt initially funded by the AHRB/AHRC (2002-2008), with a Resource Enhancement Award 'The Demarco Archives: Accessing a 40-Year Dialogue between Richard Demarco and the European Avant-Garde'. The previous involvement in the Team of the PI (Shemilt) and the Archivist (Lockhart) who collaborated in several projects related to Demarco would be a key facilitating element in the new proposal.  Richard Demarco: the Italian Connection will capitalise on the recovered Demarco Digital Archive (around 10,000 records) and will give the opportunity to uncover the fundamental exchanges between Scotland and Italy through Richard Demarco in the European context. The project will make available for the first time through translations, seminal historical Italian materials to the larger audience of English speakers. This project aims to retrace the key exhibitions, theatre productions, events, programs and exchanges between Scotland and Italy organised by Demarco and assess their impact on the cultural community in both countries and provide useful sources for art and theatre historians, scholars, critics, curators, researchers and practitioners based in universities, archives, museums and cultural institutions internationally. Research will be undertaken by: 1) Archival and bibliographical research 2) accessing the extensive records of the Demarco European Art Foundation collection  3) Interviews with Demarco and the surviving artists, curators, performers, directors and animateurs involved 4) Analysis & Reassessment of events, performances and artworks 5) Rediscovery and occasional recovery of video and film artworks and documentation  6) Workshops and screening with artists 7) Drafting of a Chronology of exchanges between Italy and Demarco in the European context. The research findings will be published in an edited, peer-reviewed book with an international call for papers to stimulate contributions from different methodologies and perspectives including Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Curatorial and Media Studies.","The results of the research on Demarco's Italian connection will fill a fundamental gap in the history of the practice and will provide a unique, fundamental and useful resource to individuals and organizations that promote, produce and exhibit the Avant-garde and cultural exchanges in Europe including contemporary art museum, archives, foundations, theatres, media centres, media theoreticians, galleries, art history and performing arts scholars, critics, and arts broadcasting and television production companies The collaborations with subject protagonists and world class specialists will enable to create a subject-specialist base from which to develop an evolved range of future research and implementation projects involving exhibitions, screenings, publications (books), performances, workshops and online recourses such as an online database.  The Research Team will be in regular and direct contact with key centres of contemporary art and experimental theatre in Europe (particularly Italy and the UK). This will enable knowledge exchange and the opportunity to exchange materials, methods and opinions and to develop a debate on the research findings. Centres include the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, LUX, London; Heure Exquise, France; Lima, Amsterdam; BnF, Paris; BFI, London; Electronic Arts Intermix, New York; ASAC, Venice; Scottish Screen Archives, Glasgow inter alia. Visits, meetings and research travels by the research team with partner universities, institutions, broadcasters, archives and museums will contribute to consolidate and further extend the network of contacts and the project's impact. A main impact of this project will be on European culture, by way of filling a gap in knowledge and providing seminal references for contemporary practitioners, scholars, broadcasters and curators. Demarco was and remains, a genuine European who has been an exemplar in promoting a European spirit and the importance of culture within this. The Website will include ephemera, articles, interviews, catalogue of works and artists and be hosted on the main Demarco online archive website. The publication will constitute a reference resource on cultural exchanges between Italy and Scotland from the 60s to today. Our previous project websites are based around a scholarly database-led approach and more socially orientated pages on Facebook. Both have proved very successful and popular with their targeted audiences. We intend to continue with this approach with Demarco. A programme, Demarco: The Italian Connection will be organized to take place at Summerhall, Dundee Contemporary Arts - with whom we have close partnerships - and University of Dundee: this will disseminate the results of the research and bring the research and the subject under the international spotlight. Furthermore it will help consolidate the network of contacts and will encourage exchanges on the topic. The project will promote a new agency of the importance of cultural exchanges within the visual arts/ theatre, and encourage citizens to look positively to multi-cultural society and the cultural integration. Ultimately it will stimulate practitioners and professionals to start international cooperations and collaborations. Events with artists and performers will be organised for universities' students and for general public, including Sapienza University of Rome.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR005206%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project is situated in the interrelated academic fields of Disability Studies and History, Disability Culture and Disability Art. The Principal Investigators (PI's) are Professor Dr McKeown (UK) and Professor Dr Musenberg (DE). Musenberg's research is situated at the intersection of History of the Discipline of Special Education, Cultural Disability Studies and inclusiveness in Historical Education. McKeown's research is situated in the fields of Art and Design, Disability Art and Disability History and Heritage.  Disability Studies (and in the UK Disability Art) emerged from the emancipatory Disabled People's Movements of the 1970's and 1980's and was established in academia in the context of the social sciences. Cultural perspectives brought additional points of contact with e.g. Literary studies, Cultural History and Disability Culture and the Arts. For the purposes of this project we have aggregated and described our interests as reflected by Cultural Disability Studies.  The project will view, analyse and disseminate a seminal body of disability and impairment related artworks collected and curated by the German disability pedagogue Hans Würtz (1875-1958) between 1910-1933 - a critical period in European history that saw the rise of National Socialism and its extreme attendant ableist and disableist thought and action. Würtz innovatively moved away from the prevailing medical perspective on impairments to a more cultural perspective that materialised in his outstanding collection both in regard to its size and content. The Collection, paradoxically, survived because the National Socialist authorities saw no value in it and allowed Würtz to remove the Collection to his place of exile in Czechoslovakia. Therefore the Collection survived in two Prague based archives.  The largely unmapped collection comprises 180 pottery, ivory and wood statuettes; 3500 images in the form of drawings, cartoons, lithographs, engravings, reproductions from magazines and photographs; 20 paintings; Glass plate negatives which document elements of the collection. One of the main research question is, how impairment and disability is represented (and staged) in the Collection; across the whole assemblage and through the closer investigation of a selection of key items? Following this question our key objectives are - to make the Collection accessible for our research (capture the Collection in a digital form) and to view and organise the Collection in regard to its themes and topics, - to analyse a sample of images and sculptures regarding the staging and production of disability within the artworks - to combine art historical contextualisation and iconology of the Collection with an reconstructive, qualitative approach of image interpretation (documentary method) - to contribute to Cultural Disability Studies knowledge by reflecting on the historic culturally 'fabrication' of the body and to contribute to the development of museology in relation to Disability Arts in the UK and in Germany. The project's outcome will be two scientific colloquia and two exhibitions in Berlin and Middlesbrough featuring key signature images including 2D artworks and 3D virtual statuettes in Berlin and Middlesbrough, a transdisciplinary anthology and research papers submitted by the two project PostDocs.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW010712%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The overall aim of this project is to enhance the legacy of the Connected Communities (CC) programme through exploring the translation of university-led research into governmental policy processes. We aim to challenge and expand dominant understandings of research by drawing on insights and methods from the humanities and interpretive social science. Contemporary social problems are widely perceived as increasing in scope and complexity, and needing to be better understood if appropriate policy responses are to be developed. However, there is a longstanding problem that the relevance of academic research in understanding this complexity is not always obvious to potential 'research users' in government.  The heart of the proposed research is to observe the use and translation of research outputs generated by CC projects as they move into central government and local government policy processes. This process involves the interaction of academic researchers, research analysts and policy teams in Whitehall and local practitioners who implement policy initiatives. We will pose three research questions: 1: how are different kinds of CC research 'outputs' taken into policy arenas?  2: what modes of communication and types of knowledge are explicitly preferred and habitually adopted in different domains (academic, government research analyst etc.) and why? 3: what assumptions about the value of different kinds of findings and modes of communication characterise the domains, and how susceptible to change are these?  The research will focus on following outputs from the CC Policy Reviews for DCLG. This will allow comparison of a wide range of different kinds of communication whose uptake and translation will be taking place during 2014/2015 and so can be followed 'in real time'. Drawing on the research team's wider experience, and the review of CC projects carried out for the Reviews, other CC outputs will be introduced into the 'conversations' between academics and researchers as and when appropriate. This detailed, interpretive work will be put into a broader context through a survey of all CC projects to identify the extent and nature of policy engagement across the programme.  The research will be co-produced by a team of academics and the research analysts of DCLG's Decentralisation and Big Society (DABS) division. Its execution will involve close engagement with the Division's policy team and local government officers in the pilots of the 'OurPlace!' neighbourhood budgeting programme (i.e. key 'users' of the Policy Reviews).  We will: a) Survey CC policy engagement: on-line survey of all CC projects, followed up by five interviews. b) Observation: non-participant observation of DABS meetings averaging two per month over the 12 month fieldwork period (and/or others as opportunity arises) plus 4 periods, of one week, embedded participant observation fieldwork within DABS; obesravtion and interviewing in 3 OurPlace! authorities. c) Semi-structured interviews: with Policy Review academics, DABS and OurPlace! officials.  d) Initiation workshop: with wider group of expert academics and policy makers and practitioners. e) Workshops: three workshops in which the assumptions affecting and processes of translation across team borders will be explicitly examined by all participants. f) Reflective writing: Our collective, continuous analysis of translation processes will be summarised and tested by monthly one-page reflections across the research team and research partners. The outputs will be: a) a survey of the CC programme's engagement with policy making  b) guidance for academic researchers (especially those working from arts and humanities perspectives) on co-production and increasing impact with policy-makers c) guidance for government officials on using arts and humanities research  d) academic articles in selected journals.","Recognising the gap between intentions and practice in delivering impact in policy-making, this research aims to contribute to a better understanding of impact itself. As research councils increasingly make impact a key criterion of grant funding, it is important to recognise that the value and relevance of academic research is not always obvious for those commissioning and using research within government. The research contributes to the goal of increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy, through improving how the academic sector works with government, how researchers use and communicate evidence in government and how policy officials articulate their policy questions to the academic sector. We aim to co-produce knowledge about the use of knowledge, producing new understandings amongst academics and government officers based in the examination of processes of interpretation, translation and interaction.  Direct (excluding academic) beneficiaries of the project will be: - Research analysts in DCLG - Policy teams in DCLG - AHRC - OurPlace! practitioners in local government  Indirect beneficiaries include: - Research analysts and policy teams in other central government departments  - Academics engaged in arts and humanities research with central government - Devolved administrations and local government  - Social science researchers and research funders - Wider policy community using government-sponsored research or engaging with governments who themselves are guided by that research; including think tanks, campaigning organisations and professional bodies.  - The wider public, as the ultimate beneficiaries of improvements in policy effectiveness and efficiency.  How will they benefit?  Research analysts will be able to use the findings to inform research commissioning and better understand effective use of academic research with internal policy-makers and external audiences. Policy teams across central government will be able to collaborate better with research analysts as commissioners and ensure academic research better meets their needs. The AHRC can make use of the findings to better understand the process through which arts and humanities research findings are translated and used by policy and practitioner communities. This will be helpful in guiding future research calls and in producing guidelines for impact. The broader insights around translation and negotiation will be relevant for other research councils. Devolved administrations and local government will be able to apply the findings to their own commissioning and consumption of research. The wider policy community using government-sponsored research will benefit from the multifaceted account of research translation that the project offers. Timescales We will have an impact during the life of the project, through our workshops and action learning activities. The launch and dissemination of the findings will be key impact points, particularly by raising awareness of the project with those who were not directly involved. We expect to have long-term and broader impact through dissemination in government social research channels and through CC and other academic networks. Staff will deepen their research and professional skills through the project, developing both a more reflective research practice and their understanding of how to undertake and negotiate policy-relevant research. The project will also consolidate professional skills such as event planning, networking, report-writing and dissemination of findings.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013223%2F1

It will do this by consolidating and expanding partnerships for knowledge exchange with a range of partners in the UK and in the Middle East, particularly through a range of institutional and student-led internships, and by continuing to support innovative research networks capable of generating groundbreaking research and achieving wide dissemination. Finally, it will consolidate an MSc in Advanced Arabic at the University of Edinburgh and develop a Persian language and cultural immersion programme at Manchester University that will represent key resources for advanced language and culture training. CASAW works closely with the other UK LBAS centres to sustain a vigorous programme of area studies training and dissemination events across the UK.","CASAW Phase II comprises a comprehensive programme of research networks, internships and language training networks, all developed with non-academic users as core beneficiaries. CASAW's planned collaborative activities and ongoing relationship with other LBAS centres also generate impact through, among other things, the sharing of best practice and engagement with a broader range of stakeholders. For the language training programme, beneficiaries will include UK, EU and international students and their future employers who need graduates with advanced Arabic, and now Persian, language skills and culture-sensitive presentational skills as well as in-depth knowledge of the Middle East/North Africa, its history, culture and present (and shifting) socio-political configurations. The training network's research focus on new methods of teaching Arabic, including teacher training and application of EIL methodologies tested through research to Arabic teaching, will benefit Arabic teachers and students world wide through the dissemination of text books and eLearning material as well as the annual Arabic teaching summer school in Edinburgh. The internships will all be developed in close collaboration with the host organisations in the public or private sector in the UK and the Middle East and will feed directly into each organisation's business objectives and dissemination plans. Translation internships, for example--as we know from current placements with Arabia Books and Saqi Books--will benefit the publishers' capacity for translation and dissemination of Arabic imaginative writing. Whilst benefiting the individual organisations and theirstakeholders/audiences, the internships will also develop interns' experiences and skills, for their own benefit and that of future employers. Similarly, internships attached to research networks will provide students with networking, organisational and research management skills that will generate wide-ranging impact not only during their placements but throughout their future careers. All proposed research networks are centred around topical and urgent themes which will engage policy makers, journalists and other professionals working in the region to improve understandings of the Arab region amongst key stakeholders as well as the wider public. Topics vary from analysing the contemporary Arab world, from cultural, religious and historical perspectives, to more historical concerns dealing with the 19th and 20th centuries, World War One, medieval Islam and early Islam. But in all cases their contemporary relevance is clear and the historical and contextual depth such projects bring will strengthen the relationship between knowledge production, policy-making and practice in understanding the political situation in the Arab world. A diverse range of research networks, further, will pursue creative and innovative strategies for dissemination. In addition to holding academic workshops, conferences and lecture series, networks will hold seminars for policy makers (e.g. FCO), conduct networking events, and organise collaborative events with partners in and outside of academia, in the UK and abroad. Outputs will range from scholarly articles, edited collections and monographs, to museum and online exhibitions and multi-media websites.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL006774%2F1

By early in the twentieth century, some portion of the bible had been translated into approximately 1000 languages, including many with no previous written form. This astonishing achievement was the cultural equivalent of the moon landing, or the mapping of the human genome, and continues to the present day. As a result of decades of arduous labour, much of what is known about global majority languages relies on the work of Indigenous translators and missionary linguists from the colonial era. Yet much of this critical knowledge remains obscured in religious archives. GloBil will unlock the archives of German and British bible societies, uncovering the history of the global bible movement and its discovery of global languages. To provide focus and direction, GloBil will explore bible translation in three geographically diverse regions, namely the Arctic, Oceania and Australia, and West Africa. These regions are significant because they illustrate the different frontiers into which British and German colonisers were moving and the range of encounters with unique and distinctive languages and peoples. GloBil seeks to delineate the global bible movement in these three regions, uncovering the contribution of Indigenous translators and evangelists, and the significant contribution of British and German bible societies. Bible societies were key to the dissemination of British and German soft power, both at home and abroad, though their significance and global importance has, until now, received little recognition. In the UK, the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) was a cultural power house which funded the dissemination, publication and distribution of bibles to the peoples of the world. The BFBS worked in partnership with other bible societies and a host of missionary societies in the field, who together sought to give written form to the languages of the world, beginning with those in contact zones at the leading edge of colonial expansion. At every point, it was supported by German societies, with funds, linguistic expertise and missionaries and personnel who shared a common evangelical and pietistic world view. While the missionary movement and the contribution of German missionaries to British missionary societies is relatively well understood, GloBil will uncover the significance of Anglo-German collaboration to funding, publishing and disseminating global bible knowledge. Research has been divided into six work packages, each with a dedicated team with the linguistic and research skills required to access bible society and missionary records in Germany and the UK. Work packages includes both global majority and European-based scholars and artists who will collaborate in tackling the research questions.  The project is committed to foregrounding the repatriation of colonial knowledge of Indigenous languages. It will achieve this through innovative presentation of research results, collaboration with Indigenous scholars and artists and contemporary heirs to colonial bible language communities. By creating a wide range of outputs in different media, it will engage and reach beyond the academic community. These outputs include: 1. The GloBil database, which will include the map of the Global Bible movement, 2. the GloBil conference, with contributions from Africa, Oceania, the UK and Germany including artists and academics and 3. the GloBil exhibition, which will be hosted by the Bible Museum Münster, who will produce a catalogue as a partner contribution to the project. The exhibition will provide a forum for post-colonial reflection by communities served by the bibles exhibited, demonstrating the reception and afterlives of bible translations from the colonial era.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX001881%2F1

In 2014 the AHRC funded five First World War Engagement Centres to work with community groups to explore the legacies of the First World War. Responsive to community agendas, the Centres offered skills workshops on recording local heritage, and digitization; content specific workshops based on using archive/museum collections or linked to commemorative events; and workshops which explored through a 'temporally inflected lens' issues around silences, representation and memorialisation. The result was that the Engagement Centres created unique community-academic collaborations, generating new knowledge about the First World War and about the value of the past to communities living in the UK today.  However, the nature, context and consequences of the centenary could only be fully appreciated at its conclusion. Similarly, the practices of co-production and multiple partnerships across universities, community and heritage organisations, demonstrated their full potential at a series of the cross-Centre Festivals across the UK in 2019. This proposal responds to both sets of outcomes. The First World War and its Legacy 2020 and Beyond: Community, Collaboration and Conflict aims to sustain the social and cultural impact of the work of 'a thousand hands' of citizen researchers through the co-design and co-production of a series of e-books which will keep in circulation community research as a living resource and in doing so offer a model for future heritage policy around community engagement and national commemoration.","Who might benefit from this research? - The four lead community Co-Investigators, who are citizen historians, community activists or heritage makers, and who bring distinctive audiences of participants, practitioners and specialists; - Community participants who will be active in co-curating the project: adult learners, young people and BME community activists; - The wider communities that engage with, or support, the project partners and participants, including under-represented or culturally marginalised groups in the UK: BME; young people, particularly those with experience of disadvantage; adult learners; older people and people with dementia; - The community groups whose First World War (FWW) research is showcased in the books; - Independent researchers whose First World War (FWW) research is included in the books; - History communities and audiences interested in the FWW, including community activists and community organisations, citizen historians, members of the public; - History communities and social groups who may be considering their own heritage research project on the FWW or other topics; - Professionals interested in the potential of public history and heritage projects, including policy makers, civic society mediators, heritage professionals, cultural practitioners, research funders (e.g. the National Lottery Heritage Fund) and research users; - Academics and HEIs with a focus on public engagement, research co-production and widening participation. How might they benefit from this research? - Community Co-Investigators will share leadership and therefore ownership of the project; - Community Co-Investigators who have not previously worked together will form new relationships, with potential for future collaboration on other projects;  - Community participants will develop four new producer/user communities; they will have opportunities to gain experience and life skills through heritage in a supportive environment; - History groups and independent researchers will be recognized for the new knowledge they contributed during the FWW centenary; they will become visible stakeholders in the project;  - Community groups across the UK will have opportunities to realise the extent to which they share specific historical interests with researchers elsewhere and therefore make new connections; - Independent researchers, who often lack a support network and sounding board for their ideas, will be able to engage with others with similar interests; - The books will bring under-researched and unfamiliar FWW stories to a wider audience; - Through a series of summative reviews and guides to future research, the books will sustain the community research legacies of the FWW centenary, minimise the risk of future duplication and loss of expertise, and inspire further enquiry;  - The books aim to capture the learning relationships which enabled the generation of new knowledge about the FWW and its legacies; - Collective reflective practice will facilitate the development of a model that nurtures community research networks and relationships with HEIs, and meets the expressed needs of community-based researchers.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV001329%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Many languages show seemingly arbitrary elaboration of their inflection. For example, most English nouns can take a plural ending, but it is not the same for every noun: compare bird-s, ox-en, and phenomen-a. Exactly which one to use is an additional fact that must be learnt and remembered. In this case that might not seem all that great a task, but there are languages which far outstrip English, adding an extra layer of seemingly gratuitous complexity to the already considerable machinery that languages employ for the expression of meaning. Within a general theory of language, such morphological complexity is rather the elephant in the room: it is far from clear what it's doing there, and why it is taking up so much space. One of the most extreme examples of inflectional variation - the most extreme, we would argue - comes from Seri, a language isolate spoken by approximately 900 people on the Sonoran coast in Mexico. According to the best information we have there are over 500 inflection classes for the paradigm used to mark subject and event number (i.e. whether the verb subject is singular or plural, and whether the action occurs once or multiple times). This dwarfs anything we are aware of in any other language - for the sake of comparison, note that this is seven times the number of classes that French has, a language well known for the complexity of its verbal system. This makes the Seri verb system something of a nec plus ultra of morphological complexity: crack this, and the puzzle is cracked once and for all. Note that the complexity of this system involves far more than can be conveyed by a mere enumeration of the number of endings or the number of classes. First, unlike e.g. English, there is no clear division between regular and irregular verbs: irregularity pervades the entire system, so that it is hard to make even an educated guess as to what the forms of a given verb would be. A second complicating factor comes way forms are distributed in the paradigm, which prevents us from assign a fixed function to the morphological formatives, and adds to the set of facts the learner must acquire. Nevertheless, the system is not chaotic, and follows a strict morphological hierarchy. Whether this hierarchy reflects aspects of meaning or is morphologically autonomous is a question of considerable theoretical and typological interest, as we are not aware of parallel examples from other languages. A third complicating factor is meaning. Verbs mark subject number, which is a relatively familiar notion, but also event number. What this actually means remains far from clear. Cross-linguistically, number can be a property of events in a variety of ways, from simple quantification to inherent characteristics of the verbal meaning . What it means in a given instance depends partly on verb meaning and partly on the situation being described. Given how little we currently know about the semantic and syntactic principles underlying the system, it could be that at least some portion of the morphological complexity can be traced back to as yet unrecognized aspects of meaning or function.   These data provide us with two major research opportunities. First, the morphology of verbal paradigms - in its proliferation of classes, in its unpredictability, and in the variable functionality of its forms - has attained a degree of complexity with few parallels in the languages of the world. Second, the meanings and functions subsumed under the rubric 'event number' represent a category which is the subject of lively ongoing research cross-linguistically, and whose status within a general theory of grammatical systems is still being defined. We will work directly with speakers of Seri in Mexico, using various techniques of elicitation to help explain the morphological, semantic and syntactic factors behind this unique system.","Speaker community Our work will have concrete benefits for the community. As with other small languages, Seri faces a difficult future, especially as Spanish is slowly encroaching upon the spaces where Seri has traditionally been spoken. Additionally, classes in the primary and middle schools (grades 1-8) in the Seri villages are taught in Spanish. Seri is not taught in the school system, nor are there any pedagogical materials available. We will create materials for school use, based on our close work with the speakers, that can be used as a vehicle for language maintenance, linguistic awareness, and a source of pride for the community.  General public In addition to the benefit for the Seri speaker community, we see also foresee a benefit for non-Seri individuals whose awareness will be raised as to the complexity of the Seri language, provoking not only interest in the language but also awareness for its conservation. In a national context of language loss and dominance by Spanish, we expect that the presence of an international group of linguists working together with Seri speakers will raise awareness for the importance of studying and preserving the linguistic diversity found in Mexico. Our plans for engagement with the general public are outlined in the 'Pathways to Impact' attachment.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP002471%2F1

It is also one of the handful of inland waterways which continued to be used extensively for commercial navigation after the development of first the main-line railway system and later modern road transport. Most interest in the history of inland waterways in England has been concentrated on the period between 1660, when the main phase of river improvement began, and about 1850, when most traffic previously carried on canals transferred to the railways. Much less has been written about commercial carrying on inland waterways after this period, or about the administration of the waterways themselves, or about either those who worked and lived on the waterways or riverside communities, both of which had a very distinctive character. Nothing of this sort has been done in the case of the Trent. This project seeks to remedy this gap in the literature of transport history in Britain by looking in detail at how trade and traffic on the Trent (and associated canals) changed after 1850 as a result of the coming of the railways, and then changed again after 1918 as long-distance road transport developed. It will also consider how the Trent Navigation Company, the canal companies and later the British Transport Commission and its successors responded to demands to improve the Trent and the associated canals, and with what success. Finally, it will look at life on board boats on the river and the canals, and life ashore in riverside communities whose economy dependended, certainly at the start of this period, on proximity to a major commercial waterway. The project will be undertaken in partnership with the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge, who are restoring a former working barge (the 'Leicester Trader') as a floating heritage centre for the river and have already collected a large amount of oral testimony and written and photographic evidence for the recent history of commercial navigation on the Trent. The project, through a programme of public engagement events, will also actively encourage other voluntary organisations (town and village local history societies, the Railway & Canal Historical Society and riverside communities generally) to be involved. The programme will be facilitated by the named researcher, Philip Riden, who has a long record of working with community groups on local history projects and has established links with the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge. The main sources for such a study are the records of the navigation companies themselves, records created by parliamentary committees considering bills promoted by the companies and by railway companies, published Parliamentary Papers, records of central government departments responsible for regulating commercial inland navigation, records of local authorities (chiefly as sanitary authorities), records of statutory undertakers such as drainage and river catchment boards, and any records that survive of private carrying companies (and, in the case of those incorporated as limited liability companies, their returns to Companies House). In addition, for the general history of riverside communities a wide range of standard sources for 19th- and 20th-century local history can be used, and for the most recent phase of the subject oral testimony from those involved in the river will be an important source.","This project builds on the 'Writing Our History, Digging Our Past' project funded under the Phase 1 Research for Community Heritage Programme. This Phase 1 project was very successful in engaging local community groups, especially local history and archaeological societies, with the University and the academic each involved. The project team are now putting forward a Follow-On Fund bid to support up to 15 community groups and two Co-production Awards for project with particular potential for collaborative research. This proposed co-production project will involve a direct partnership with the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge and, through the planned programme of activities, aims to engage other voluntary organisations and community groups in the project. The community partners we are aiming to work with include the Railway and Canal Historical Society (the main national body in the field), town and village local history societies and riverside communities generally. The future impact of the project also rests in our collective ambition to use the results of the collaborative research to help the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge develop a heritage centre for the river on board their boat, the 'Leicester Trader'. The boat is already open to the public on a number of days a year and receives numerous visits from schools, local history societies and other groups. This project will enable the Friends to enhance their displays interpreting the history of the river. The Newark Heritage Barge is the only project devoted to the history of the Trent and the only waterways heritage project based on a boat not in a building. It is therefore in two respects a unique venture.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007637%2F1

How can groups extend their communities of participation through their existing networks? How can groups communicate with and potentially work with people who may share their ground but not their interests or values? 'On Shared Ground: networks and encounters around the margins of community heritage' unites academics from a range of disciplines with community groups to work through these questions. Research will take place on three hills, in three different countries. Academics from The University of Sheffield, Cardiff University and The University of Aberdeen will work with three community groups to map existing networks and facilitate new encounters in order to identify and potentially work with those in and around the margins of community heritage.  The research has developed in response to an identified need by participating community groups to tackle the abuse and misuse of heritage landscapes whilst simultaneously promoting the care and use of these spaces. Working with communities on each site, academics will work with groups to map their existing networks and foster dialogues with other users of the landscapes. This will be achieved through a series of improvised activities on the sites, where community groups will potentially 'encounter' other users. These encounters will be recorded using a variety of methods drawn from the research expertise of participating academics and informed by the practice and experience of the project artist.","It is anticipated that this project will have impact in both academic and community contexts. It will advance current community heritage models by enabling and promoting the ability for community partners to further collaborate and co-produce research with groups beyond their immediate networks or in the 'margins' of their communities. By testing this approach across three sites, in three countries, this project is designed to serve as a pilot for further development of existing community heritage models. We will:  1. Generate new knowledge and approaches through a series of workshops with community groups at three sites.  Workshops will unite researchers from different disciplines with community groups in order to explore the efficacy of a range of creative techniques and research methodologies in opening up new interpretations and experiences of heritage sites. The content generated during these workshops and subsequent autonomous activities, led by the community groups, will be collated by the project artist into a short-film. 2. Enhance the research capacity, knowledge and skills of our community partners and their ability to connect with the wider community.  Community participants will be introduced to a range of research methodologies and approaches as well as a host of techniques with which to record their involvement with the project, ranging from visual and textual contributions to the project blog and the use of audio-visual technologies to more traditional research methods, such as ethnographic field notes. Following workshops, groups will be encouraged to work independently. They will be given three weeks to work with specialist equipment, gather material and apply the research skills they have acquired during the workshops. Our workshops will explore 'networks' and 'encounters'. By mapping existing networks and relationships to the space we will work with groups to identify the dominant users and related narratives associated with this use. Facilitating 'encounters' will connect the participants, and in turn, the research, with parts of the community and users of the sites we are yet to identify. 3. Log our methods and processes in a variety of media: online, in film and in a co-authored article.  The project blog will serve as a place for investigators, project participants and the project artist to record field notes as well as other visual and textual records. We will encourage the use of video and audio clips as well as visual imagery with a view to creating a digital scrapbook of contributions from community participants from across the three sites. The dynamic and immediate nature of the project blog will also encourage those beyond the project team and identified community groups to contribute to the project and record their involvement or 'encounters'. This web resource will also serve as a useful tool of reference for other academics and heritage professionals as well as individuals and communities interested in heritage research. The site will also be promoted via social media platforms and shared more broadly across academic and community contacts established by each HEI. The film will knit together footage from the three sites and will be edited in consultation with community participants in Sheffield. The final film will be shown at an open-air screening in Wincobank which will be attended by academics and community partners from Cardiff and Aberdeen. The film will subsequently be hosted on the website and promoted widely across our networks. A co-authored article reflecting on the methodologies, processes and findings in the context of existing approaches to community heritage will represent the academic output of the project. It is anticipated that all of the investigators and the project artist will contribute. It is hoped that community participants will also contribute to the article.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013207%2F1

There is a risk that valuable tangible and intangible forms of nuclear cultural heritage will be lost and that social inequalities might be perpetuated in the process. NuSPACES will collaborate with different stakeholders to document and examine the creation of nuclear cultural heritage in three countries, the UK, Sweden and Lithuania and to shape a new agenda for research and practice in this field. It will explore, first, the ways in which different social groups at local communities, nuclear industries and national cultural organisations engage in creating museum expositions and heritage sites in the process of selective preservation of their nuclear past. Second, it will explore the role that nuclear cultural heritage can play in the process of decommissioning nuclear objects, for instance, providing new categories and types of materials to be preserved in the archives that are being assembled to inform future management of nuclear waste depositories. Third, it will contribute to the internationalisation of local and national nuclear cultural heritage-making activities by establishing a platform where stakeholders will be able to share their experience and shape future agenda for research and practice in the field in conversation with academic researchers.

People with dementia and their families often become disconnected from society through the stigmatizing effect dementia has on taking part in everyday activities. Added to this, the current economic climate has meant reductions in many services, and there is often a lack of meaningful activity available to this population. Yet many people with dementia wish to remain within their communities, in the home of their choice, near their family, carers and friends, with the support of health and social care services. This research aims to address the disconnection and marginalisation of people with dementia and explore how the vision for dementia supportive communities might benefit from creative activities. Specifically, it will use a visual art intervention as the catalyst for change for understanding community connectivity, challenging attitudes and promoting well being.  Research to date, although limited, suggests a number of potential benefits of arts participation to the quality of life, health and well-being of people with dementia. This project wishes to build on this to address a new area, which will maximise the involvement of, and potential benefit to communities. It will look at how participation in community arts interventions can increase well-being and connectedness between the dementia community and wider society. It will also examine another new area, to further understand the underlying processes that create the connection between arts participation and good outcomes.  To realise the aims, the research will be set within three areas of the UK. These consist of ethnically and geographically diverse communities to contextualise the research. In each area our project partners will deliver the same visual arts intervention over a 12 month period to different groups. To understand the impact, the research will assess changes over time in the well-being and social connectedness of people with dementia, and how these changes can in turn have positive effects in communities (facilitate change in societal attitudes and promote participation and inclusion) through social contagion. The processes and outcomes of the research will be assessed using a range of quantitative and qualitative approaches, and will use art, both as a tool for analysis and for visual, creative representations of the results. The research builds on existing relationships and develops new ones with community and policy partners, such as arts organisations, museums, galleries, health and social care practitioners, charities and local government. This will ensure full engagement and maximum benefit and impact for research, policy and practice. It will also contribute towards building future sustainability.","The research aims to demonstrate to central and local government, statutory and voluntary sector, health and social care providers, and community arts and cultural venues how they can contribute towards creating dementia supportive communities through visual arts as the catalyst for increasing connectivity, well-being and changing social representations of dementia. A strength of the proposed research is the range of potential beneficiaries (beyond academia) and the subsequent impact. Specifically: Impact through informing national policy: Dementia is a national priority. This research will contribute to the ambitions for Dementia Supportive Communities (WAG, 2011a) and changing awareness and understanding about dementia, enabling people to 'live well' (National Dementia Strategy, DoH). Partnership with the Alzheimer's Society will provide a valuable link to government policy making.  Impact to cultural policy: It is anticipated the research will make an important contribution to spending decisions within cultural policy, enabling cultural organisations, along with the wider arts and humanities community, to better evidence the impact cultural practice and research can have on communities, using the language and methods most closely associated with central government and Treasury's Green Book (HMT 2003, O'Brien 2010).  Impact to the third sector and local authority policy and practice: The research will assist with spending decisions, by providing evidence of the benefits to people with dementia, their carers, and the communities in which they live. The economic value will be of particular relevance in these times of austerity. This will be of direct relevance to policy actions in local authority health, social care and well-being strategies. The robust programme of research will contribute to developing thinking between health and arts sectors that engagement with the arts can be seen as a valid part health care. Charities will be able to use findings for advocacy purposes.  Impact to practice: The research consolidates existing theory and practice into the development of a new programme which will be robustly evaluated. The resulting output will be of high quality and thus of practical benefit to art practitioners and arts organisations, galleries and museums practitioners, the medical profession (including academics, GPs, medical students and care staff) and carers, who will benefit from understanding how to use art to improve quality of life. Understanding relationships within communities of practice will identify barriers and subsequent solutions to ensure maximum benefits to their work and those who receive their services.  Impact to communities: Older people and the general public as future older citizens will benefit through improved societal awareness of the circumstances of cognitive impairment in later life and outputs will identify how older people manage to maintain social and community involvement. Understanding the benefits/barriers will improve wider participation and connectivity, and reduce social isolation for people with dementia and their families/carers. Challenging negative perceptions and attitudes towards people with dementia is anticipated through planned exhibitions.  Impact through communication and dissemination: The research has drawn on some of the principles of implementation science to develop a knowledge transfer and communication strategy, which details organisations that will potentially benefit and mechanisms of engagement. The development work has established a national community of policy and practice, consisting of key stakeholders/organisations and people with dementia. Importantly they bridge and interconnect currently separate arts, dementia, health, social care & academic, policy & practice silos.

Using a widely disseminated web-mounted survey to take the temperature of the nation, we will ask the British public: who are our heroes today? Who were our heroes? Our intentions are four-fold. First, to establish the features or achievements of a person that contribute to their status as 'hero.' Second, to examine whether or not hero status is historically contingent. Third, to explore the way in which the historical selection of heroes can be seen to have assisted in the formation of ideas of national and community identity. And finally, to pose the further question: are heroes found or made, the latter leading to the fascinating issues: (how) can we build a hero? And how might hero-creation help to shape our futures? Working with two prestigious partner organisations, in the form of the Royal Geographical Society (London) and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery (Edinburgh), our cross-disciplinary team based at Newcastle, Aberdeen and Birmingham universities will undertake an integrated programme of research and dissemination activities to explore and analyse the hero figure past, present and future. The Hero Conference - a major international, cross-sector conference, to be held at the RGS in Summer 2015 - will bring together academic, public sector, charity, military and commercial participants to debate the hero figure, and its relevance to today's organisations and audiences. The accompanying 'Heroes of Exploration' exhibition will draw attention to the RGS's holdings, and the role of that organisation in shaping and archiving exploration heroics across the decades. At the SNPG, we will complete archival research and provide a new path through the collections via 'The Hero Trail' - a leaflet aimed at engaging the strategically important 16-24 age group. The research team will also complete journal articles on hero topics in our own areas of research, and mentor a Research Associate in doing likewise. Gathering further collaborators and interested parties across the year of the award, we aim to consolidate 'hero studies' as an important and engaging new field of research, with enormous potential for follow-on and spin-off projects.","Beneficiaries: - Academic fields including history, literature, politics, social sciences, war studies, philosophy and art history with an interest in 'hero studies,' a field we aim to consolidate and define (see 'Academic Beneficiaries') - Public/third sector organisations including art galleries, museums and archives, seeking to find new ways to attract audiences, and to guide them through their collections - Military organisations/those with responsibility for managing military reputation in civilian life - Charitable organisations connected to the military and post-conflict fundraising, including Help for Heroes, Walking with the Wounded, Royal British Legion, Royal British Legion Scotland, the Royal Scots Club etc. - Education policy units and thinktanks seeking new ways to engage students in literary, historical, and political studies - Other governmental organisations seeking to explore discourses of Britishness via analysis of British people's heroes, with a view to policy-making or outreach to particular constituencies - Commercial organisations tending to use heroism as an advertising trope/means of engagement, including (for example) The North Face, Berghaus, Burberry and Bremont chronometers - PR companies representing a range of organisations, seeking to use the hero figure to attract and persuade audiences Impact: With the hero a topic of contemporary public debate (see 'Case for Support' and 'Pathways to Impact'), 'hero studies' has potential impact beyond academia. Our partner organisations will assist us in exploring the value of the hero figure in 'slicing' existing archives and collections in major cultural institutions, and in attracting new audiences to engage with those institutions (see 'Academic Beneficiaries'). Co-I Nataliya Danilova's work in analysing the public portrayal of the hero figure by military/charitable organisations will offer a critique and analysis that will benefit her own field of politics/war studies, but it will also be of interest to her subjects of study. She will build connections with these organisations over the course of the year of the award. Those organisations may learn from our survey the characteristics of heroism most valued by British people today - potentially useful in positioning their own 'heroes' to drive donations and voluntary work.  Given the exploratory nature of the award, those areas of impact are the team's focus. However, 'hero studies' has two further areas of substantial potential impact: education, and outreach/marketing. One way to organise the contemporary curriculum for politics, literature and history is a focus on hero figures (and a critique of the notion of the hero). Governmental or independent educational thinktanks and policy-makers might, if briefed on our survey findings, make use of our statistics in curriculum debates. Governmental and commercial organisations, and the PR companies that support them, will also be able to make use of our findings regarding present hero figures, the ability of certain heroes to 'survive' or retain standing across the generations, and the role of heroes in establishing a national or community identity. For example, The North Face's team of present-day athletes, used to advertise their products, could be supplemented by a 'legends' team of past explorers and adventurers, who might appear in advertisements in order to make further statements about the brand. Summary: The scope of THP is restricted in order to ensure feasibility in the one year of the award, and we focus on potential impact for academic and cultural institutions, and the engagement of new audiences in the collections of our partners. However, the further constituencies listed above can easily be briefed regarding the new data set that emerges from our survey, and many sub-projects and impacts are possible within those fields. These might in turn contribute to our own further activities if follow-on funding is secured.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM006271%2F1

The work will focus on two thematic areas (i) gearing up for increased collections development, and (ii) connecting to the research infrastructure.  A comprehensive collections development and management plan will be written, following consultation with key stakeholders, and enhancements will be made to the repository platform to add enhanced capacity and functionality for submitting new collections.

The new institutional research strategy at UoN (2022 - 2027) is shaped by our ambition to be a 'university without borders;' a key tenet of which is to 'build shared facility and infrastructure platforms' in order to support inclusive and supportive transdisciplinary partnerships. In keeping with this, we are seeking to ensure that our arts and humanities research on palaeoenvironments is visible, sustainable and accessible in the long term. The Faculty of Arts has already invested in specialist technical support to oversee the day-to-day running and upkeep of six laboratories and provide technical supervision/training in the use of equipment and techniques to relevant staff, students and researchers. However, there remains an urgent need to replace and upgrade essential research equipment and facilities that will improve our interdisciplinary network's capacity for creative and cultural responses to historic pollution and climate change research.  The new equipment and facilities will be used to highlight the human stories of past environmental change; where and how societies have been resilient in their responses to changes and how these compare to the current consequences of human-driven climate change. We do this work in partnership with organisations from the UK's creative and cultural sectors, working together to make these stories visible so that they can be understood, made meaningful to our lives and society and thereby influence the behavioural changes we need. We also work to protect cultural assets from the effects of climate change in partnership with their managing organisations.  To ensure that our research continues to have meaning into the future we will build digital archives to host our paleoenvironmental data, our interpretations and creative outputs, to make them accessible, findable and reusable to new and diverse audiences. By hosting these together, we will maximise the power of an interdisciplinary approach to create research outputs that can be more widely communicated and understood.  To ensure that our network continues to benefit from this investment, we will train partners from across the different sectors of our network, to use the new facilities, equipment and archives. Working together across disciplines will act as a catalyst for further developing diverse responses to contemporary challenges using historic pollution and climate change research.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX009890%2F1

However, production of UK fashion is highly dependent on global supply chains where workers in the Global South in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India and Sri Lanka provide the labour to grow cotton, spin yarns, knit and weave fabrics and ultimately make the garments we wear in the UK. These supply chains have been associated with major ethical issues which can include various forms of discrimination, poor pay, bonded labour, child labour and dangerous working conditions. These issues are now best described by the umbrella term 'modern slavery'. But the fashion industry also provides employment for over 250 million workers, and for many workers fashion supply chains offer an opportunity to alleviate poverty, access education and develop social mobility for themselves and for their families. Therefore, the challenge for designers, brands, policy makers and the UN SDGs is how to eradicate issues of modern slavery, while retaining the positive aspects that fashion can provide for workers in the Global South. Eradicating modern slavery and creating sustainable supply chains is vital for the future of the UK fashion industry and for the planet. However, too often policies, initiatives and discussions aiming to improve sustainability and address modern slavery issues fail to understand and accommodate the complexity of these supply chains, the diversity of actors and the voices of workers involved in the journey of fashion from cotton farms to UK wardrobes. This project will describe this journey and its complexity using the voices of workers in the supply chain. Through collaboration with workers in India, it will create visual, audio, written and digital content that brings their hidden voices to stakeholders in the UK. By collapsing the cultural and geographical divides between producers and consumers, this content aims to facilitate dialogue about the connections between the clothes consumers in the UK wear and the workers who make them. These human stories will help designers, consumers, educators and policy makers improve their knowledge and awareness of the global fashion industry. The innovative content will be co-designed and delivered through collaboration with Leeds Museums and Galleries, the largest local authority-run museum service in England with one of the most significant multidisciplinary collections in the UK. This will be supported by the Public Engagement and Arts Educational Engagement Teams at the University of Leeds and the AHRC funded Future Fashion Factory. The project also supports the University's commitment to public engagement with its research and to the UN SDG accord. This Follow-On project builds on a previously funded AHRC project 'Impact of Covid-19 on management to eradicate modern slavery from global supply chains' (RC Grant reference: AH/V009206/1). This project, a collaboration between the University of Leeds and the Goa Institute of Management, India, explored the impact of the Covid on modern slavery risks for workers in fashion supply chains from the perspective of UK consumption and Indian production.  The research project highlighted how solutions for sustainable fashion must reflect the priorities of the supply chain, and how established Global North views of fashion have ignored Global South perspectives. This has implication for the delivery of the UN SDGs, particularly for following SDGs which are the focus for this Follow-On project: - SDG 5 Gender Equality; recognising the majority of workers in fashion are female, - SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; the fashion industry is a route for poverty alleviation and GDP growth in the Global South, - SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production; understanding the link between fashion consumption in the UK and production in India.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW006936%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project's plans for positive social impact follows on from earlier research, the interdisciplinary project 'Troubled Waters, Stormy Futures: Heritage in Times of Accelerated Climate Change'. The original research project focused on ways in which coastal communities in the UK and in the low-lying island nation Kiribati were affected by coastal flooding and inundation. We sought to more fully recognise the ways in which heritage, whether built or natural, tangible or intangible, was directly affected by current or projected climate change. National and international discussion of climate adaptation was failing to fully acknowledge the ways in which climate change was affecting heritage, sense of self and place, and contributing to people's vulnerabilities. This project respond directly to the short, medium and long-term needs identified by diverse communities and partners, and plans to address these in collaborative and empowering ways. There will be continued community-level engagement at two sites with our community partners. In the Durgan area in Cornwall, we will continue to facilitate dialogue within and between the local community, the National Trust, and the visitors who often form deep attachments to such coastlines. To support this endeavour in an enjoyable and meaningful way, an artist will be commissioned to helps those involved express their attachments to their coastal and cultural heritage, and to reflect upon their feelings about the future. The resulting work will be made available to the general public. This approach is based on the research finding that building relationships at a community level may contribute to social cohesion, resilience, feelings of belonging and effective co-stewardship of a better understood, dynamic coastline.  A different approach will be used in Kiribati. Here, we found that despite the long term threat of displacement, communities were focused on the everyday challenges of regular coastal inundation and various environmental problem directly affecting health and wellbeing. We encountered researcher-fatigue in Kiribati, and a feeling that constant external fascination nonetheless fails to produce direct benefits at a community level. Consequently, we will work with the local environmental organisation, Kirican, to deliver and resource a program of community-led initiatives, education and outreach. By working with Pelenise Alofa, affiliated with both Kirican and the Pacific Centre for Environment and Sustainable Development at the University of the South Pacific, we will also be supporting her ongoing effort to establish a locally managed climate change adaptation network. This is in keeping with one of the general principles of long-term community resilience: that this is something which needs to happen concretely and proactively at a local level, and with the support of local or regional organisations. Within and between communities and heritage organisations, there is frustration at the challenges of communicating climate change. A number of our partners, including the International National Trusts Organisation and the Museum of World Culture, Sweden, also want a more pivotal role for heritage organisations in the arena of climate change and adaptation, public education and advocacy. Manchester Museum will host a workshop to combine expertise, and we will create a freely available toolkit to help heritage organisations with climate change communication in future. This project respond to a clear demand for heritage concerns to be mainstreamed in international climate change negotiation, by utilising partner networks and disseminating the multi-media resources created in the original project, which amplify urgent voices from Kiribati. There will be a cultural exchange opportunity, hosting a heritage specialist from Kiribati at UK museums to enhance capacity and networks for medium and long-term heritage management including, potentially, for a post-displacement future.","1) Individuals and communities living in Kiribati will benefit directly from an opportunity to participate in an in depth-consultation with grassroots environmental organisation KiriCAN, whereby they can identify their own environmental priorities, and co-decide on suitable practical or educational strategies for addressing these. Proportional to the scale of funding, they will be able to work with KiriCAN to deliver tangible objectives, for example, by installing rain harvesting devices in their local community. Such strategies could enhance health and wellbeing, and also produce a foundation for further meaningful co-working in future. 2) Individuals and communities living in Durgan, as well as visitors to the area, will have the opportunity to participate in new or ongoing consultation about their own feelings about environmental challenges, such as coastal flooding, threat to coastal heritage, management responsibilities and planning for the future. Their views will be passed on to the landowner, the National Trust, with Dr Onciul acting as a facilitator between the residents and the National Trust. They- and others in the wider area- will have an opportunity to participate in an arts project with a commissioned artist, to celebrate their cultural heritage, and learn from each other. Visitors to the site will benefit from the opportunity to experience the resulting creative installation. 3) KiriCAN will benefit from an opportunity to apply their knowledge and networks of environmental expertise in a project driven by the local community. Their enhanced organisational capacity should produce long term benefits to both themselves, local communities in Kiribati, and strengthen the existing initiative to establish a locally managed climate change adaptation network. As co-founders of KiriCAN, Claire Anterea and Pelenise Alofa (also affiliated with the University of the South Pacific) have a long history of working to promote local resilience to climate change, and this project will further nurture them as environmental champions, playing an essential leadership role.  4) The National Trust will benefit as project partners. Locally, in Durgan, this project will support a deep local engagement to maintain and strengthen their relationship with local residents, and help to inform visitors to the area about coastal heritage and climate challenges. New ideas about effective engagement approaches could further benefit the National Trust more generally, and be used to devise new and effective ways to engage other coastal communities. This will be valued by the Trust, as one of their key objectives (as highlighted in their Shifting Shores report) is to engage local communities and the general public on coastal adaptation. 5) A range of specific heritage organisations involved in this project will value the fulfillment of their own ideas, initiatives and priorities, tied into the activities and networking in this project. For example, Manchester Museum welcome the opportunity to lead a process of creating a climate change communication toolkit for heritage organisation. The Newport Restoration Foundation value the creative audio-visual resources shared by the team for dissemination on their website, historabovewater.org, and the Museum and World Culture in Gothenburg are pleased to present the film 'Troubled Waters' in Sweden. The International National Trusts Organisation, with over seventy member organisations worldwide will find shared creative material useful for their presentations at future COPs, and will invite the team to contribute to an IPCC assessment report on the effects of climate change on coastal heritage. Many heritage organisations should benefit from the creation of a free, downloadable, climate communication toolkit, created with guidance by Climate Outreach, lead specialists on climate communication in Europe. We also provide opportunity for knowledge exchange for a heritage professional from Kiribati.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP00959X%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The proposed research network will explore how the teaching of social practice can be improved for arts practitioners through partnership between cultural and higher education institutions. It will use online communications to test practical possibilities for augmenting learning through collaboration across national boundaries, and investigate other benefits that networking across institutional and geographical divides can bring. The network will result in the formation of a nascent community of practitioners, cultural providers and educators to encourage cooperation, exchange and possibilities for greater future collaboration. Communications will commence between a core of four arts institutions and universities in the UK and US, two countries that are, relative globally, foundational to social practice arts and its education. This will then be expanded into a wider network. The core organisations are Tate Exchange and Middlesex University (UK), and Queens Museum and City University of New York (CUNY) (USA), each with specific experience of supporting social engagement in art. Social practice is a growing phenomenon amongst artists globally, who are increasingly drawing on their creativity to address urgent intersectional issues of social and environmental justice. There are nevertheless still relatively few opportunities to formally develop the knowledge and understanding needed for effective practice in this field. The nature of learning for engagement in the wider social sphere inherently questions whether it could be more effectively achieved by drawing on a wider pool of experience than UK HEIs have to offer. It is envisaged, particularly in relation to current developments in decolonizing arts education and museum provision, that much could be achieved through collaboration and exchange supported by online learning strategies. The project will progress through bringing together representatives from other cultural and educational centres of expertise, including institutions in Ireland with its significant legacy in this field. An initial half-day online symposium will facilitate discussion and the sharing of ideas. This peer-practitioner-educator dialogue will lead to a series of four half-day online workshops for emerging artists from UK and US locations, hosted by each of the core organisations, to test possibilities for longer-term future programmes. A face-to-face exchange hosted by Tate Exchange and Queens Museum will support this work, enabling in-depth dialogue and the sharing of methodologies and learning strategies between the different organisations. The programme will culminate in a full-day live-streamed virtual symposium where programme findings, outcomes and outputs will be demonstrated, discussed and disseminated. With wider international participation, this event will address how future learning in this field can be expanded through cooperation, exchange and ongoing networking. The work will be informed by a Project Advisory Group of established practitioners, educators and artists, together with alumni of Middlesex and CUNY courses. The main benefits of the research will be realised through future collaborations leading to educational initiatives that can offer greater support to emerging artists in this field. These will benefit through discovering new and effective ways of developing their work in the social sphere, which will in turn aid the publics and environments with which they engage. Artists, educationalists and academics will gain perspective and ideas for different ways of delivering educational activities, while workshops participants will have opportunity to gain skills and experience. Dissemination through journal articles will not only be aimed at academics and cultural institutions, but also arts practitioners via professional publications.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW004208%2F1

This Sanskrit text has been the most influential text on physical yoga, both in India since its composition in about 1400 CE, and globally since yoga started to spread across the world in the late 19th century. The Light on Hatha has been translated hundreds of times into several languages, but these translations are unreliable because they are of based on nine or fewer of its more than 250 manuscripts, which present widely different versions of the text, ranging from three to ten chapters. A team of scholars will trace the Light on Hatha's transmission and publish it in a critical edition which will foreground an authoritative version of the most influential version of the text and detail all its variations. By thus mapping the transmission history of this text the project will document the premodern development of physical yoga from its origins in the early part of the second millennium CE as a method of mysticism practised by heterodox ascetics in India, to its early modern apotheosis as a somatic soteriology available to all, prefiguring its current phenomenal worldwide popularity as a means to wellness. Two key reasons for the Light on Hatha's not having been critically edited despite its great popularity are the large number of manuscripts in which it has been transmitted and the difficulty of its subject matter. The expertise of the project team mitigates both these problems. The team's members are all expert in editing Sanskrit texts from manuscripts, and the work of two of them, Mallinson and Birch, has focused on texts on physical yoga. Nearly half of the c. four hundred verses of the most influential recension of the Light on Hatha are drawn from earlier texts, the most important of which Mallinson and Birch have edited in their previous work. The team is thus uniquely positioned to produce a critical edition of the Light on Hatha. In addition to the Light on Hatha, the project team will produce editions of two other texts which are less well known but important for making sense of the history of yoga. These are: (1) the Yogalaksanavali, ""The String of Signifiers of Yoga"", an as yet unstudied treatise on yoga which was composed in 1549 CE and includes quotations from several texts, including many which were used in the composition of the Light on Hatha; and (2) the Tattvabinduyoga, ""The Yoga of the Elemental Point"", a 17th-century taxonomy of 15 different yoga methods, which includes hathayoga and is thus an early example of physical techniques being absorbed into mainstream yoga.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV003275%2F1

Interventions in 'unloved' museum collections' explores the role of enthusiasm, creativity and affection in the stewardship of 'unloved' or under appreciated collections. The project asks how care for objects has varied over time, and in relation to different time periods. It also considers what this experience means for how we care for collections in the future. Most significantly, from the professional curator to the serious hobbiest, to the nation as a whole, we consider who cares about collections and why. The core team will bring together their collective expertise to interrogate, rediscover, engage, and experiment with collections of seemingly mundane or everyday objects. Through a combination of theoretical dialogues and action research case studies the project will examine the affective components of stewardship, engagement, and collections-based research. As well as considering who cares about collections now and who cared in the past, this project also aims to develop strategies for opening these collections up to a wider audience. These interventions include workshops with teenage non-participants, events for an adult audience at national museum, focused workshops for enthusiast groups, and collaborations with creative practitioners. Many of these interventions have been tried by museums in the past, but in the course of practical museum work there is often little time to research what these brief events mean in the context of the full life of the collection. The project is focussed around 3 case ctudies: 1. Science Museum Group: The Lock Collection is a comprehensive record of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, ranging from the elaborate to the everyday. Until recently a small proportion of this collection had been on display in the 'Secrets of the Home' exhibition but it will soon all be in storage. This case study will work with the Lock Collectors Association who describe the study of locks and their history as a 'specialised sector of Industrial Archaeology'. Dr Hess will explore the role of community enthusiasm and national museums in keeping this kind of collection alive in the public imagination even when they are not on display. 2. Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust: The National Slag Collection housed at Ironbridge comprises an enormous number of samples of archaeo-metallurgical residues. Most of it was collected and processed by the former Ancient Monuments Laboratory (now the English Heritage Centre for Archaeology). The collection includes samples from excavations undertaken on sites of all periods across the country since WWII. It has been augmented since 2000 with samples from recent excavations undertaken by Ironbridge Archaeology and others. Working with young people and the Historical Metallurgy Society, Dr Woodham will explore strategies for reinvigorating this collection. 3. Museum of English Rural Life: This 'Designated' Collection' was formed by academic collectors and private enthusiasts and holds multiple regional examples of certain kinds of objects, in this case hand tools. As the Museum embarks on a HLF funded redisplay the thematic scope of these stored objects is once again being explored. Working with crafts associations, students, enthusiasts and collectors groups the project will explore the histories held in MERL's hand tool collections. Dr Smith will draw on current research into collectors and collections at MERL and examine the role of nostlagia, crafts and enthusiasm in shaping connections with these objects. Though very different, these collections face similar issues. In a world where time, money and space are at a premium within heritage organisations, finding innovative ways to meet these challenges becomes all the more important. The project engages with experimental forms of stewardship by bringing traditional stakeholders together with new audiences. In this way it explores creative solutions and imagines new futures for these collections","Cultural impact is pivotal to the proposal. Workshops will bring together academics with heritage professionals, enthusiasts and students. Through facilitated creative, exploratory and discursive activities these groups will share skills, knowledge, experiences and perspectives. This will feed into enhanced interpretation for the museum collections and create partnerships and develop skills and knowledge which will last beyond the life of the project. 1) Project Partners *The recognised project partner is Ironbridge, however professional staff at MERL (University of Reading) and the Science Museum (IRO) will also benefit from the project and pathways to impact will be similar for all organisations. Staff in these organisations will benefit from working with academic researchers on a collaborative project. The workshops will engage them in new partnerships or strengthen existing partnerships. They will learn more about their collections and experiment with different ways of thinking about the significance of stored collections. Through enhanced impact activities they will also benefit from expert consultancy which will allow them to engage with non-participants or focus the interest of casual participants.  2)The wider heritage sector As well as the specific individual impact generated through working with our participants we will be using these examples to reflect more generally on the nature of collections care and the role of the general public. Through involving both academics and museum practitioners these solutions can be executed in concrete and specific ways: by ensuring institutional partners are involved from the project's inception, practical and implementable ways of public engagement will be addressed from the start. This adheres to the principles of action research.We are particularly looking to produce open source materials with recommendations on collections care. 3) Enthusiasts and interest groups Enthusiast and interest groups (historical societies, collectors groups, craftspeople) will develop new or strengthen existing relationships with collections professionals and other related groups. They will have the opportunity to work with non-participants and recieve assistance from creative practitioners and consultants when considering methods of making their specialist area more engaging for new audiences and generations of curators. 4) Non-participants The project will deliver enhanced impact activities at partner sites aimed at groups who do not participate with museums or who only participate with displayed rather than stored collections. - The partnership with the Science Museum will facilitate engagement with a diverse audience; developing outputs as part of the Science Museum's LATES programme which attracts on average 10,000 visitors to each event.  - At Ironbridge and MERL investigators will work with the creative practitioners and an expert in engaging teenagers in museums to deliver workshops aimed at this group.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM006123%2F1

"Funding details                                                                                                              This research has a dual focus: it will compare two different forms of contemporary public art and their significance for the development of reflective and engaged citizens in Ilfracombe, Devon, and it will develop an innovative arts sensitive method to work with visual data and visualisation, with the aim of locating the study in cultural experience. It will deploy this alongside a 'citizen's forum', a focus group based 'citizen's forum' to assess their respective merits in enabling members of the community to express their feelings and opinions of these two artworks. The findings will have significance beyond the town and inform policy makers, arts commissioners, evaluators, academics and the arts and cultural sector on the kind of public art most likely to promote identity, belonging and citizenship; also the mechanisms whereby these effects are achieved and can be evaluated  In 2012, Ilfracombe was home to two public artworks: the temporary visit of Alex Hartley's Nowhereisland and Damien Hirst's twenty year loan of the 66 ft bronze statue, Verity. These two very different kinds of public art came together in the same year in the same small coastal town.  Nowhereisland involved the journey of an artificially created small island from the Arctic to the south-west coast of England as a visiting 'island nation'. As it travelled through international waters, the island was declared a 'new nation' with citizenship open to all. Preparations for the arrival of Nowhereisland had already begun eighteen months previously, with activities and events involving local people exploring the meaning of local and national citizenship within a globalising world. Hirst's Verity was created as a 'modern allegory of truth and justice'. It towers over the waterfront, the tallest example of public art in England. People travel many miles to see it, stimulating regeneration and tourism in the town. Neither artwork has escaped controversy and local citizens have expressed a range of opinions and feelings, positive and negative, about the value of such public art. This research will ask what meanings and values these artworks represent for the local community, why, and in what ways? By facilitating debate in a citizen's forum, and an innovative method of associating to visual data, the research will be looking to understand how the arrival of the artworks is embedded in local memory and imagination, their ongoing effects and lasting legacy for people, individually and as part of the wider community.  These questions will be researched with: a literature review, a media and archive review to understand the initial feedback and reactions to the artworks; short interviews with stakeholders and biographical narrative interviews with the artists to understand the artworks' importance in the artist's life work and their intended significance; the Citizen's Forum will stimulate debate and there will be a visual matrix for each of the artworks. This innovative method accesses the visual imagination and those aspects of artistic experience which cannot easily be expressed in words. It will provide opportunities for creative community engagement by introducing ways of expressing feelings and ideas through images that often arise when looking at art. In the visual matrix a group of around 35 participants will be able to express their relationship to Nowhereisland and Verity by offering pictures and images that come to mind when thinking about the artworks. In this way the complex emotional reactions and ideas connected to citizens' appreciation of the artworks can become available for interpretation and analysis by the research team. The findings from the different data sources will be compared and combined and fed back to the participants for further discussion and refinement. The team will report and disseminate the research through web and print based media, conference, seminars and workshop.","Impacts Summary (with methods of dissemination in brackets for cross-referencing) Beneficiaries of this research will include local and national funders, commissioners and policy-makers concerned with the value of public art in promoting civic engagement, inclusion, identity and citizenship; the arts sector concerned with how to produce public art to realize these aims; the arts and social scientific academic community concerned to understand the nature of the relationship between cultural experience and citizenship; communities who are offered the opportunity to experience informed and strategically commissioned artworks; evaluators who are offered new tools for researching experience as well as process and outcomes of public art projects. Specifically the project will:  - evidence the value of different kinds of public art to citizenship and the means whereby this contribution is realized to inform funders and commissioners, local authority policy-makers and planning departments, especially in relation to contested decisions for which there is little research based evidence. These concern temporary processual projects versus artworks with long-term physical presence. This project will evidence the type legacy of a temporary public artwork might establish compared with a permanently sited commemorative sculpture or integrated design within the built environment. (Situations summit and online report)  - Inform funders and the arts and cultural sector about appropriate methodological principles for the evaluation of place-based public art projects beyond the commonly used on-site questionnaires and surveys. (Situations summit, seminars, report and book chapter)   - provide evaluators with a practicable, affordable and tested methodology for researching cultural experience (academic dissemination, methodology article)  - Develop concepts to describe the nature of public engagement with public artworks, with a particular emphasis on the constitution of reflective and engaged citizens. (academic journal, book and report)  - Refine and share expertise on forms of negotiation, advocacy and communication necessary to bring about such impact within the professional art sector. (seminars)  - Promote local engagement and deliberation with respect to the legacy of verity and Nowhereisland (vis the group data collection and feedback process itself) - Develop theoretical insights on the psychosocial pathways where by different kinds of public art achieves its effects and its potential impact on social relations within communities (academic dissemination) - Inform all stakeholders about how intrinsic, instrumental and institutional dimensions of public art act in combination to achieve these impacts (All channels)",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL006189%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Collectively, we now create more data in two days than we did in all of 2002. Whether it is the 4 B pieces of content shared daily on Facebook, the 200 M tweets, more than 5 B of us intensively produce unprecedented and unfathomable amounts of social data whenever we text, browse, post or generate content on our phones. We call this Big Social Data (BSD), and it entails the symbolic content we generate as will as the metadata our phones emit, tracking our bodies through time and space. Recent revelations about the NSA and GCHQ reveal just how data centric our society has become. Yet you could say we suffer from a data democracy deficit. As such, it is more important than ever that public understanding of our information-rich environment and our quantified selves improves. Our research project 'Our Data, Ourselves' seeks to democratise BSD. Big data has already been widely identified as a key economic driver. We seek to turn it into a community asset and develop tools, applications, formats and practices which will enable important new research on and using BSD by arts and humanities researchers. We see community as being articulated though social and communicative practices, the very wellspring of BSD. These mediated practices impact traditional communities, those based on place and identity, and create new communities, especially with young people, those 'born digital.' We will partner with youth coders in the Young Rewired State network as co-researchers, and gain privileged insight into how the mediated connectedness manifested by BSD is transforming communities. We will work with our young co-researchers to develop tools and applications for the capture, storage, and analysis of BSD. We will create an open environment for BSD research and develop an ethical framework for data sharing available for widespread community use. We envision a BSD research commons, respectful of privacy concerns, and engaging young tech-savvy communities to gain a greater understanding of the data-intensive digital culture of mobile environments. Our research aims to enquire into the elements comprising one's personal archive of BSD. This entails examining the symbolic content we generate and the metadata of our devices, which map our bodies in time and space, as well as the infrastructure, in which data is stored, searched, shared, analysed and mined. This will facilitate a better understanding of the kinds of social connections, information sharing, and normative relations we are developing to and through BSD.  A major challenge is in the development and transfer of the technical skills and knowledge necessary for the capture and analysis of the different forms of BSD, and its transformation into community research data, available to researchers, those who generate it, and their communities. The basic issue raised is whether BSD can be transformed into a public asset and become a creative resource for cultural and economic community development. The basic problem addressed is that we do not own the BSD that we generate. From the moment we tap 'send' it moves and is processed in a highly proprietary environment where it remains inaccessible to us, typically returning only in the form of targeted ads. In short, we seek to transform proprietary and inaccessible BSD into open research data that becomes an accessible community resource. We develop a freely accessible, open source online market place for tools and applications enabling the extraction of BSD from smart phones. We engage in hackathons to develop these tools, and engage privacy concerns, developing anonymisation technologies and produce policy white papers on ethical data sharing. We seek to turn BSD, which is currently primarily fodder for targeted ads and surveillance into a community resource available for creative use. If it is 'our data ourselves', our BSD commons will empower us to use it in new ways, both in community and by arts and humanities researchers.","All components of our work deliver direct impact, as detailed in the Pathways to Impact and the Case for Support. The main impact, however, will come from working with Young Rewired State, a network of young coders who have participated in Hack Days for Refugees United, UK Aid, and the Department of Education. Young Rewired State is a leading community organisation in teaching youth coding skills through practical projects in situ, most prominently in their annual Festival of Code. We envision this project as the first step in a longer-term partnership with Young Rewired State, which has coder networks across the UK. Further, Young Rewired State is the philanthropic arm of Rewired State, which is a network of more than 1,000 software developers and designers with whom we intend to actively collaborate in the future.  Through Young Rewired State and other collaborations in the project, namely with the Open Data Institute and the Open Knowledge Foundation, we will engage a range of other stakeholders in digital culture research in mobile environments from social media researchers to mobile phone companies. This will enable us to capture the requirements of different groups within this broad field while forging networks for future research on digital culture, especially in regards to big data. Our collaboration with Young Rewired Space will create a new interdisciplinary community for arts and humanities research, given its deployment of humanities and arts skills in the analysis of technological space. Further, our focus on hackathons, a co-research practice borrowed from our partner Young Rewired State, affords both innovative and effective means for community engagement.  Our partners will be co-researchers throughout the entire project cycle. They will generate big social data in-community, and work with us to develop the tools and applications for both its capture and analysis. The end result will be an open environment for big social data research that engages young tech-savvy communities in researching the digital culture of mobile environments. Discussions with our partners identified a range of needs and questions that they considered would benefit from knowledge exchange with arts and humanities research. These can be clustered around the following: i) The impact and potential of digital technologies, digital culture and digital practices and the forms of communication that surround and inform us  ii) The changing nature of engagement with the mobile environment where young tech-savvy users contribute more and more directly to the development of tools and services  iii) Cultural transformations where academic, cultural and creative organisations are challenged to connect with new forms of knowledge in new environments. These organisations need to consider the new power structures in these environment as well as new audiences, which include spectators but also a range of diverse communities that actively transform these environments. The primary impact of the project will be providing practical experience and critical thinking about the process and importance of digital culture research in exploring the big data components of digital personalities. We would expect all participants to end the project with: i) A wider understanding of what constitutes digital personality, both explicit and tacit, in a mobile environment ii) Applied experience of extracting and representing knowledge in a mobile environment, in particular in relation to personal information iii) A method and digital assets for involving a wide range young coders to participate and contribute their knowledge and insights in future digital arts and humanities research vii) A culture, in which arts and humanities research assumes an integral role in the analysis of mobile environments  viii) An understanding of the nature and form of the interactions that best support this culture.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL007770%2F1

(a charity dedicated to improving the quality of life for older people in care by enabling their participation in meaningful activity) to continue to work with us to further embed the project outcomes in their practice and in care settings more widely. Community engagement is increasingly recognized by the care sector and commissioners as vital in tackling issues of social isolation in our older populations living in care settings. Together with Alive! we want to co-design engaging community spaces (parlours) where older people can interact with evocative objects and our app to record and share their memories and life histories. This will involve imagining and creating a new space of discovery, connection, meaning making and mystery, rather like the 'cabinets of curiosity' or 'wonder rooms' of old. Unlike cabinets of curiosity, our 'Parlours of Wonder' will not be designed and curated by us as arts and humanities researchers, artists/designers and computer scientists. Our vision is that these spaces will be co-curated by and for residents, care staff, families and community members. Care managers believe there is huge potential to use these Parlours of Wonder for community engagement where local school children, community groups and isolated older people will be encouraged to enjoy a cup of tea and a chat or a more formal encounter, sparking questions, connections, new interests or opportunities for contemplation.  This project has been jointly conceived and developed with Alive!, with artists and with an extra care facility in which we have worked on the Tangible Memories Project. Funding from that research enabled us to co-design and to test our prototypes in the settings. We believe the prototypes, in particular our app, have huge potential to enhance opportunities for older people living in care homes to connect with those in their local community and therefore feel less socially isolated. We know that this will require a change of culture in many care settings and thus working closely with care staff to co-design new spaces of encounter in these settings is vital. This project builds on and further extend our excellent working relationships with Alive!, Blaise Weston Court (an extra care facility) and Hanover Housing, but will extend our activities to reach new groups including BrunelCare, the Britannia Centre (a day care facility) and Deerhurst (a large care home specializing in dementia work). It will also enable us to work closely with policy makers and other influencers to expand the local and national project reach.","The beneficiaries of this project will be far reaching and diverse: Care settings, staff and managers will be provided with a 'blueprint' for the design of Parlours in their settings. They will also have access to a quality training toolkit. Through the careful recording, reflection and evaluation of all our processes we will produce case study reports of each of the sites as a publication viewable online. These case studies will be hosted both on our own TMP website but also on the Alive! website to ensure the widest possible audience. Take up of the ideas will enhance their provision and be looked on favourably by the CQC who inspect care settings nationally.  Care staff will have an opportunity to work with design partners and researchers to engage creatively in co-designing spaces in their own settings but also in thinking seriously about the future of care settings and their links to communities. They will benefit from further training to develop their expertise in designing and delivering multigenerational activities and in using objects and the app to enhance these activities.  Care home residents will benefit from engaging creatively with us in co-designing spaces, participating in the multigenerational activities we design, learning more about the use of digital technologies and objects and being encouraged to share their stories with others, particularly those of different generations. We know from the TMP that this often leads to increased confidence, lessens the experience of social isolation and improves quality of life.  Family members will benefit from being provided with more creative ways to engage with the care settings and their relatives and as we have found on the TMP this can enable them to feel more connected to other the activities going on in the settings and more likely to visit thus potentially decreasing the social isolation of older people. The app draws in grandchildren and great grandchildren who might not currently visit often.  Young people/schools/community members will benefit from engaging with these creative spaces and from the multigenerational contact that flows through these spaces. The resources provided in the Parlours will enable young people and community members to connect physically with objects from the past and to hear the personal stories associated with the objects that will bring community histories Alive! in new ways. In addition, the contact with older people will provide an important learning opportunity in relation to challenging their preconceptions of older people, perpetuated in the media and elsewhere.  Bristol Ageing Better, Age UK and policy makers working in this space will gain important data on the process of co-designing care homes for community engagement through the case studies we will produce. We will use these case studies to produce a Policy briefing outlining some of the key issues we experienced in the process of co-designing the spaces and activities which will be distributed through our strong networks. In addition, to ensure the project is well communicated to this audience we will present our case studies and training materials at the local 'Celebrating Age Festival' where we have already publicised the TMP, and at national practitioner events such as the Dementia Congress.  Museums and galleries have begun to develop connections with older people living in care through several projects (eg Alive!'s innovative work with the Wallace Collection and the Russell Coates Art Gallery and Museum). However there is huge potential in our work using objects to tell stories that would be of interest to curators and other museum staff. Our case studies will provide useful information that could potentially enhance their provision. This will be enhanced through our co-curated exhibition of creative work. This project will enhance Alive!'s (our partner) offer to care homes thus improving their capacity to develop and grow as a charitable organisation.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN009568%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              In recent years, it has been argued-increasingly-by government and business that we ought to conceptualise the natural world as 'natural capital': that we ought to think of nature as a kind of 'capital', just like machinery or money are classed as 'capital'. We live in a capitalist society: but then (so it is said) we risk not 'counting' nature adequately if we don't count _it_ as capital, too. The idea is that if we do conceive of nature in this way, it is possible to secure a 'rigorous', market-based method of putting the value of nature at the heart of decision-making, whether at the level of government, private enterprise or the individual.  Our aim in this research network is to think through the assumptions behind the characterisation of nature as a form of capital. In particular, we propose to address an issue that appears to underpin the concept of natural capital: how we conceptualise the _value_ of nature. We will explore the extent to which the monetary analysis of nature's value, with its apparent emphasis on the substitutability of 'pieces' of nature for other such 'pieces' (so called 'biodiversity-offsetting', for example), can accommodate: (A) the specificity of particular places and habitats; and (B) the complex interdependence of these places, habitats and ecosystems, considered as necessary parts of a functioning whole, a whole (ultimately, our planetary home) that needs to be kept resilient. To what extent, in other words, can _economic_ analysis capture the actual dynamics of ecological systems? Do quantitative analyses of natural value alienate key stakeholders, who relate to and interact with nature in non-quantitative ways? Does it make sense to think of a forest as essentially money waiting to be harvested; or as a special or even sacred place? What resources does the philosophical tradition offer that should help us conceptualise nature in a more holistic way? To what extent does the idea of nature providing what are increasingly now called ""cultural ecosystem services""-such as forms of non-material, spiritual fulfilment-mitigate worries about utilitarian or reductive tendencies in the natural capital approach? How exactly ought we to understand our aesthetic and religious and leisure-ly experiences of nature as valuable in relation to human health and well-being; just how exactly can nature nourish us? For example, is my experience of the beauty of a landscape a _cause_ of my well-being or an irreducible _component_ of it? Is the idea of ""cultural ecosystem services"" in conflict with the notion of nature having ""intrinsic value""? Should we be troubled that talk of 'natural resources' or 'ecosystem services' stresses what nature has done for us, but doesn't encourage us directly to ask what service we should be providing to nature? Our bringing together interested parties from across the spectrum -- including politicians, artists, and interested members of the public -- will help clarify what is at stake when we address these urgent issues and questions. We aim for what we come up with therefore to impact the way that governments and bureaucrats compute and decide these questions of how to 'count' nature. We intend to introduce a Cambridgeshire-focused perspective into the project by examining the question of the value and application of the concept of natural capital in relation to one particular site: the East Anglian Fens. This will, we believe, concentrate minds; and enable what can seem abstract questions to be seen in their concrete reality. What is/are the value(s) of Fen-lands? The research-network will begin by bringing together interested parties (mostly from the east-of-England region), and we intend for it to end by producing new policy-proposals for how to think the value of nature. The results of the network will be made directly available to the public at an Exhibition, in a panel-discussion and an open conference, and online - as well as in the local, regional and national media.","The questions our project will address have the utmost contemporary relevance. E.g. Currently there's an ongoing review of the effectiveness of the EU Birds & Habitats Directives, with the Commission report expected in 2016. The concept of natural capital will play a major role within this review and so it is very important-and urgent-to gain greater clarity about potential arguments for and against this approach. Likewise, the idea of ""payment for ecosystem services"" is already a tool used by governments in their approach to biodiversity protection and thus of immediate national and local concern. In this context, we intend our project objectives to be realised in part by means of the following impacts:  >The one-day conference/networking event at ARU, on the ethics and politics of PES and Biodiversity Offsetting, in the last 6 months of the project, will be given focus by a 'case study' approach with a really practical focus: on thinking about how the value of nature in southern Cambridgeshire / the East Anglian Fens ought to be conceptualised. It will aim to draw in members of the public, local businesses, and representatives of local and national politics. It's proceedings will be recorded and made publicly-available via: >A permanent archive from the research network, linked to and sustained by the Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute (GSI) website, providing a base for follow-up projects. This archive will include a blog, which will be used to provide a virtual medium for dialogue between the network participants before, during and after the workshop and conference. This web-presence will prominently include the 'map of salient terms' described elsewhere in this bid: our aspiration is for this to be of wide use 'in the field'. >An exhibition, open to all, hosted by the Ruskin Gallery, ARU, on the East Anglian Fens. This will take place toward the project's end and will include a wide range of visual, aural and written media, specifically on the Fens, with the purpose of encouraging further reflection on the idea of natural capital and ecosystem services. It will include the ARU Sustainability Art Prize and additionally an open call to artists: both on the theme of 'Unquantifiable nature?'; it will also include a major commissioned sound/video-art work on broadly the same theme; and a Panel discussion, wherein some of the core research-network participants will have their ideas showcased in interaction with a wider public. To generalise from the above: we seek to: >Feed directly into public policy by offering new theoretical and methodological perspectives on the monetary valuation of nature. (We have already secured a commitment from Molly Scott Cato, MEP, to take part in this aspect of the project.) >Create multi-stakeholder networks that have the potential to generate new, interdisciplinary solutions to biodiversity conservation.  >Develop the University of East Anglia and Anglia Ruskin University as together forming a major international hub for research and collaboration in the area of the (pure and) applied philosophy of sustainability, and so showcase eastern-England UK-based researchers at the forefront of debate in a crucial area of public and political concern.  >Further understanding within Cambs of the issues surrounding sites of local interest. Finally: >Key members of the network will discuss the research etc. on radio, in newspapers and on television throughout the duration of the project (as well as on the basis of the opportunities that the Exhibition will provide): some of the core team (incl. Read, Jones, Anderson, and Kenner) already have extensive experience in so doing, and in particular extensive and current contacts in the local media, both print and broadcast, in both Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, and to a significant extent also nationally: N.B. We already _have_ an expression of potential interest from Radio 3's 'Freethinking' programme in our ideas.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN006232%2F1

Through Gateways the British public will be given the opportunity to engage with, understand and interpret a historical event that played a fundamental role in the shaping of the contemporary world and their place within it. In exploring the local, wherever located, they will engage with the global. They will also engage with their own preconceptions and be encouraged to test and question their origins. Gateways will then use this as a base to examine the (dis)connection between academic/official history and popular perceptions. Gateways will use the combination of its recognised research strengths and high profile in First World War Studies, practitioner skills, resources and geography to explore themes universal to the experience of the First World War:   The global nature of the conflict. The importance of the sea and overseas communications. The blurred line between fighting and home fronts; how people understood the nature of the conflict and the acts of combat. The effect of transplanting communities and creating new ones. Moments of culture clash and moments of culture harmony. How different memories and legacies emerged from the conflict, why some endured, mutated or were marginalised.  Gateways has three elements:  1) Core members: building on the existing research interests and public engagement links centred on the First World War anniversaries between Brighton, Greenwich, Kent and Portsmouth HEIs. For example, Kent and Portsmouth are developing a research network exploring the experience of Imperial port cities during the conflict in association with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies; Greenwich and Kent are working on a programme for schools and colleges; Brighton and Portsmouth have collaborated on a photographic project with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. 2) Project collaborators: extending and exploiting existing partnerships with non-HEI bodies for the benefit of the wider community. Examples include: Chatham Dockyard Museum, Cognitive Media, Hampshire County Council, Kent County Council, Maidstone Museum, Marlowe Theatre (Canterbury), National Maritime Museum, Portsmouth City Museums, Royal Engineers Museum, Library and Archive (hereafter REMLA), Screen South, War Memorials Trust. 3) Network members: drawing in other academics from a wide range of disciplines with expertise relevant to the objectives of Gateways. For a list of key network members see pp6-7. Gateways is geographically based in a region that has a unique historical status: SE England was the Gateway to the Western Front and was the hinge on which the British war effort hung. Its ports of Southampton, Newhaven, Folkestone, Dover and the naval bases of Chatham and Portsmouth were the nodal points. The region was a militarised zone covered with defence lines and fortifications including the British army's main base at Aldershot. It was a liminal space between fighting and home fronts; a cultural and racial melting pot containing imperial contingents (Africans, Canadians, Indians and West Indians), Chinese Labour Corps camps and large numbers of Belgian refugees. The region became the home of vast hospital encampments which further ensured that the presence of the war and its effects remained constant.","Gateways to the First World War will make a considerable impact based on its core overarching aims:  That the British public is given the opportunity to engage with, understand and interpret a historical event that played a fundamental role in the shaping of the contemporary world and their place within it. In exploring the local, wherever located, they will engage with the global. They will also engage with their own preconceptions and be encouraged to test and question their origins. Gateways will then use this as a base to examine the (dis)connection between academic/official history and popular perceptions.    It will use a broad range of platforms and partnerships to ensure that its events and resources are disseminated and achieve a high profile including a purpose-built website, use of social media, programmes with schools, colleges, museums, archive centres, galleries and international collaborators. Local communities and the wider public in general As noted above, connection with communities is the key to Gateways' plan. It will provide a wide-range of people with the skills and confidence to engage with academic research according to their own interests, develop new partnership and community links and inspire a lasting legacy.  The Third Sector Gateways will enhance relationships with existing partners still further and pioneer new links. It will demonstrate fully that both HEIs and the third sector can interact fruitfully to mutual benefit which then also enhances the lives of the wider public. Examples of existing partnerships include: Museums, galleries and archives: Brighton Pavilion and Museums, Chatham Dockyard Museum, Cognitive Media, Kent County Council Archives, Libraries and Museums, Maidstone Museum, National Maritime Museum, Portsmouth City Museums, Royal Engineers Museum, Library, Screen South. Of great interest is the ability to interact with the Flanders Field Museum, Ieper/Ypres due to the research overlaps enhanced by geographical proximity which will mean an Impact beyond the UK. Key First World War-interest groups and organisations: War Memorials Trust, Western Front Association. The initial mechanism for harnessing the links will be the series of public engagement open days and follow-up events planned by Gateways. These will pave the way for further collaborative involvement in Connected Communities and Translating Cultures research applications particularly designed to investigate reactions to the centenary events and ensure comparative studies beyond the UK  The media Gateways members are already engaging with the media on the First World War centenary at a local, national and international level. Three network members took part in the AHRC-BBC national seminar and two have been selected in the recent AHRC-BBC scheme. The centre's commitment to a comprehensive public engagement process which brings together and effectively harnesses cutting edge research with community interest will ensure a high and regular profile for the centre in the media. Further, the research interests of Gateways very much overlap with areas of media engagement. The communications offices of all Gateways institutions are aware of the significance of the anniversary and are committed to ensuring that the research expertise of its members is highlighted. Policy-makers, governments and public sector agencies Gateways will provide a flagship case study for the UK government and public sector agencies on large-scale academic-community involvement which can be drawn upon to inform approaches to similar high-profile events such as the forthcoming Second World War (75th) anniversary cycle.

The project also aims to study audience engagement by exploring novel ways of recording and interpreting user responses to performance and embedding these in Tate's displays. It is a collaboration between the Centre for Intermedia at the Department of English at the University of Exeter and two departments at Tate - Tate Research and Tate Online - in consultation with Tate's Digital Learning Department and its Copyright Department and collaborating with Tate's curator for performance. The project is especially timely because of Tate's opening of the Tanks, the 'first spaces dedicated permanently to live art installation and performance in any museum building anywhere in the world' (Sir Nicholas Serota, BBC, 23/4/2012). The outputs include an innovative online archive, an edited book, a project documentation blog, a workshop, a conference and two articles. Performance at Tate originated in the 1960s when performative works were acquired by Tate and a number of early performance works and talks were hosted by the education department. In the intervening decades more performative works were acquired and a number of exhibitions and events staged. After 2003, and with the introduction of Tate Live and then the Tanks, Tate's programming of performance became more systematic, and an increasingly diverse range of documents, including films, photographs, texts from programmes, artist statements and correspondences were collected for over 200 performances of artists such as Merce Cunningham, Joan Jonas, Christian Marclay, Surasi Kusalwong, John Cage, Trisha Brown, Carlos Amorales, Cai Guo Qiang, the Guerrilla Girls, Sung Hwan Kimn and Suzanne Lacy, to name but a few. Some works included live performance; others were born digital, but still performative, like Argentinean born artist Pablo Bronstein's Constantinople Kaleidoscope (2012), an entirely new work made especially for the Performance Room, which involves a group of dancers on a trompe l'oeil stage set that exaggerates the perspective of the room. Some had audiences, others were interactive and user-led, like Pawel Althamer's Film 2000, a performance trailer for a film that is never made which requires actors famous in a given part of the world (in the UK Jude Law) to perform in a location related to the museum. Some were documented extensively, by well-known photographers, like Martin Creed's installation in which 50 participants run through Tate Britain, which was photographed by Hugo Glendinning in 2008. Others, like Tino Sehgal's This is Propaganda (2002, and acquired by Tate in 2005) have no 'conventional' documentation in that the artist suggests that the work is taught to two members of the museum staff on acquisition who are charged with its remembrance. The result is an unrivalled collection of performance materials yet to be fully exploited. It is expected that the Tanks will generate a greater public appetite for and interest in performance, and increasingly involve audiences ('There is an incredible appetite for participation', Chris Dercon, Tate Modern Director, BBC, 23/4/2012). Tate's renewed and increased commitment to a performance programme, including the production of born digital 'live' work, requires that Tate now looks back at what it has established curatorially throughout the years, whilst also looking forward at developing new curatorial strategies for performance, including the development of multiple, interdisciplinary and participatory methodologies for performance documentation to ensure that the new commissions in the Tanks and elsewhere at Tate can effectively generate future legacies at Tate and, through the generation of a best practice framework, beyond.","Who will benefit from the research?  1) The general public.  2) The artists whose work is represented in the archive.  3) Other artists.  4) Other museums and galleries.  5) Tate. How will they benefit?  1) The general public: the public will benefit by being able to access the rich history of performance work at Tate as an online archive, and read about the project findings in the archive and blog (the archive will also have a set of longer essays aimed at the general public). The experience of the project, The Gallery of Lost Art, which was part-funded by the AHRC, was that there was enormous public enthusiasm for recovering the stories of 'lost' or no longer extant works through studying the material traces of the work's existence. We feel that the planned website will help restore to public consciousness a large swathe of works and events that risk being entirely forgotten or misunderstood. The public will also be encouraged to develop and add secondary forms of documentation to records generated by Tate and by the commissioned artists through the blog. These will be further disseminated via social media, hence potentially reaching audiences who are not currently engaged with the museum. Tate Online, the UK's number two website in the Hitwise 'arts' category for 2011-12, was fully redesigned in 2012 to ensure Tate will continue to attract and engage global audiences.  2) The artists whose work is represented in the archive: this user group will benefit by having a public record of their performance work at Tate published in an archive. There is currently no publicly available archive of this work.  3) Other artists: this user group will be able to utilise the online archive to learn about the lineage of performance work at Tate. They will also be able to learn and experiment with performance documentation strategies that might in turn help them to create legacies of their own practice.  4) Other museums and galleries: this user group will benefit from the fact they would familiarise themselves with Tate's curatorial practices over performance and performativity and their documentation over the years, and learn about and/or experiment with the use of novel approaches to performance documentation which might feed back into their own curatorial and preservation practices. A framework built through research developed by the project in consultation with different departments at Tate, including Learning and Copyright, is directly targeting this user group. 5) Tate: Tate will benefit because it will be able to investigate, archive, curate and make public a substantial and yet still under-researched body of its own work spanning over 50 years and including more than 100 artists. By developing new strategies to capture, document and replay live and born digital performance and performativity, including the user experience, a legacy of the curation of performance at Tate will be created for future generations. Findings about performance documentation, including the capture and documentation of the user experience, are likely to affect Tate's future collection, preservation and documentation policies. Finally, a focus on the capturing of the user experience, and the embedding of performativity and performance within canonical displays, is expected to lead to novel ways to curate performance work and manage its collection at Tate, something that the museum is keen to develop.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL003740%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project is about the visualising of literary place and space, using the digital medium in a way never before attempted to advance spatial understanding and interpretation of literary texts for a range of users. We view space and time in literature as a central element of the understanding and interpretation of texts, but one that is often overlooked. Literary mapping has the potential to bring it to the fore and allow it to be understood and appreciated in new ways.  Conceptually the project is concerned with solving a deceptively simple problem that restricts spatial exploration of literature, particularly in digital space, the problem of how to generate the ""base map"". Where a text is set in a space that appears to correspond to the real world (e.g. London in a Dickens' novel) this appears unproblematic, but where a text creates a world with no direct correspondence this becomes a major problem since there is nothing on to which to map textual elements. Our ground-breaking project aims to solve this problem by creating the base map out of the text itself, using place-names and other toponymic elements to generate map representations. Structurally, we will establish five core spatial genres for Literary Studies and create models of interpretation at multiple levels for a range of texts within each genre. Our innovative approach will enable a major step forward in the understanding and analysis of the spatial and temporal (chronotopic) dimensions of a literary work, with the potential to be relevant and of interest to academics and the wider public.  We will interpret texts and images by an iterative structure (returning upon itself) that connects visual and verbal representations and moves between them. So, a text is analyzed; maps are produced and the fictional world visualised; then there is a return to the text in the light of such spatialisation for in-depth analysis, enriched and deepened by the act of visualisation that mapping has given us. We are also interested in adapting gaming engines to the exploration of space and place in canonical literary forms, creating a range of maps and full 3D visualisations for different kinds of imaginative terrain and mapping at different scales. Our project will significantly enhance knowledge and understanding of digital tools for the spatial humanities, for literary mapping and for spatial approaches to the analysis and interpretation of literary works.  A brief explanation of how the project might work may be helpful here, taking Treasure Island as an example. At a macro-level the novel will need to be mapped in terms of three distinct time-spaces: England (home); The Voyage/ The Ship (transition); The Island (the ""other"" space of conflict and death). The first of these maps onto ""real-world"" geography (Devon), the second reduces space to the extent of the ship in motion; the third is set in an entirely imaginary (though authorially-mapped) place. These space-times (or chronotopes) exist sequentially within the narrative but also overlap and bear upon each other (e.g. the boy narrator, Jim, projects an imagined version of the island forward from home that the actual island confounds entirely). If we focus purely on the first of these we can see how ordinary everyday life at The Admiral Benbow inn is interrupted by the intersection of this world with that of the pirates and how Jim is sucked out of one kind of timespace or chronotope (safe, secluded, the space of childhood) into another far more exciting, but also threatening, one. In the case of Treasure Island, an authorial map is also given alongside the text so that the map is both inside and outside the narrative, functioning like a chronotopic beacon -- an object of power calling out to be claimed and reclaimed and shaping the narrative around it by manipulating through desire. Full visualisation of different chronotopes will allow us to respond more deeply to the rich complexity of such a text.","Impact is a core element of the project since it is concerned with bringing about a transformation through new tools and methods in terms of a particular academic field - spatial humanities - and with communicating new ways of understanding and exploring literary place, space and time to as large an audience as possible.  Who might benefit? The project is of use to the following groups: - Primary school teachers and pupils - Secondary school teachers and pupils - Universities in a range of Humanities disciplines - Libraries and special collections - Heritage organisations - Museums - Literary Societies - Literary Houses - Tourist Boards  - The National Trust - Local communities - The wider public visiting regions, interested in writers, using digital media - International visitors and tourists Impact is targetted towards three main non-academic groups: Educational Beneficiaries The project builds upon work already undertaken with schools in The Lakescraft Project by Bushell and Butler. This provides an existing network of schools in the North West region and beyond. For this project we will use the same structure for schools of creating worksheet materials to use alongside 3D visualisations and gaming platforms since this worked successfully before. We will establish a core team who are willing to work closely with us on the development of the materials and to work with the BL learning team (connecting to London schools). In Lancaster we will work in the first instance with Dallas Road Primary School and Lancaster Royal Grammar School for Boys where we have existing links. We will develop materials with the aid and advice of four teachers, bringing them onto campus for 2 day-long sessions in computer labs in Years 1 and 2. We will develop one set of materials for Primary school children aged 8-11 (centred on Treasure Island) and a second set for GCSE students aged 14-16 (centred on Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Lord of the Flies). The PI is also a fully trained secondary school teacher with previous experience of teaching in schools. Museums / Cultural Heritage We will create interactive interfaces that enable adults and children to play with the tools in the museum space and that engage people with literature who might not otherwise be interested. Working with The Wordsworth Trust and The British Library we will create a suite of training materials for librarians and other professionals relating to the online tools (also freely accessible) and run a Digital Scholarship course hosted by the BL. We hope that our tools will be adapted and used by those in the third sector, as well as by academics. The General Public  The public will have direct access to the digital tools that we develop through the project website which will be designed for maximum appeal and reach. The digital tools themselves will also be designed as toolchains of existing tools to maximize flexibility and re-usability. There will also be directly interactive elements on the site for users to engage with. How might they benefit? We believe that mapping and visualizing literary space and time opens up new ways of analysing literature, and thus of understanding spatio-temporal representations and the spatial nature of our own existence more fully. This is of benefit to all, in different ways. The first level of impact is conceptual and intellectual to fellow academics working in this field and related disciplines whose own work can be advanced and taken in new directions by it. The second level is for those working in the third sector for whom the tools may be developed towards as yet unforeseen ends. A third level of impact occurs in schools where we seek to open up the experience of literary texts through spatial and visual means to the next generation. Finally, even those with digital mapping as a hobby can use our tools and share ideas with us and others.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP00895X%2F1

Indeed many scholars have raised concerns about the gap between academic interests for advancing knowledge for knowledge sake and the practical problems and needs of the communities studied by academics (Kelemen and Bansal, 2002).  Our collaboration is unique in that it has a dual focus on rigour and relevance and seeks to advance and promote a 'Pragmatist agenda' across the humanities, arts and social sciences. This Pragmatist agenda is rooted in the American Pragmatist philosophical school of thought represented by John Dewey, William James and Charles Peirce. Put simply, American Pragmatism may be described as a practical and anti-foundationalist philosophy that focuses on the future and is concerned with improving the conditions that enable individuals to thrive in their everyday lives. It collapses not only the artificial division between theory and practice, emphasising the link between knowledge and action, but also other restrictive dualisms (e.g. body-mind, subject-object), by a process of inquiry that understands knowledge as a practical activity and the value of theory by the practical consequences and actions it produces (Kelemen and Rumens, 2012).  By working together with our community partners, our international academic link and his community partners, we will reflect upon as well as share our existing experiences about advancing theories that meet the dual criteria of rigour and relevance. The project will benefit greatly from a cross-disciplinary approach in terms of both content and mode of delivery. Underpinned by a Pragmatist philosophical approach, the collaboration taps into narrative methods, dramaturgical approaches, visual studies, sociological theories, design studies and community studies. Its innovative mode of delivery includes open participant sessions, drama exercises, experiential workshops, story telling, visual methods and crowd sourcing in an attempt to address issues of language translation and cultural capital across academics and community partners.  The work of our Japanese partner which relates to and involves communities affected by the Tsunami (2011) and their way of coping with a crisis situation will benefit greatly our project by providing insights into an ongoing successful collaboration between academics and communities. Professor Kiyomiya's research focuses on what is considered 'actionable' knowledge by communities and what makes knowledge relevant, useful and/or practical at their end. We will produce two installations as a result of the workshops held in the UK and Japan that will tour various venues. The UK installation will also travel to Japan. We will disseminate our findings in conference papers and journal articles and will feed our lessons into the teaching curricula of the five universities taking part in the project.","Expected areas of impact are to: 1. provide best practice guidelines for academics who engage with local communities and community based organisations (CBOs); 2. contribute to local debates about regeneration by providing a forum for academics, local communities and CBOs to discuss and reflect on how they work together and how they can enhance their contribution to society; 3. contribute to public policy debates on the 'third sector' at a local, regional and national level; 4. strengthen the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom by helping communities become more self-reliant and resilient through the effective use of academic knowledge; 5. enhance the quality of life of individuals/communities by ensuring that academic research accounts for and permeates their day-to-day life; 6. develop creative outputs at the community level by promoting community engagement with academia and encouraging knowledge-sharing;  7. evolve effective methods for capturing community level ideas and needs, to improve targeted and sustainable solution development by Not For Profit and supporting organisations; 8. improve teaching curriculum in areas such as design and innovation, third sector management, epistemology, philosophy and research methodology; 9. demonstrate the usefulness of Pragmatism as an academic paradigm that can deal successfully with the practical problems of communities.  We will engage our beneficiaries in our project from the very beginning. We will host a two day workshop at Keele University and the New Vic Theatre. Given that participation at the workshop will be free of charge, we will attract not only established CBOs, policy makers, and academics but also career young academics, PhD students, and members of the community at large. This workshop will facilitate networking amongst different stakeholders and combine dissemination activities with more proactive aspects. Structured and improvisational activities will be used to brainstorm ideas for translating the key themes into best practice for each community group at the event. We will hold a similar event in Japan to encourage cross-fertilisation of ideas about working with communities across the two cultures.  Our project will also help CBOs understand the potential value, costs, risks, benefits, and practicalities of working more closely with local communities and academics so that they can make informed decisions. Drawing on our local and national CBOs network, there are many groups of immediate stakeholders who will benefit from this research. Based on our existing contacts, they will include Newcastle Council for Volunteering Services, Volunteering Action Stoke-on-Trent, and Staffordshire Moorlands Council for Voluntary Service along with groups of volunteers and practitioners from the New Vic Theatre, Volunteer Experience@Keele, the Stoke-on-Trent Museums, Citizens Advice Bureau Stoke-on-Trent and ELITE (Stoke-on-Trent).  In addition the Mondo Challenge Foundation, a charity focusing on education and livelihood development within deprived communities, will bring their expertise to explore the processes and resource options for capturing and interpreting needs and resilient community solutions. Such communities will become more self-reliant, as they can learn to identify and solve problems for themselves.  Creative disciplines and co-design practitioners will benefit from an improved understanding amongst CBO clients, and from the guidance reporting what works and what does not work in CBOs and similar Not For Profit organisations, e.g. small charities. Our project partner, the Glass-House Community Led Design, which has significant expertise and substantial influence in its field, will be the main gateway to attracting other beneficiaries such as Nesta and Talk About Local.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK006185%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will establish an international research network exploring the future of the Design School, through a partnership between Northumbria University School of Design, Charles Stuart University, Australia, the University of Southern Denmark, and the Design Museum London. By examining the contemporary situation of the Design School from a global perspective, the research network will explore how the structure of design learning and teaching, research and practice, is being transformed by a number of internal, external, and contextual factors and the implications of these changes for future iterations of the Design School. The network will explore the nature of the contemporary Design School and examine the rich and diverse situations that exist in design production, both in theory and practice, and the character of the studio/history/theory interplays that prevail in contemporary Design School life, asking whether Design Schools are shaping a new type of designer, or if tomorrow's designers will emerge from other professions such as business, health care, education, and computing, where design 'thinking' is now regularly applied.  This research network is proposed at a time when governments and markets across the world are actively reshaping the university and hence the Design School. In a time of rapid and intensive change, the network will foster new international relationships to shape the Design School of the future. The key aim of the proposed research network seminar series is to explore the future of the contemporary Design School informed by international perspectives from high level invited speakers from design education, culture and industry by asking: * How can a Design School in the age of the Anthropocene best prepare future designers for this complex world?  * How can the Design School maximize the potential opportunities suggested by this future, uncertain world at a time of rapid and intensive change?  * Having changed the planet how should the Design School react to the planet changing us? The research network will hold 3 symposiums reflecting 3 significant turns in the contemporary Design School. The first will focus on the current issues surrounding the Design School including the development of countless private Design Schools, increased distance learning, and national policies surrounding design education pursued by government across the world. The second symposium will focus on the increasingly close relationship between the Design School and the Cultural Sector. The third symposium will examine the increasingly intensive relationship between industry and Design Schools that will stimulate debate over future Design School policy and private companies' agendas. The collaboration between the research team in this international network will permit the network to bring together representatives from the expanding landscape of the Design School, which includes growing numbers of public and private educational providers franchising internationally, the design museum sector (also franchising internationally), representatives from the booming international design festival circuit, representatives from the emergent, mostly transdisciplinary postgraduate Design Schools, representatives from the editors of the mostly online design media, and influential practitioners engaged in design education. Since many of these influences are external to the discipline's traditional Design School model, but are shaping the learning of the designer, the 3 symposiums will generate the first advanced understanding of the probable trajectory of the Design School. The value of this research is in its rigorous examination of the future of the Design School. The audience for the 3 events will be international and comprise faculty heads and deans, museum directors, design educators, key design practitioners, festival directors and curators, publishers, members of the design media, and postgraduate students of design.","Key beneficiaries of this research will be researchers, educators, practitioners, and policy makers within the design community and elsewhere including those in academia, industry, public and government bodies. The research planned will examine how the structure of design learning and teaching, research and practice, is being transformed by a number of internal, external, and contextual factors and the implications of these changes for future iterations of the Design School. Both individuals and groups within the design community and elsewhere will benefit from this research. A rich, international network of researchers, educators and practitioners involved in the expanding landscape of the contemporary Design School will be established to explore the important issues. The research will impact design education providers (e.g. Universities, Colleges, Research Organisations, Museums, and Schools), design policy makers (e.g. regional and national governments and bodies - Design Council, Design Research Society, RSA, etc.), the booming cultural sector including representatives from the design museum sector, the international design festival circuit, editors from the largely online design media, and practitioners by examining the importance of the modern day Design School to a nation's overall GDP and subsequent health and wellbeing of its people. Moreover, this research will explore cross-national and cross-cultural concepts and attitudes towards the Design School.  The main strategy for addressing impact in this research network is through a combination of systematic but imaginative work, which combines creative practice-based research with sound empirically based research. In this sense, impact is primarily addressed through the quality of the research proposed and by the high calibre of the proposed international research network participants. The impact of this research will be managed and disseminated via a range of both national and international channels. The channels include regional networks for design companies, network participants, subsequent continuing professional development (CPD) workshops, and symposium events that will be open to the general public. Other channels will include public bodies and agencies, including those represented by the invited network participants who will provide an effective context for the dissemination of the research findings, as well as established and relevant conferences, journals and trade magazines. International channels will include the research project website, the Design Museum's archives, international journals and conferences, and other established research and industrial collaborations of the main investigators. The project's impact will start immediately once funding has been secured. At this stage the dedicated project website will be built and the Design Museum archive launched. Information on the proposed symposiums will be disseminated to the invited network participants for them to distribute, in turn, to an even wider international audience. More long-term impact will be managed via the development of an exploitation plan throughout the proposed research, exploring opportunities with each of the Investigators' Commercialisation Departments. The investigators and their host universities have a strong reputation in design research. Moreover, the institutions are excellent providers of dedicated training, CDP activities, and in capacity building support for commercial, public and third sector design organisations. The potential impact of the proposed research thus extends well beyond commercial contexts to include social, cultural and quality of life contexts. In summary, the range of exploitation channels is very broad, ranging from academia through to SMEs to multinational product and cultural and service organisations. Outputs are planned in a range of formats that allow us to match dissemination methods to potential beneficiaries.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003640%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Bloomsbury Festival is an established annual event dedicated to celebrating the cultural, intellectual and social wealth of Bloomsbury and its diverse communities. A registered charity, the festival supports community projects year-round that inspire positive change in people's lives through the creation of beautiful art. Via the AHRC-funded Bloomsbury Festival Cultural Engagement Project hosted by the School of Advanced Study, University of London (Feb-May 2013), in 2013 the Festival has drawn upon the interdisciplinary humanities research expertise in the School of Advanced Study to develop and refine its cultural engagement programme. Specifically, it has sought to find a means of both extending and critically interrogating the impact of its work with hard-to-reach and vulnerable social groups in the Bloomsbury and broader Camden areas. Identifying older people with dementia as a core population capable of multi-sensory cultural engagement, but typically unable to participate in the Festival's outreach programme, an early outcome of this project has been the establishment of a reciprocal relationship with Age UK Camden's Dementia Befriending Service, which supports people living with dementia in Camden.  Working closely with this service, and drawing upon the expertise of Dr Claudia Cooper--honorary consultant old age psychiatrist to the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust--the 'Bloomsbury Festival in a Box' project will between August and October 2013 develop, trial, and analyse a peripatetic 'Festival in a Box' outreach project that takes boxes of materials associated with the Festival out to people unable to leave their homes to take part in cultural life. As well as being therapeutic devices, these boxes will form innovative research vessels that will gather qualitative data on the value of cultural participation among older people with dementia in Camden. Carefully designed to include a range of sensory and cultural materials that will prompt narrative responses and recollections from service users, the Bloomsbury Festival boxes will engender social stimulation as well as interests in new activities, ideas and experiences among those living with dementia. The project will therefore benefit not only the individuals directly involved, but the broader research community.  The Bloomsbury Festival in a Box will offer service users a unique opportunity to participate in a cultural event from which they would normally be excluded, and will in turn raise awareness of those living with dementia via a highly respected cultural forum. Moreover, it will offer those living with dementia an opportunity to share their knowledge and stories of the area, providing history and insight into Bloomsbury and the surrounding locale. As some service users have lived in the area for many years, participation in the outreach programme will not only be an opportunity for them to actively re-engage with community life, but also to participate in re-narrating the history of Bloomsbury itself. Over the course of weekly visits to the homes of service users, these boxes will become miniature 'archives of engagement', gathering rich and unusual data over the course of the outreach experience.  A high level of interest in the proposed research project is anticipated, both within the area and on a national scale. Reflecting this, the final results of the project will be disseminated via a website and an academic publication, and via a one day event that will bring together practitioners and researchers in fields of gerontology and arts and health for a knowledge exchange opportunity intended to further the sharing of expertise and research methodologies in this field.","'Bloomsbury Festival in a Box: engaging socially isolated people with dementia' will have significant impact upon a number of fronts. Firstly, the research will seek to directly enhance the quality of life of older people living in isolation within Bloomsbury. Older residents taking part in the study will be offered a unique opportunity to engage with a cultural event (the Bloomsbury Festival) from which they have previously been excluded. Furthermore, by developing the collaborative relationships between academic, cultural, and community outreach organisations in the Bloomsbury area forged by the AHRC-funded Bloomsbury Festival Cultural Engagement Project, the research will also present an opportunity to strengthen the support network available to older people in Camden in a broader sense. Researchers and staff working on the project will benefit from working closely with older people in Camden, furthering academic skills in non-academic environments. Furthermore, the nature of the project's initial outcomes: in the form of a launch exhibition and debate, followed by academic publications and a knowledge share event, will benefit the broader academic community in the fields of social healthcare, gerontology, and arts and health. The dissemination of the first phase of the project via a high profile cultural event (the Bloomsbury Festival) will benefit the local community and the general public by raising awareness and encouraging debate around issues of ageing, dementia, and social isolation in contemporary Britain. This event will in itself work to explore the value of cultural activity in challenging stigma and prejudice in these areas. Both the Bloomsbury Festival and Age UK Camden will thus benefit from the project not only by being able to use the data gathered to more accurately refine their services and community engagement activities in the Camden area, but by raising awareness of their broader programme of outreach activities. Age UK Camden, particularly, will benefit from raising awareness of its volunteer 'Dementia Befriending Service'.  In the longer term, the research will influence further innovations in community outreach and engagement, and is designed to help influence policy decisions concerning social outreach and care for the elderly. Success factors taken from the research will lay grounding for the development of further innovations within the field, and may form a reference for training those working with socially isolated older people.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL005794%2F1

The investigations will combine guided archival research with the use of cutting-edge equipment acquired through an AHRC CapCo grant awarded to the School of Archaeology and Ancient History (SAAH) and will involve KS2/3 (7-13 years) pupils and young people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) (16-25 years). Participants will visit the archives to select and handle objects and will carry out guided archival research. They will attend interactive workshops where CapCo equipment will be used to investigate objects selected by participants. Their research and responses to the investigation will be showcased through a range of digital and pop-up displays co-created with staff from the organisations involved which will be incorporated within the interpretation at both sites. Accessible digital resources for Key Stage 2/3 and SEND teachers will be developed (including videoclips of the investigation) linked to SAAH's highly successful KS2/3 Life in the Roman World (LitRW) programme for schools. Through a workshop for teachers the project will show the potential of arts and STEM integration for enthusing and empowering young people as creators, innovators and leaders within their communities, and will strengthen and enhance existing research, learning and Knowledge Exchange (KE) partnerships between SAAH, local schools and heritage sites in the East Midlands. The project will provide training, mentoring, school and community engagement opportunities for early career researchers, professional archaeologists and heritage professionals, simultaneously building capacity within SAAH, University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), Leicester City Council (LCC), The Chester House Estate (CHE) and the Northamptonshire Archaeological Resource Centre (NARC).",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX000729%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Woven Communities: the Warp and the Weft aims to draw on practical basketry as an important tool for enhancing public engagement with museum collections and as a means of extending reminiscence work within museums and promoting design thinking. We will work with the Scottish Basketmakers Circle (SBC), our partners from an earlier project, and 5 new partners: National Museums of Rural Life, the Highland Folk Museum, the Scottish Fisheries Museum, Shetland Museum, and An Lanntair, a multi-arts centre on Lewis.  The project has four key aims. First, we will carry out a series of public engagement activities in museums linked to their basketry collections with the aim of eliciting life histories and social memories, and thus increasing audience engagement. We have found that making and demonstrating craft activities such as basketry are very productive in reminiscence sessions. Yet while artefacts are often employed as important reference points for eliciting social memories, the actual practice of making such artefacts is only now being considered. Secondly, we will draw on the technical benefit of basket-makers working with museum curators to enhance knowledge of early 20th century Scottish basketry collections. Thirdly, we aim to explore the significance of basketry for design thinking. Because basketry is not replicable by machine, many design processes such as planning, problem-solving and innovation are embedded in the practical act of basket-work. This has led us to consider the value of thinking-in-practice and dynamic problem-solving attendant on basketry, as an important aspect of design thinking. In discussion with CraftScotland and the Craft Council, we will develop a paper for informing craft policy on this theme. Finally, the interactive nature of our website has led to us being approached by An Lanntair, Lewis, which has requested we contribute to their bi-lingual (Gaelic/English) dementia project, drawing on our practical basketry skills for eliciting hand-memories with elders with dementia on Lewis To achieve these aims we will conduct practical reminiscent events focussed around workshops and replica making in each venue. These will range from making Easter straw bonnets, fishing creels and sculls, to Traveller basketry, exploring the whole process from gathering raw materials (such as heather) to finished product, and involving all generations. Through the regionally specific nature of these events, it may even be possible to link artefacts in collections with descendants of former users or producers. We will invite a Masters student from Museum Studies in St Andrews to document and upload the data as part of their dissertation project. We will video record practitioners making key basket forms to further document memories and discussion linked to the events. This will also enable us to extend our capacity for conveying skills, and provide legacy material for use by museums.  Outcomes will include increased public engagement with museum collections, and therefore enhanced impact, as more regional public contribute to knowledge about their own social history through practical engagement. This will lead to new and accessible insights to the social history of collections. Through working with makers, curators will gain improved documentation of collections. There will be greater understanding of the benefits of handwork for working with people with dementia; and of the value of handwork for design thinking through our policy document for craft and design education. Several of our partners have agreed to host study days tailored to their collections, which will further extend impact and public engagement, as will the international symposium which will form the culmination of the project. Several of our partners have also expressed a keen interest in developing a touring exhibition and catalogue following the project. We also aim to produce an illustrated and accessible book as further legacy of the project.","Through working with our partners, we will have access to and engagement with audiences across Scotland, from the Central Lowlands, the Northern and Western Isles, the Highlands to the east coast. Impact from the project will extend through our public engagement projects beyond museums and galleries to their audiences, substantially increasing access to collections. 1. The practical reminiscence sessions hosted by our partners will enhance public engagement with museum collections and generate new cultural knowledge. Thus, more regional public will learn about their social history through basketry, a fabric of society intimately bound up with their community's past skills and practices. They will also learn more about their local museum collection and its links with other museums at a national level. 2. These activities will develop new contexts for use of the collections through the local histories elicited in interaction with the public. Both 1&2 will enhance audience engagement and attendance. 3. We will develop understanding of and techniques for making significant, but no-longer made basket forms such as sculls, mudags and ciosans, extending this knowledge through our makers to curators, museums and their communities. 4. By updating the new material generated for museums with illustrated records, we will ensure enhancement of museum information and improve curatorial knowledge which will have benefit beyond the life of the project, while at the same time training a student for the future. 5. The NMoRL and Highland Folk Museum have collections from across Scotland. Collaborating on a national project will enhance communication between national and regional museums, developing regional knowledge exchange and enabling organizations to learn more about the extent and connections between their collections. 6. Our document for crafts educational policy on the value of craft practice for memory and design thinking will further extend impact through educational and craft networks. 7. All our partners encourage best use of their collections through public events, including study days and exhibitions. We will enhance impact by running a series of study days and an international symposium. These include one study day at NMoRL, Creating a Reminiscence Space, aimed at craft, educational and social history professionals, including the Scottish Vernacular Buildings Working Group, Scottish Working People's History Trust, and Social History Curators' Group. A second at the NMoRL, with demonstrations of materials and harvesting, will be open to the wider public. The international symposium, Basketry: Making, Memory, and Mind, at St Andrews will synthesize findings from the whole project, inviting national and international participants, including anthropologists, craft-and design-historians, ethno-botanists, social historians, art students, curators, craft experts, psychologists, policy makers and the general public. Each event will be advertised widely and open to the public, and we will ensure maximum audiences through the museums' publicity. 8. We also aim to curate a small exhibition of the project. At this stage we cannot commit to this taking place within the timeframe of the project. The National Museum, Shetland Museum and An Lanntair have expressed interest in this. 9. Our interactive website, which we will continue to update during the project, will further extend audiences. All partners will have links to the website. 10. We will produce an illustrated accessible volume, with input from our basket-makers and curatorial partners, on the social history of Scottish communities through baskets. 11. Each museum will have a much stronger, more accessible knowledge base for contextualisation and publicizing its collections to encourage new audiences to engage with them beyond the timespan of the project.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN007697%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This research will answer the following main question: what is the impact of e-legal deposit changes upon UK academic deposit libraries and their users? The project's principal contribution will be to provide a detailed account of the impact of e-legal deposit, applied to the specific case of academic deposit libraries. Legal deposit plays a significant role in ensuring the systematic preservation of the world's published written heritage. In the UK, it provides a regulatory framework for a trusted group of national and academic libraries to collect published textual materials in print form. The 2013 introduction of electronic legal deposit incorporated digital materials for the first time, taking steps to secure the UK's ""Digital Universe."" Despite this expansion, legal deposit is still conceived primarily as a way to preserve collections for the long term, with restrictions on how the materials can be used by contemporary researchers. However, published research into legal deposit often focuses on its regulatory and long-term preservation aspects. There is relatively little research into how e-legal deposit has affected the UK academic institutions tasked with enacting the regulations, or indeed their users. As a result, there is a need for user-focused research which explores how legal deposit collections are accessed and used, and to what extent these collections should support contemporary research in academic libraries. We will produce two case studies, in collaboration with two major libraries: The Bodleian Libraries, and the Cambridge University Library. We will focus on two specific groups which are directly affected by the outlined changes: academic libraries with regulatory responsibilities for legal deposit; and the academic and non-academic users of these libraries. While both groups have been the focus of discussion during the conception and implementation of e-legal deposit, this research will shed light on the wider social, cultural and institutional implications of the legislation. It will provide insights into how researchers in academia uses electronic legal deposit collections, and apply these to wider social and cultural issues including digital inclusion, information democratisation, and the role of libraries in addressing the digital divide in access to knowledge. In doing so, it will interrogate the benefits and challenges of legal deposit in the digital age, and will address the tension between a regulatory framework designed with long-term preservation in mind, and developments in academia and society which have made digital scholarship and digital inclusion vital for full participation in civic life. The project will engage with key figures involved in policymaking, implementation and collection development, as well as including the voices of contemporary users whose information behaviour incorporates these important collections. We will produce a series of journal articles and conference papers, provide a strong online presence for non-expert audiences, and engaged with users and creators of digital resources. The research will culminate in a white paper, to be presented a public symposium, providing a forum to build momentum for further research into the use of legal deposit collections. A central aim is to provide insights into how e-legal deposit in its current form interacts with emerging trends in digital scholarship and digital inclusion, and with existing library services. The UK is one of the nations leading the way in e-legal deposit, and this research has the potential to provide a vital and timely intervention for the international community as they face similar challenges. It will contribute not only to understanding and developing digital collections for academic deposit libraries, but also to international debates on the future of libraries in the digital age.","This study will benefit the following groups: the international library sector; users of academic libraries in the United Kingdom, including non-academic users who rely on academic libraries for physical and digital collections; and policymakers and strategic legal deposit role holders. They will benefit from direct involvement with the project, knowledge exchange at symposia and events, and access to project findings. UK deposit libraries will, for the first time, have access to a robust evaluation of the impact of e-legal deposit on their institutions and users. The following institutions will benefit directly as project partners: Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford; and Cambridge University Library. They jointly employ around 900 FTE staff, who will gain insights into the use of their collections, and benefit from knowledge exchange with academic researchers and the international library community. They will improve their knowledge of methods for undertaking impact assessment of their collections, and strengthen communication channels with their user community. This will lead to an increased ability for academic deposit libraries to serve their users more effectively through a deeper understanding of their needs and behaviours. It will also allow them to develop outreach activities which will expand long-term access to their collections. The international library community will benefit from the project's contribution to legal deposit best practice: they will receive access to the white paper, and a clear set of guidelines and recommendations for developing e-legal deposit collections. By addressing a hitherto neglected area of digital library practice, the project will hold global relevance for nations yet to implement similar regulations. The UK is one of few countries to implement e-legal deposit to date, and is unique among them because it involves academic libraries. This perspective will hold relevance for nations such as Sweden which are formally introducing e-legal deposit in coming years, and others such as the US and Australia which currently rely on informal agreements for electronic materials. While the scope of the project is specific and national, then, the findings have the potential to influence international debates on e-legal deposit implementation. Internal and external users of academic libraries will also benefit. These users are not solely drawn from the academic community: the Bodleian served around 31,000 external users in person in 2014, 40% of all its readers, while the Cambridge UL recorded 235,000 unique visitors to its free digital library. Both aim to increase participation by providing free digitised collections which are actively promoted through outreach activities, and reach audiences of hundreds of thousands. This project will therefore benefit current and future users of the partners' premises and digital collections. The long-term benefits to users could include improved collection development policies, recommendations for interface development, and addressing the limitations around access to e-legal deposit materials, which will improve library collections for users and widen participation.  There are associated benefits for individuals and groups involved in formulating legal deposit regulations, either in an advisory or advocacy capacity. The project will provide a timely opportunity to reflect on the impact of the 2013 legal deposit regulations, providing evidence for future consultations that could help such individuals to help shape policy. Our plan to work with the Joint Committee for Legal Deposit through our project partners will directly benefit areas of their remit, including: evaluating the effectiveness of non-print legal deposit regulations; and assessing the regulations in practice. We have recruited a broadly experienced steering group, which has overlap with the groups outlined above and will help to secure benefits for the major stakeholder communities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP005845%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Small islands present archaeologists with the opportunity to study the sustainability and resilience of complex socioecological systems over time. Do they lack socioecological resilience as argued by Petzold (2017) or Ellwood (1968) ""over one thousand people crowding on to Rathlin's flat windswept mass is almost an insult to nature"". This project will investigate and reveal the changing landscapes, environment and population history of 6 small islands around the Sea of Moyle over the last three millennia. Today the North Channel of the Irish Sea is seen as a remote and border zone between Scotland and Ireland. In the past this was not the case, and the Sea of Moyle or Sruth na Maoile (Scots Gaelic and Irish), was at various times a coherent and central geographic region crossed by sea voyagers as part of a sea-highway and linked by culture and kinship. The area was also a major gateway into Ireland and Scotland from the early Mesolithic to the post-Medieval Period. Following on from a pilot study on the island of Rathlin, this project will compare the archaeological and historical evidence of changing demography and environment between the islands (Rathlin, Tory, Arran, Islay, Gigha & Colonsay) that superficially share a common history of colonization, but are geographically and topographically diverse. There is also a wide variation in the archaeological information base from recent and high (Rathlin) to minimal/unknown (Gigha). All have evidence of being both occupied and defended within the Iron Age and all six saw the establishment of early Christian communities. At least 5 of the islands were within the Dalriada (Dál Riata) over-Kingdom in the 6th to early 7thC, and all were subject to early Viking Raids and then formed part of the Scandinavian Sudreyjar, or ""Southern Isles"" for the next 400 years. The later Medieval and post Medieval history of the islands is more complex and divergent but lastly all six islands saw major, if not remarkable, well-documented changes in population over the last 300 years. The size of these islands, and weather-related isolation, can exacerbate social and environmental shifts and one aim is to investigate whether the preceding environmental and economic history of the islands conditioned their response to external pressures such as new colonisers (the Vikings) or population changes (18th-19th C). These massive changes in population (1 to 66 persons km2) are well recorded by abandoned crofts, villages, field systems and even alien plant species which have recently been surveyed. We also have evidence from previous studies that least four of the six islands have high potential for environmental archaeology and particularly the utilization of lake sediments from lochs. Importantly all islands have had recent archaeological surveys or are undergoing current survey (Tory Island). The project will be the first to explicitly compare archaeological proxies from islands in the same region with archaeological and historical data. It will also trial some new techniques (sedaDNA and biomarkers) in a controlled archaeological setting where we have the optimum chance to verify data and avoid reinforcement syndrome. The islands offer the best potential we can have to test new population proxies including feacal sterols, diatom-derived phosphorous proxy as well as sedimentary C:N and stable isotope ratios. Chironomid-derived temperature reconstructions will provide the climatic background. This project will be the first to adopt a regional-scale approach to a past political entity designed to address these issues via a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach. We will integrate archaeological, palaeoenvironmental archives (including ancient DNA and biomarkers) in the search for the signature of colonization and human responses to environmental stresses in small island communities off the western Coast of Greater Britain.","Who will benefit: We have identified the following beneficiaries outside the academic community: 1) The island communities, of the 6 islands, 2 of which are owned by their inhabitants. All the islands are currently engaged in trying to diversify their economies through tourism and this project will feed directly to their island development committees, interest groups and websites which are listed in the Pathways to Impact document. The Argyll & Bute Council is also supporting the project as part of developing environmentally sound heritage-based tourism. The Council and local history groups will benefit greatly through support and assistance with landscape survey and documentary studies. 2) Archaeological and heritage management bodies, specifically; Historic Environment Scotland, the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities Northern Ireland, and the National Monuments Service Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Dublin who between them have statutory responsibility for the archaeological heritage protection on these islands. All 3 bodies support the project and have been in discussion with the PI (Rebecca Jones, Ian Greenway and Michael MacDonagh respectively). 3) General public and visitors to the island interpretation and history centers. All 6 islands have visitor centers and this project will work in tandem with all of them. How will they benefit: 1. Contribution to the local committees that manage the islands via the provision of data and analyses of landscape change and interpretations of variations in landscape resilience over the last three millennia. The islands will benefit through increased knowledge, and the opportunity to kindle renewed visitor interest in the development of the surrounding landscapes. These islands are seen to be of high cultural value way beyond their size and are of great interest to the public not just in the UK but worldwide (e.g Holy Island etc.). The islander's interest is apparent when we have given public lectures on our pilot research on the island of Rathlin. The Rathlin Development & Community Association (RDCA) has a keen interest to be involved in this scientific research and will liaise between the research team and interested members of the island community. RDCA will organise public lectures and drop-in sessions where islanders can help the research team to map the 19th century boom and decline in island population.  2. Historic Environment Scotland and Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities Northern Ireland and the National Monuments Service Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Dublin will be provided with the results of the project and thereby a framework for investigating and understanding the long-term development of island landscapes (see letters of support). 3. This project will inform the public about the shared history, cultural and landscapes either side of the Irish Sea through a combination of history and science. 4. The wider public will also be informed via popular organisations and magazines (Archaeology Scotland, Irish Archaeology etc.) 5. Training a new generation of archaeologists: The project will provide high-level training for 3 ECRs (in combining science & archaeology) & by broadening the research experience of the PI and the CIs.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR012857%2F1

The primary source material for the project is the dance Harmonica Breakdown (1938) choreographed by Jane Dudley. Dudley was for many years a member of the Martha Graham Dance Company before becoming Director of Contemporary Dance at the London Contemporary Dance School in 1970.  Recognised for her choreography that 'fuses politics and modern dance', Harmonica Breakdown (1938) is one of Dudley's most notable works. Accompanied by a harmonica blues score by musician Sonny Terry, the dance takes as its subject matter the 'struggles of African American workers during the Dust Bowl'. According to Dudley, Harmonica Breakdown is 'a dance of misery-and defiance rising out of it'. Sheron Wray was for many years a member of London Contemporary Dance Theatre and worked closely with Dudley. Dudley set the dance on Wray and bequeathed it to Wray on her death. Wray continues to stage the dance around the world. The Harmonica Breakdown was filmed by Darshan Singh Bhuller (Dance Film, 1995) as part of an Arts Council film project (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybvHgFUCuPo); it has, however, yet to be examined through movement notation or mapped via current digital technologies. This project aims to record the dance in these technologies, to investigate questions related to motion capture typical of each system, and examine how these technologies compliment each other.  Finally, we intend to produce a dynamic chorographic score that combines motion capture data, LMA scores, and oral/physical transmission of the dance by Wray.","Our project intends to discover the extent to which traditional Laban Movement Analysis can be supplemented by digital movement capture to help learners embody movement. Almost any field of human activity requiring detailed examination of the manner in which the human body travels through space could provide useful material for our study. But we have chosen dance (over sport) because it will provide us with an end product both illustrative of technique and enjoyable to see. Dance is the ideal vehicle for communicating our findings beyond the usual academic circles. It also provides a process that is accessible at any stage of its development.  We plan to use various methods (e-flyers, workshops, etc.) to maintain awareness of our progress among identified audience of interested parties, with results examined at ICKL, 2017. At each stage we will show how what we are learning is of benefit to a broad range of movement-oriented parties from physiotherapists to ten pin bowlers.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM010279%2F1

Clearer knowledge is an essential prerequisite for comprehending both its role within the Roman world and its transformation into a new centre of power in the post-Roman period. This project, created in consultation with local organizations and official bodies interested in the archaeology of Roman York will capitalise on the results of past research to build a new foundation for future exploration and public presentation. This is particularly timely given current plans for enhancing existing museum displays and the development of a new Roman visitor centre in the city. York exemplifies a general challenge in urban archaeology - how to integrate fragmentary excavated evidence to understand complete town plans. This project offers a new integrated approach, combining evidence from past excavations and museum archives with the results of new Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys as well as a newly enhanced subsurface deposit model, to provide a new synthesis of the development of Roman York and its environs. The GPR work will include surveys of present day streets as well as larger open areas within the City. The study of the archives will be completed in co-operation with the York Archaeological Trust (YAT) and the York Museums Trust (YMT). All project outputs will contribute to an upgrading of the City of York Council's Historic Environment Record (HER) and will be used to inform new museum and visitor centre displays planned by YMT and YAT.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV015338%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Interdisciplinarity, particularly between the arts and the sciences, is notoriosly difficult to achieve. This project takes one particular historical case study in order to understand disciplinary difference at a crucial moment in the past. Oliver Lodge (1851-1940) was a key figure in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century culture. Today, however, he remains relatively neglected, largely because of the apparent contradictions between different aspects of his career. This research network uses these contradictions as a starting point to consider the role of the disciplines in shaping knowledge. Taking Lodge as a case study allows us to understand the place of science in his period and to learn how disciplinary boundaries continue to structure research and knowledge today.  Lodge has much to teach us about the place of science in culture because, in his life and career, he transcended many of the boundaries we imagine structure the cultural status of science. A pioneer of wireless telegraphy, Lodge was an internationally-acclaimed physicist and engineer, equally at home in laboratory and workshop. Alongside his commercial interests Lodge carved out a career in the new Victorian universities, becoming the first professor of physics at the University of Liverpool and then Principal of the University of Birmingham after its move to Edgbaston. Not only did Lodge help science consolidate its place at the heart of the university, but he also saw the institutionalisation of the differences between scientific disciplines. A prolific writer, speaker and, later in his life, broadcaster, Lodge was widely known as a populariser of science and commentator on current affairs. Yet in the latter part of his life, Lodge became a famous spiritualist, carrying out psychical investigations alongside his scientific research and publishing a besteller, Raymond (1916), detailing encounters with his son killed in the trenches. Focusing on Lodge can help us understand the differences between science and the arts and humanities; the place of faith and the imagination in scientific practice; and the role of the arts and humanities in popularising science.   To understand a career such as Lodge's, it is necessary to take an interdsciplinary approach. The project is designed to bring together a range of scholars, archivists and museum professionals at four workshops, each focusing on a particular aspect of Lodge's career. The first will consider the place of science in the new Victorian universities; the second the many ways that signalling though space was understood in the period; the third Lodge's physics and engineering and the supposed differences between pure and applied science; the fourth scientific lives more generally, investigating different tools and methodological approaches for the study of historical scientific figures. The project will maintain a blog, enabling conversation to continue between workshops and extend the network beyond the immediate participants; it will include a public demonstration of Victorian popular science, exploring the way in which scientific ideas were communicated in the past; lastly, it will publish an edited collection, producing the first scholarly book on Lodge to bring together the various aspects of his life and career.    In 1913 Lodge gave the Presidential Address at the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Birmingham. Lodge's talk was on the continuity of the physical universe in the face of relativity, but Lodge - physicist and engineer; scientist and spiritualist; entrepreneur and civic leader - was himself an exemplary demonstration of continuity. A century later, this research network will reappraise Lodge's career, tracing the connections that structured scientific practice over Lodge's lifetime and so learning how the disciplines might be restructured today.","The project is designed to reach partners beyond the academy while also engaging the wider public. It will have impact on the following groups: Museum professionals. John Liffen, Curator of Communications at the Science Museum, will be part of the advisory board and participate in the workshops. The impact on heritage professionals will be in the form of knowledge exchange between the staff of the Museum and scholars from all the disciplines involved in the project. The project will lead to increased use of the Museum's collections, this research adding value to the services the Museum porvides. Working with the project will impact on the Museum's interpretation strategy, particularly with regards to the new communication galleries opening in 2014 which feature Lodge. Therefore, the project will ultimately have an impact on the Science Museum's visitors (currently around 3 million a year).   Archivists. The impact on archivists will also be in the form of knowledge exchange between archivists and scholars from various disciplines. Archivists at the Universities of Birmingham and Liverpool will be involved in their respective workshops, allowing them to benefit from the expertise of scholars who will in turn benefit from improved knowledge of collections. The project will also include archivists from the Institute of Engineering and Technology. Participation in the Lodge project will help archivists consider Lodge's relevance, and ways in which collections might be used in their outreach activity, by scholars, and the wider public.   Public lectures. Public lectures are planned in Liverpool and Birmingham, the two universities with which Lodge was connected, so that the project can have a direct impact on members of the public. The lectures will highlight Lodge's role in the history of each city, and place his scientific achievement in the context of his civic life. Each lecture will help the wider public engage with the key argument of the project, using Lodge to understand the place of science in culture.  Exhibition. The Cadbury Research Library at the University of Birmingham will curate and host an exhibition on Lodge, drawing on the University's archival material and its collection of historical physics instruments. This activity will lead to knowledge exchange between archivists and scholars and will raise the profile of the University's collections amongst visitors. Although the exhibition will be installed on campus, it will be promoted as part of the University's programme of knowledge exchange.   Popularisation project. Lodge was an important populariser of science. This project will stage a recreation of a Victorian electrical demonstration. The impact on the audience will be fourfold: it will engage them with questions about the role of science in the imagined futures of the Victorians; it will encourage them to reflect on whether those futures came to pass; it will make them consider the roles of science and technology in creating our own futures; and lastly, it will alert them to the ways science is communicated, both in the present and the past. It will also have an impact through the science that it communicates to the audience. Participants will consider the value of recreations and performance as a means of communicating science. Blog. This will have an impact on the public by providing an accessible commentary on the project. It will be fully embedded within social media, extending the reach of the project beyond the academy. The blog will be edited with a broad audience in mind, contextualising workshop material accordingly. The blog will link the project to previous work on Lodge, especially the previous conference in 1994. By publishing video of this conference (there were talks by Lodge's grandsons), the impact of this earlier activity can be extended while providing an immediate context for the current Lodge project.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK006223%2F1

Yet the precise practices, relationships, and goals involved in acquiring and organizing these works, including the changes brought by the arrival of printing, remain significantly understuded. They can be best understood by detailed examination of specific collections and collectors. This project focuses on the library of one remarkably active and effective collector, Guillaume Pellicier (ca. 1490-1567), a French bishop and ambassador of François Ier to Venice. It will produce a detailed description of the collection (which is today held for the most part at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin), the digitisation of its contents, and a detailed study of the history of the transmission of Greek culture in sixteenth-century Venice and of private and public libraries in the Renaissance. The project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the ways in which books were produced and circulated, and of the role played by the second and third generation of Greeks settled in Italy in the transmission of the Greek cultural patrimony to modern Europe. The investigation and analysis of this corpus will offer new views on the survival of manuscript production in the age of printing, an aspect of book production that is under-represented in academic research and underestimated in global studies of written culture.  This project will make the library accessible to researchers and the general public alike and will provide tools for the conservation, protection and promotion of the collection as a prime example of the cultural and intellectual heritage of Europe. It also aims to offer the general public a better understanding of cultural life in Venice and of the cultural policy of King François Ier, particularly in regard to Greek culture. The project will be led by Raphaële Mouren (London; PI). Her expertise in the history of scholarship and the transmission of Greek literature in 16th c. Italy will be key to the project as will her command of the norms and formats of manuscript description and critical edition archival documentation. The Co-investigator will be Rosa Maria Piccione, a classicist and a specialist in the transmission of Greek culture and manuscript production and in sixteenth century Venice. Two postdoctoral researchers will support the project, working on the manuscript catalogue. A consultant on a short contract will help us investigate archives in France and Italy. Richard Gartner, a specialist in metadata and digital libraries, will design the structure for the dataset in XML (TEI, METS) and CIDOC-CROM. An international advisory board will provide additional expertise in the key areas of palaeography, manuscript studies, the history of libraries and digital humanities. The project is supported, both financially and in-kind, by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin. The project will expand our knowledge of manuscript production in the age of printing and the creation of libraries in sixteenth-century France and Italy. It will make available hidden material that might support PhD theses and wider scholarship in the field; it will be of value to the work of librarians and metadata specialists; it will create a significant corpus of data and metadata in a variety of interoperable formats for reuse and sharing and will generate a range of publications in several disciplines. Its outputs will be of interest to a large range of non-academic professional audiences as well as the general public.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW009587%2F1

We will work in places that are highly vulnerable to compounded recovery challenges in the shadow of the pandemic - not solely because of disease impacts, but because its wider social implications intersect with multiple, ongoing risks associated with ethnic marginalisation, conflict, poverty, displacement, environmental degradation and natural hazards.   Our main research emphasis is on the narratives of recovery created by and for such communities. We seek to understand what is highlighted and neglected within public discourse on the needs of marginalised communities, and what these communities themselves value and prioritise in light of their lived experiences. But our proposal goes much further than posing research questions, and will be rooted in participation and action, using creative arts approaches to strengthen people's articulation of rights and needs during and after the pandemic. Our phased research and impact activities aim at strengthening local networks and supporting the existing capacities communities have to voice their concerns, challenge prejudices and realign recovery priorities.   We will work principally in Brazil, Colombia and Peru where we propose two scales of work: macro-scale research across case study territories using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods; and a series of micro-scale studies with specific communities on the ground, based strongly on ethnographic and participatory research approaches. This will be complemented with international scale work, integrating the research findings with wider studies of inequality, participation, wellbeing, intersecting risk and pandemic recovery in Latin America and globally. The proposal spans four key challenges identified in the RRR Call, and closely matches priorities 5.1 and 5.3 in the 'UN research roadmap for the COVID-19 recovery'. It builds directly from our recent work on trajectories and representations of disaster recovery and interlinks with the ongoing collaborative research and action activities generated by each of the partners with marginalised communities.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX001733%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project (a partnership between the University of Nottingham, Jam Creative Studios and the Norfolk Archaeological Trust) will use the site of the Roman town of Venta Icenorum (Norfolk) to develop and evaluate new methods of site interpretation through the use of an immersive virtual reality experience. As a Roman town that did not see subsequent development in the medieval and later periods, Venta Icenorum is one of the UK's most significant archaeological sites and has been the subject of a major programme of geophysical survey and excavation by the University of Nottingham since 2006. In common with many archaeological sites, there are few visible remains at Venta and the site has limited infrastructure for visitors. A new site interpretation scheme created by the applicants in 2015 used a 3D reconstruction of the site viewed using an app for Android and Apple mobile devices and containing an Augmented Reality (AR) element that allowed users to view the ancient town against the present landscape. The 2015 AR model was the latest iteration of a long history of visualisation at Venta that started with painted reconstructions and moved on to a series of 3D reconstructions. All of these, however, were passive encounters for the viewer presenting a single interpretation of the site. The new project will create a more dynamic immersive experience in which the visitor will use their mobile device to interact with characters and animals within the town and experience the town in different weather and seasons. In this pilot project, the visitor will take a route from the South Gate to the forum of the Roman town and will be guided by one of the town's Roman residents in animated form who will show them points of interest. Their progress will trigger a series of events and interactions with other characters and animals and the user will hear the ambient sounds and speech of a town in Roman Britain and will see the sunlit town of previous reconstructions transformed into a winter townscape of mud, snow and smoke.  In order to achieve the new project will address a series of technical challenges relating to the use of location-based AR in a fairly featureless landscape with variable GPS coverage by combining existing locational techniques with new markerless AR technologies with the aim of piloting scalable and transferable methods for delivering immersive experiences within open landscapes It will also evaluate the issue of optimizing VR and AR experiences to operate and be sustainable in a world of rapidly developing rival platforms and for on-site and off-site use. Using fully immersive VR on the site itself remains impractical for safety reasons but the rapid rise in affordable fully immersive VR technologies for use at home and in education means that potentially costly VR/AR models need to envisage multiple applications. The project will also address the interpretative challenges raised by creating speech, dress and physical appearance for a population known only from archaeological evidence. A process of evaluation will rigorously evaluate audience responses to this new experience to inform its future development. Finally the project will further develop the existing partnership between the University of Nottingham, Jam Creative Studio (who are pioneering innovative approaches to heritage interpretation using new technologies) and the Norfolk Archaeological Trust (who own and manage a range of heritage sites across Norfolk).","By trialling immersive experience at Venta Icenorum and evaluating visitor responses to it, this project will have actual and potential benefits for a range of stakeholders. Heritage organisations - the project addresses the needs of those engaged in heritage management and interpretation, particularly in the presentation of heritage in a landscape setting. Such organisations are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by immersive technologies that allow the hidden assets and stories of sites to be brought to the public in ways that are exciting and innovative and that change the visitor from passive observer to active participant. At Venta this is particularly relevant to the Norfolk Archaeological Trust (NAT) who are facilitating our project and who own a range of sites (including Tasborough Fort, Warham Camp and Burgh Castle) that share similar challenges to audience engagement as Venta. These include an absence of museum buildings and infrastructure such as mains power, intermittent or variable mobile coverage and heritage assets that are largely buried or intangible despite being of national or international significance. The project proposed here will be of immediate regional relevance in exploring the potential for AR and VR technologies in relation to the NAT and it's other properties, but will also help demonstrate the possibilities afforded by immersive technologies to other heritage organisations and practitioners in the UK and internationally. By improving the interpretation and public understanding of sites, heritage organisations can better persuade policy makers and the public that such assets require preservation and investment in the face of pressures on land-use and financial resources. Immersive tech sector - the project results will be of clear importance to others working in the field of location-based AR and immersive experiences, providing evidence of audience response to such technologies and demonstrating additional ways in which such technologies can be used beyond their obvious value as a means of entertainment. As noted in the Technical Plan, the project team will document the approach taken to developing and evaluating the mobile app, and will release this as an open access case study for others undertaking similar digital output-focused projects. Heritage audiences and site visitors - the project aims to improve the visitor experience of heritage sites both as an on-site visitor and as a remote visitor. Members of the public who engage with heritage as a leisure activity are ultimately the largest potential group to benefit from the project as it strives to improve the experience of using new technologies in the context of heritage visiting. Members of the public who cannot for whatever reason access heritage sites will have greater equality of access to sites enabled by immersive technologies and, as a consequence, to the informal learning and shared cultural experience that comes as a result of visiting. Education sector (primary, secondary and tertiary) - the project will provide remote and on-site AR/VR experiences of the Roman town that can be adapted for different pedagogical levels ranging from stimulating interest in Key Stage 2 pupils to university seminar groups exploring issues of language and identity in relation to the different characters employed. VR platforms such as Oculus Rift are increasingly utilised in schools and colleges, while the ubiquity of gaming and mobile technology means that most people under 30 are increasingly comfortable with accessing information through such means. In addition the results of the project and its digital outputs will be used within the major schools and museums outreach programme of the ERC Latin Now project with which we are collaborating on the character dialogue (see Letter of Support).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR009953%2F1

By investing in two immersive experience systems ('IESs') - one for visitor experiences and one for training - and the equipment to enable us to use them effectively, we will move from offering experiences and learning methods that can only engage a single visitor or learner at once, to being able to engage multiple individuals using virtual reality (VR). The AHRC's investment will allow us to undertake product design and testing, so that our 3D digital documentation and digital experience research can directly feed into practical impact. Accessibility is the fundamental theme across this investment, with the new equipment allowing us to cater to more people, including those with additional access needs.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX010104%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The Hispanic and Anglo worlds are often portrayed as the Cain and Abel of the Western culture, antagonistic and alien to each other. This project will challenge this view by developing a new critical conceptual framework - the 'Hispanic-Anglosphere' - to study individuals, networks and communities that made of the British Isles a crucial hub for the global Hispanic world and a bridge between Spanish Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas during the late eighteenth to early twentieth centuries, a period marked by the dislocation of global polities, nation-state building and the rise of nationalism.   Direct contact between women and men of the British Isles and those of the Spanish-speaking world increased exponentially from the 1760s. Trade between Britain and Spanish America rose by about 300 to 400 per cent long before South American independence in the 1820s. A good number of companies involved in this trade had branches in different locations of the British Isles, the Americas, the Philippines, in the Canary Islands, and were run by English, Scottish and Irish families based in Spain. Contact further increased in the 1780s with the arrival to these shores of Spanish American revolutionaries. The Napoleonic wars not only took tens of thousands of Britons to fight in Iberia, also encouraged a few to join regular e irregular forces in Spain and later in Spanish America, thus starting a trend of British personal involvement in Hispanic conflicts long before the International Brigades made its name in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). Many of these expats either died or decided to settle abroad. A few returned home, bringing wives and children, as well as foreign goods, manners and customs which they helped to popularize. Similarly, hundreds of Spanish refugees flocked to the British Isles after the restoration of Bourbon absolutism in 1814, often crossing paths with Spanish American leaders in search for assistance in the delicate business of new-nation state building. Scholars have studied some of these cases, but mainly from national perspectives or in terms of either 'Spanish-British' or 'Latin American-British' relations, often reducing the British experience to the confines of London, thus leaving little room for the study of persons, issues and undertakings that operated in wider areas and both through and beyond national and regional boundaries.  In this project, historians from the UK, Ireland, continental Europe, the Americas and Russia, jointly with scholars from other disciplines and non-academic partners, will study those people who in the British Isles were closely engaged with the Hispanic world, regardless of their birth, religion or political allegiance as well as of those who came from the Hispanic world to any point of the British Isles as visitors, exiles and/or migrants. A key question to be addressed is how these individuals and networks worked with and/or counteracted growing restrictions imposed on the movement of people, ideas, goods and capital.   The network will work in partnership with the National Trust Tyntesfield, the stately home founded by the Madrid-born merchant William Gibbs who built much of his fortune on the importation of Spanish wine and Peruvian guano. Scholarly discussions will be held in the context of the estate's rich collection of material culture with the intention of contributing to improving and extending their interpretation. The project will operate through an online interactive platform that will serve to host scholars' exchanges and to showcase peer-reviewed material generated as a result of the networks' research such as working papers and an online exhibition. Two three-day workshops are planned to take place in Winchester and in NT Tyntesfield. Expert knowledge will be tested and disseminated through discrete scheduled meetings with the general public and through mass and social media, thus encouraging dialogue with wider audiences outside academic circles.","The network aims to widen and deepen public understandings of the Hispanic-Anglosphere early on in the project by seeking public participation in discussions relating to the use of this term as a new critical conceptual framework for the study of the individuals, networks and communities who made of a British Isles a hub for the global Hispanic world in a period of intense social, cultural and political change (late eighteenth to early twentieth centuries).  It is also hoped that discussions may inform public policy-making in relation to wider topics of increasing political, economic and socio-cultural salience such as social integration, diasporas, the dislocation of global and supranational polities, globalization, nation-building and inter-imperiality by establishing connections between academia, governmental and non-governmental organizations and the public at large.  In this respect, our partnership with the National Trust Tyntesfield is of pivotal importance. During two planned workshops, expert knowledge will be tested and disseminated through discrete scheduled meetings of scholars with the general public and through mass and social media, thus encouraging dialogue with wider audiences outside academic circles. Questions from the public will be either answered on the spot or collected to inform further academic research. This session may be broadcasted through the network's online presence (ex. Webinar) and/or radio and TV stations. Selected extracts will be recorded and disseminated as podcasts through the network's website. Throughout the project, network members will be encouraged to post archival and visual findings, to blog and to use Twitter (using a hashtag that will be common across the two workshops) to raise awareness of our work.   Network members from different disciplines will be asked to engage directly with the National Trust-Tyntesfield's rich collection relating to the Hispanic-Anglosphere (printed, visual and material culture) with a view to produce interpretations that will be showcased on the network's own website as well as in the NT Tyntesfield's webpages which have over a million annual visitors and reach a vast, national and international readership. Material from case studies may be incorporated into learning activities, such as field trips, designed for students at various educational levels.   The network's own website will provide a forum for academic and non-academic discussions as well as host peer-reviewed working papers, an online exhibition and thematic and prosopographical webpages under open access criteria. Findings may also contribute to the updating and enrichment of existing digital scholarly resources which may already offer material relevant to the Hispanic-Anglosphere. Impact in this area will be measured through quantification of specific online hits, downloads and meaningful comments posted online.   The involvement of curators and researchers based at other heritage institutions means that a fresh historical perspective will be extended and deployed in a variety of disciplinary and institutional contexts in matters relating to the interaction of the Bristish Isles with the global Hispanic world.  While seeking the cooperation of selected mass media outlets for engaging the general public in the project, the network will endeavour to build with them a creative relationship that may result in the production of one or more relevant radio programmes and/or TV documentaries based around the concept of the Hispanic-Anglosphere and/or case-studies from a projected multi-authored book.  Impact will be also measured through custom-made feedback forms (online and in paper) during and after workshops, correspondence with non-academic institutions and record of instances of significant presence of the project in mass media outputs (ex. newspaper articles, radio interviews, etc.).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR002681%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will study a small constellation of important literary and cultural magazines from three countries (Britain, France, Germany) in order to consider how, through translation, they explore and construct notions of European identity in the period following from the end of World War Two to the mid-1960s. Rapid shifts towards decolonisation, the Americanisation of European culture, the rise of anti-militarism and the strategic and ideological conflicts instigated by the Cold War all stimulated an ongoing reassessment of what the European idea stood for and whether or how it might be achieved. Using the notion of periodicals as 'European spaces' (Brolsma and Wijnterp, 2018) the project addresses the following research question: how does periodical culture in Britain, France, and Germany use translation to reconfigure a vision for Europe after the catastrophe of World War Two?  At the heart of the project lies a focus on the practice of translation as carried out in the magazines under consideration: what is the significance of the translation of works of poetry, fiction, criticism, and non-fiction in our corpus in this period? How do translated texts operate as vehicles for the forging of new European identities? Does the crossing of linguistic boundaries produce alliances across national borders? Conversely, in the practice of non-translation do we see a new assertion of national languages and identities? Do bilingual magazines in this period (e.g. Two Cities, Adam, The Gate/Das Tor) work to bring diverse national literatures together, or mark their continued divergence? So far, little research has examined how literary and cultural journals responded to these turbulent post-war years by acting as a platform for intellectuals to promote their visions of Europe, forging transnational networks and being actively internationalist in their cultural commitments. We will mount a range of events to explore these questions, including workshops, an international conference, a public-facing exhibition, and a website with translated materials from the magazines studied. In addition we will also publish a number of articles and a co-edited book of essays to reflect the work of the project.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV002694%2F1

The NME Network ran from September 2016 to September 2017, bringing together academics, publishers, editors and artists engaged with or with an interest in the scholarly editing of the modernist text. The specific concerns of the NME can be grouped under two headings:  a) technological and practical: the effect of the rapid change, development and innovation in print technologies during the period in which these texts were being produced, alongside writer's unprecedented embracing of the process of revision in this period. b) aesthetic and cultural: the particular characteristics of fluidity and uncertainty permeating modernist aesthetics, the centrality of the relationship between the verbal and visual in the modernist period, and the breadth of allusion characteristic of many modernist texts. Our non-academic members noted that these issues and arising discussions had significant implications for numerous non-academic creative practitioners and professionals; and that creative artists, writers, editors, proofreaders, printmakers, publishers would benefit from the opportunity to come together in groups to explore these scholarly and creative issues in hands-on ways, to maximise knowledge exchange and skills enhancement. Such opportunities were seen as particularly important because, although many individuals work across a number of creative or professional fields, there are limited opportunities available for them to meet others with similarly broad fields of activity. The outputs of the NME, including a digital edition of a short fiction by Virginia Woolf and summaries of the discussions held at the Network events posted on the NME website, capture some of the possible approaches to the challenge of editing a modernist text. The work of the NME has already had significant impact across the academic community in the field of modernism; this follow-on funding will extend and expand the impact of the project into various non-academic or academic-associated fields. The six events which form the project have been designed in collaboration with project partners from a range of professional and creative fields to ensure we engage a wide range of potential beneficiaries. They are also informed by our non-academic members' very positive responses to the NME's open and discursive workshop model. All events will focus around a selection of modernist texts of particular interest from an editing perspective, ranging across genres and styles, and from across the modernist period. The centrepiece activity will be an exhibition of works to be held at Shandy Hall. We will issue a call for proposals to make creative work responding to any or all of these texts, in the context of the findings arising from the work of the NME. Leading up to this exhibition we will host five workshops: 1) modernist print technologies 2) the book as physical object of social and cultural exchange 3) pochoir printmaking technique and the text/image relationship 4) languages of editing, and 5) curating the verbal and the visual (responding to the exhibition of works). These will be run by experts drawn from our project partners including artists, social enterprise leaders, editors, publishers, curators and academics. Collectively, these events will bring the insights of the NME - the questions raised by the activity of editing a modernist text for the twenty-first century as much as the conclusions drawn - into productive dialogue with those involved in text-based work across a wide range of creative and professional fields, at a moment when reflecting on the particular qualities of the modernist text is of increasing interest to a post-postmodern generation of creative artists, writers, designers, and publishing and editorial professionals.","The project's impact agenda is driven by the conversations initiated by the artist and editor members of the NME Network about the potential benefit of bringing the Network's activities and outputs to a wider non-academic audience. This suggestion was confirmed when we used their networks to contact editors, publishers, social enterprises, art galleries and curators who were keen to enter into partnership with us in developing this project, which will benefit a range of intersecting communities: Creative artists, designers and writers: Our call for proposals will expose creative practitioners to the work of the NME, providing information about the modernist texts selected for response and about approaches to editing explored by the NME, in addition to providing an opportunity for selected emerging and established artists to have their work exhibited. The hands-on workshops on print technologies and pochoir technique, delivered by experts in the field, will enable creative professionals and interested amateurs to acquire and hone specialist skills as well as understanding their historical and cultural context. Writers, editors and proofreaders: The workshops on print technologies, languages of editing, and curating the verbal and the visual will be of particular benefit to writers, independent editors and proofreaders. The languages of editing workshop has been designed in response to a need identified by our project partner Corridor8 among the freelance editors and writers they use, and combines providing information about the historical context of the modernist journal with practical approaches to editing historical and contemporary avant-garde texts, as well as the development and use of modern editorial markup languages. The workshop on curating will enable editors and proofreaders to consider how they work with material texts in dialogue with visual and fine art. Independent publishers: The workshop on languages of editing will be of particular benefit to independent publishers. The call for proposals is also likely to attract text-based works which may be of interest to independent publishers. Curators: The workshop on curating will address the specific challenges faced by curators of exhibitions including verbal and visual materials in a practical way - emerging from, though not limited to, the historical and aesthetic context of modernism. The Shandy Hall exhibition gives a clear practical focus to the workshop. The third sector and public sector: The proposed activities bring together creative practitioners, professionals and members of the public to investigate issues emerging from cutting-edge scholarly activity on editing the modernist text. Our project partners are the Laurence Sterne Trust at Shandy Hall, a charitable trust; MyBookcase, a social enterprise whose founder is also a sculptor; and Corridor8, a not-for-profit publishing platform. Each partner has enthusiastically identified the potential benefits of the project to their target audience, and has worked closely with the PI and CoIs to shape the activities so as to maximise the accessibility and value of each to their non-academic networks. MyBookcase and Corridor8 have also explicitly identified the benefits to their own organisation of a) an increased knowledge and understanding of the practical activities of the scholarly editor of the modernist text in particular, and b) a deeper understanding of the material contexts in which modernist texts were produced. Each has well-established networks and contacts across a range of beneficiary constituencies, and therefore collectively bring expertise in reaching and engaging these constituencies. General public: Participants in all events may be drawn from the general public. Our project partners' networks will be crucial in targeting our publicity at individuals with an interest in editing and editorial practices, modernist aesthetics, book history and the book form, or twentieth-century printmaking.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT001461%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The question - whether we should think of the world as consisting of entities statically defined by essential properties (i.e. in philosophical jargon, ""substances""), or as processes, that undergo and persist precisely because of change - is a fundamental metaphysical dichotomy, debated since the pre-Socratics. Since the rise of atomism in the seventeenth century the substance view has dominated scientifically grounded philosophy. John Dupré's ERC-funded project, A Process Ontology for Contemporary Biology, develops the thesis that for biology, at least, this has been a profound mistake (Dupré 2012: Nicholson and Dupré, in press). Dupré argues that living systems are always dynamic at multiple spatial and temporal scales and their persistence, far from being merely the continued possession of essential properties, is the result of the finely articulated interplay of multiple processes. Visual representation is essential both to the practice and the communication of science. However, whereas drawing in the past played a central role in fields such as morphology and embryology, the rise of photographic and digital technologies and the growing emphasis on molecules as opposed to whole organisms have increasingly marginalized drawing practices. A serious problem faced in the development of a fully processual biology is that most visual representation strongly suggests a realm of static things. For example, the presentation of an organism will be of a particular developmental 'stage', typically the mature adult, which confounds the fact that this is a momentary temporal stage of the developmental process. Even where representation of something as plainly dynamic as metabolism, for example, will include arrows representing time, the natural reading will be of transitions between a fixed array of things (instances of chemical kinds). Moreover, while visual images or 'visual explanations' (Tufte 1997) in science depend on a variety of graphic devices ranging from the use of video, and photography to the use of computational graphic software, simulation and hand-drawing, these means of making images largely depend on mechanistic models (for, or of, their objects) which are already intertwined with their methods of production.  The decline of drawing in scientific practice is epitomised by Wakefield's research field, cell division and mitosis. Whereas 20 years ago, as a PhD student, his learning was centred around direct participation, through microscope-based observation and drawing of cells, his own PhD students are now further removed, watching 2D representations of cells on computer screens and printing out screen-shots. For the last 5 years, his interest in this distinction has grown, leading to an exploratory collaboration with the PI and, through this application, the Co-I. Anderson's work over a number of years has highlighted the epistemic costs of the decline of graphic skills in the Life Sciences. She has researched the ways in which scientists have used drawing as a way of developing deep insights into their subject matters, and in her own practice, under the rubric of 'Isomorphology', she has developed classificatory methods that highlight formal parallels cutting across the traditional boundaries of animal, mineral and vegetable. This work has been carried out in collaboration with a variety of scientists and museum curators and has resulted in residencies, exhibitions, talks and workshops.Building on the Isomorphology project, her more recent work, guided in part by extensive discussions with Dupré, has begun to explore ways of representing biological process, under the new rubric of Isomorphogenesis.  In line with the growing interest in process-centred understandings of biology, the present project will address the need for novel image-making practices to provide more intuitively dynamic representations of living systems through an innovative collaboration between art, biology and philosophy.","This project will generate impact under the following 4 strands: (i) to increase the appreciation of the value of drawing - as a way of knowing (rather than illustrating) - for a diverse range of people beyond the scientific community  (ii) to raise awareness about the shift from an object/static view of biology to a processual view of biology through an arts-based approach  (iii) to break down barriers between scientific and artistic communities (iv) to offer both practitioners and institutions a new model of practice for interdisciplinary collaboration and engagement.  Through a collaborative approach and interactive impact activities, the project will instigate a multi-directional engagement between biology, philosophy and art, whilst promoting a wider understanding of the role of drawing in science within 'mainstream' society. To this end we will engage individuals from diverse backgrounds and institutions through organising interactive workshops, exhibitions, website forums and blog posts.  Target audiences: 1.BA and MA level Art students at Falmouth University, the Royal College of Art and University College London: As current Art Education does not integrate scientific language or practice into BA and MA courses, Art students do not have the opportunity to engage with contemporary science or the confidence to explore potential art/science collaborations. By running drawing workshops in arts colleges with collaborating biologists Wakefield (Exeter) and Olson (NHM), we will encourage artists to explore new possibilities for engaging with science. The workshops will introduce artists to scientific knowledge and methods that can be developed further in individual artistic work, in an interdisciplinary approach. By bringing philosophy of science and life sciences to the attention of artists we aim to foster an appreciation of science as a source for artistic inspiration. Finally, this interaction with scientists will stimulate new art/science dialogues, and suggest ways in which artists can reach out to scientists (and vice-versa), and therefore potentially broaden their career paths.  2. Institutions: Both cultural and scientific research institutions - including museums - pursue a public engagement agenda, which capitalizes on the innovative nature of art/science collaborations and their potential to convey both scientific and artistic ideas to a wider audience. With interdisciplinary collaboration at its core, and supported by original artwork co-created with scientists, this project will pave the way for, and promote, new forms of engagement and opportunities for inter-institutional encounters. An important aim is to foster new interdisciplinary links between visual arts, philosophy, and biology. By breaking down barriers between scientific and artistic communities the project will contribute to the 'science in culture' AHRC theme.  3. General Public: Our impact activities aim to attract the general public to the sciences through the visual arts. In particular the art work generated aims to draw attention to an understanding of 'process biology'. Deeper reflection on the dynamic nature of life should provide better understandings of such crucial human experiences as ageing or cancer and also provide richer experiences of nature, seen as a temporary and evolving whole. All exhibitions will be open to the public, and cultivate an appreciation of the value of drawing for conveying insights and understanding in both scientific and artistic research. Collaborating scientists will contribute captions (in accessible language) about exhibited images. Four drawing workshops open to the public at the Natural History Museum (in partnership with 'The Big Draw' festival), The Eden Project, University College London and Falmouth University will ensure this project reaches a wide and diverse public audience. Ultimately we aim to challenge prevalent preconceptions about the division between art and science.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP007457%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Despite Kurt Lewin's well-known maxim ""there is nothing so practical as a good theory"", there is often a gap between theory and practice. The relationship between theory and practice (and theorists and practitioners) is not always harmonious, with theory often seen as remote from practice, and theorists (usually working in academic institutions) as having little to say of relevance to practitioners (in businesses, public sector organisations and other organisations outside academia).  This project will investigate the theory-practice relationship in the context of a particular issue: open-access (OA) publication and dissemination of research.  Making research outputs (peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters etc) publicly available for anyone to access and use is now becoming increasingly common. Many research funders worldwide now require grant holders to do so. However, open access of this sort creates numerous challenges: economic, technical, and cultural, to name just some. These challenges can be investigated in various ways, but one potentially valuable way is to develop, use and test theory in relation to OA. Theory, encompassing, as Susan Gregor puts it, ""conjectures, models, frameworks, or body of knowledge"", has the potential to help analyse and explain phenomena, even offer predictions on what could happen given certain conditions, or suggest what actions should be taken to achieve intended outcomes.  This project will investigate the interactions between open access theory and practice. In particular, it will address the question of the extent to which theory has been helpful in explaining the OA phenomenon and has been used to inform action by practitioners. It will investigate the value placed on theory in research on OA by both academic researchers and practitioners (including policymakers, publishers and librarians), and the way theory has informed OA practice. It will also investigate how OA practice has informed theory.  The project will begin by examining how theory has already been used in relation to OA. An initial analysis of the peer-reviewed literature shows that around 20 theories have been used in various ways in research on OA. These include widely-used theories like Game Theory (derived from Applied Mathematics) and Commons Theory (from Economics). Other theories used have included Innovation Diffusion Theory (which aims to understand ways communities adopt new developments) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (which focuses on factors affecting individuals' take-up of technologies). The ways in which OA studies have generated theory will also be covered. The ways in which theories have been used or developed, which aspects of OA they have been used to explain, and what kinds of outcomes and recommendations have resulted from the studies will be analysed. The project will then go on to conduct detailed interviews with stakeholders involved in OA, examining the value and use of theory in informing practice, and how the practice of OA feeds into theory development. Policymakers, librarians, publishers, consultants and researchers will be invited to share their attitudes to theory (positive and negative), with a total of about 40 interviews being conducted. Their views will be closely analysed using well-established thematic analysis methods and other approaches enabling a detailed picture of the theory-practice relationship relating to OA to be built up.  This project will address these issues in order to cast light on both the open access phenomenon itself and on the theory-practice question. It is hoped in doing so it will contribute a better understanding of OA, currently an important and controversial area policy development, and of the relationship between theory and practice, an issue which goes to the heart of the value of academic research and its impact on real-world applications in public policy, commercial innovation and professional practice.","The proposed project is designed to make an impact both in relation to open access and the theory-practice relationship. It is expected, for example, to:   - impact on the professional practice of library and information service providers - influence policy development amongst research funders and other policymakers - enhance knowledge-exchange approaches amongst research managers - interact with the work of consultants in the area - provide context for commercial decision making for publishers - inform practice of researchers and educators in the LIS and beyond The proposal directly addresses the AHRC Digital Transformations Theme and the RCUK Digital Economy Priority Area, and is therefore expected to have impact in the ways anticipated in those areas. In particular, it relates to aspects of the Digital Transformations theme including: ""changes in publishing...the democratisation of scholarship and the globalisation of the knowledge economy...transformations of disciplines and inter-disciplinarity...[and] questions of access and availability..."" Direct beneficiaries are expected to be library and information service providers, policy makers and funders, knowledge-exchange managers, consultants, publishers, researchers and LIS educators. For librarians, who are often on the front line of OA development in institutions, this proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of how theory is being (and might be) used to inform their activity in, for example, improving their understanding of user behaviours in relation to OA systems, or the influence of disciplinary differences in shaping researcher OA adoption. Policymakers and funders from government-funded agencies and charities, often responsible for forming policy in relation to OA, will benefit from a greater understanding of OA in general, and also the specific issue of the relationship between theory and policy formation. Knowledge exchange managers in HE institutions and elsewhere, responsible for developing KE policies, processes and relationships, are likely to have their activities informed, particularly in relation to the KE potential of theory (often assumed to be problematical). Consultants working on OA and KE, often carrying out research themselves which generates theory (including models, frameworks etc) - although not always be labelled as such - may benefit from an exploration of the relationship of their own work with explicitly theoretically-informed content produced by researchers. Publishers, who are making commercial decisions in relation to OA, will benefit from a greater understanding of OA and the role that theory might have in helping them understand the market, customer behaviours and commercial models.  It is important to note that researchers working in LIS in particular and the Social Sciences and Humanities more generally are also key potential beneficiaries of the project (apart from the direct academic benefits above). They will benefit by having practitioners' attitudes about theory reflected back to them in such a way as can inform their own practice. Consideration of the role practitioners have (or might) in forming theory, both by contributing data in various forms and through engaging in a deeper co-production process is also important. This reflective element of the project is central in order to ensure that that the theory-practice relationship is considered from both directions. Linked to this, LIS educators, who are in a position to encourage students (future practitioners) to consider the theory-practice relationship, will have their teaching informed by the work of this project. Beyond these specific groups, there are a number of stakeholders from a variety of sectors (commercial, public, charity and educational) who will potentially benefit from a better understanding of the OA phenomenon and how it might affect their work and also about how their activities might be informed by theory in various ways.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP014569%2F1

Its major research output, www.englandsimmigrants.com, provides a database of nearly 65,000 named individuals born outside England who lived within its bounds in the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. In particular, it captures all the data for the government inquiry conducted in 1440 in preparation for a universal tax on persons born outside the kingdom - the only such documented process before 1841. The 1440 data thus provide a unique snapshot of the names, nationalities, places of English residence, occupations, households and family structures of up to 20,000 aliens - approaching 1% of the population of mid-fifteenth-century England.  From Sept 2016, the GCSE curriculum for History will include major components on the long-term history of migration to the British Isles. The shortage of suitable resources to support teaching and learning for the medieval elements of these modules has prompted the designers of the new curriculum (the Oxford and Cambridge and RSA Examination Board, and the Schools History Project) to seek support from the England's Immigrants team. The present project is a collaboration of the University of York, The National Archives, and the Historical Association, together with an independent Consultant, to create online resource packages that support teaching and learning in the history of migration to Britain at Key Stages [KS] 2-5 of the National Curriculum, including GCSE, and to develop an impact evaluation tool that will generate significant data on the impact of research-based teaching and learning of History in schools.  AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The aims of the present project are: 1. To enhance the impact of the successful AHRC-funded research project, 'England's Immigrants, 1330-1550'  2. To make a key contribution to the study of migration in schools (KS 2-5 and GCSE)  3. To create methodologies for measuring the impact of AHRC-funded research in schools The objectives (fully detailed in the separate Objectives section) are: 1. To create a definitive online resource for KS 2-5 teachers and students that allows effective use of the database www.englandsimmigrants.com in the new GCSE curriculum from Sept. 2016 2. To create a definitive online resource for KS 2-5 teachers and students for the history of migration between the coming of the Romans (55BCE) and the expulsion of the Jews (1290) 3. To create a methodology for the systematic evaluation of the impact of this project during the academic year 2016-17  4. To enable a group of KS 2-5 teachers to engage pro-actively in the development of new, research-based teaching resources on the history of migration in the Middle Ages    APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS The online resource packages linked to Objectives 1 and 2 and the impact evaluation tool developed under Objective 3 (together with the resulting impact evaluation report) will be made freely available via www.englandsimmigrants.com and www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/.   The outputs are all designed to maximise the impact of AHRC-funded research in the teaching and learning of History in Schools. To achieve this aim, the project identifies five groups of beneficiaries: 1. Teachers and students who use the resulting resources at KS 2-5 and in GCSE  2. Examination boards, who will have access to reliable, research-based resources to support migration history 3. Public agencies, include RCUK and HEFCE Impact strategists, who will benefit from the findings and conclusions of the impact evaluation report 4. Researchers in Education, and specifically those working on research-based teaching and learning 5. Participants in the Teacher Scholar Programme run as part of the activities of the project, for their career development","The beneficiaries of the project will be: 1. Teachers and students who use the online resource packages for Key Stages 2-5 and in preparation for new GCSE modules on migration. The Oxford and Cambridge and RSA Examination Board and the Schools History Project, who have jointly developed the specifications for the new GCSE curriculum, expect a significant uptake on the migration options available from Sept 2016; the identification of the need for up-to-date, research-based resources to support the medieval elements of these options has been the main driver to this application. The two resource packages, 'England's Immigrants, 1330-1550' and 'Migration to Britain, 55BCE-1350', will be available online in time for the first cohort of students taking the GCSE curriculum from Sept 2016, and the project includes a dissemination strategy designed to provide timely and effective news of the availability of these resources.    2. Examination boards, who will have access to reliable, research-based resources to support their modules in migration history. In addition to the Oxford and Cambridge and RSA Examination Board, AQA have also indicated an interest both in the new resources to be created and in the impact evaluation report. By having the resources available in time for the first cohort of GCSE students, and by completing the impact evaluation report by the end of the academic year 2016-17, the project will ensure timely quantification of the uptake of its outputs, as well as generating key data on the ways in which migration history is being taught and understood within the National Curriculum. 3. Public agencies, include RCUK and HEFCE Impact strategists, which will benefit from the findings and conclusions of the impact evaluation report completed by the end of the academic year 2016-17. The timing and relevance of the report will have the potential to influence ongoing thinking about the methodology for evaluating the impact of research in the Arts and Humanities.  4. Researchers in Education, and specifically those working on research-based teaching and learning (including the project partner, the Historical Association; the Schools History Project; and other similar organizations), who will benefit from a model of collaboration between RCUK-funded research and schools-based education and, through consideration of the impact evaluation tool and impact evaluation report, will be able to advance understanding and further research on the nature and quality of History teaching in schools.    5. Participants in the Teacher Scholar Programme run as part of the activities of the project, for their career development. The Teacher Scholar Programme represents a direct response to the recent report, P. Cordingley et al., Developing Great Teaching: Lessons from the International Reviews into Effective Professional Development (Teacher Development Trust, 2014), which highlights the importance of CPD in enhancing the quality of teaching. Participants will be active contributors to the follow-on funding project, and will be encouraged to disseminate their experiences and reflections during and after the programme (including their own involvement in teaching the new GCSE modules from Sept 2016) through social media and through the publications and conference activities of the Historical Association, the Schools History Project, and other professional associations and contacts.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN005848%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The practical identification of individuals has, in the modern period, taken a number of forms - from Early Modern badges and insignia to the contemporary strobe light of a retinal scanner. The term 'identification' can also be taken to mean a number of things, including the determination of individual personhood via paperwork, bodily examination, verbal testimony, and digital recording; the detection of false or forged identities; the creation of offender profiles by forensic psychologists; and the taxonomic (and later genetic) tracing of ethnic 'types'. This subject has been of recent interest in historical, social scientific and biological scholarship. However, what has been neglected to date is the inherent connections that exist between techniques of identification (as defined above) and the intimate personal identity divulged by literary and artistic representation. The question of who we are, in the practical sense of identifying individuals via their documents and bodies, has remained curiously absent from the question of who we are in terms of our intimate portrayal of the self.  This research network will seek to redress this discrepancy by examining the papers of identity documents alongside a range of written and visual media and thereby advance a fresh interpretive model for the consideration of both identificatory practices and the artistic depiction of identity. The broad spectrum of participants speaks to the interdisciplinary nature of the project and its ability to resonate across different areas of study and practice. To achieve its objectives, the network will advance conversation and collaboration via a series of four day-long workshops its website and twitter feed. The online activities will involve the dissemination of research questions, potential reading lists and thematic concerns prior to workshops and the publishing of papers and discussion topics following the workshops. Postgraduate students and early career researchers will form an integral part of the workshop and help to sustain its ongoing existence and development. The first workshop, at the University of Cambridge, will focus on the theme of 'image and information' and address the central first question of how identity documents can be interpreted as cultural artifacts that connect with artistic representations of identity. The second workshop, at the University of Illinois, will move on to think more specifically about the site of many identificatory practices - the human body - and consider its relationship to the kinds of bodies depicted in art and literature. The third workshop, at the University of Birmingham, will bring together academics, practitioners of forensic science and a range of creative practioners in order to consider the ways in which their varying models of identity could be brought to bear on each other. The fourth and final workshop, held at the Library of Birmingham, will comprise a working meeting between key members of the network steering group and museum professionals, curators and archivists. Building on the content of these workshops, the aim of the meeting will be to develop a conceptual framework which will accommodate the various interdisciplinary and professional approaches to identification and identity developed by the network. This framework will actively develop a rationale for reading a host of different identity documents as works of art, thereby realizing a huge potential within various archival material held in locations such as the Library of Birmingham. The stimulation of new creative work will also be addressed with the inclusion of practicing writers and artists.","Practitioners of Identification. Workshop 3 will bring practitioners of identification techniques (forensic scientists and psychologists) into contact with academics and creative writers and artists. This confrontation of working practices will facilitate the active questioning of the creative and fictional components of analytical, factually-based, methods and vice versa. By facilitating discussions between these groups practitioners of identification will benefit from the opportunity to inform those groups who are most responsible for the public image of forensics in contemporary society - thereby contributing to the authenticity with which creative practitioners represent forensic activity. Reversing this, the confrontation of ideas referred to above will encourage practitioners of identification to reflect upon their own practices in an original way. The creative aspect of forensic profiling (the fact that it involves the imaginative modeling of individuality) is one particular aspect that the workshop will bring out, thus allowing for a potentially altered perspective to be brought to bear upon working practices. The academic perspective offered by key participants of the network from humanities disciplines (with their attendant methodologies and assumptions about agency and subjectivity) will contribute a further layer to the questioning of forensic technique by its practitioners. Creative Practitioners In a related outcome to the above, creative writers (fiction, TV and film) and artists will, via the interaction with professionals in forensic science and psychology, be faced with new ways of questioning their own depictions of self-identity. Assumptions about the working practices of forensic scientists will thus be addressed and clarified via the sharing of working practices - up-to-date information on forensic techniques offering new ideas with which to depict identity in contemporary media. Bringing both of these groups into contact with academics from a range of disciplines with further enhance this enquiry. This will occur firstly because scholarly research from, for example, the disciplines of history and literary studies consider 'identity' in often quite different terms to either each other or common usage - they can thus offer additional layers of meaning which can be mined by creative practitioners. Secondly, the interdisciplinary nature of the AI network will allow for these diverse academic ideas to be questioned themselves, thereby realising new and original approaches to the contemporary identity depicted by creative practitioners. Museum Curators and Professionals Key members of this group will have been invited to all of the first three workshops and their inclusion will culminate in Workshop 4. Exposing those involved in the recording and archiving of various forms of identity documents (identity cards, photographs, prison records, census materials) and artifacts (anthropometric measuring devices, fingerprint specimens, human remains) to the ideas generated by the network will allow these practitioners to review their holdings with a fresh perspective. Workshop 4 will then actively develop a conceptual framework which will accommodate the various interdisciplinary and professional approaches to identification and identity developed by the network. This framework will promote a rationale for reading a host of different identity documents and artifacts in ways that emphasise not only their aesthetic value but also their key role in the creation of self-idenity as we think of it today. Huge potential within collections in locations such as the Library of Birmingham (where workshop 4 will be held) and the Universities of Birmingham and Cambridge will therefore be activated.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM011143%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project focuses on Neolithic 'crannogs' - artificially-constructed islands - in the Outer Hebrides. Until recently, crannogs in Scotland were thought to have been constructed from the Early Iron Age (c. 800 BC) onwards. Discoveries made since 2012 have demonstrated conclusively that multiple sites in the Outer Hebrides are in fact 2500 years earlier, with artificial islets a potentially widespread feature of the Neolithic there. Our work has now identified six sites associated with large collections of Neolithic pottery (with four of these radiocarbon dated to c. 3640-3360 cal BC). In some cases, these assemblages have included near-complete vessels deposited directly into the lochs, possibly as a result of 'ritual' deposition and/or feasting; the inertia of the loch bed sediments has ensured amazingly well-preserved ceramics, with levels of completeness unprecedented in Neolithic Britain. These 'islands of stone' were created simply by piling up large rocks on the loch bed - impressive constructions 25m in diameter and 4m high. On the sites investigated in Lewis so far, no buildings have been identified. However, in one case - this project's showcase site at Loch Bhorgastail - waterlogged worked timbers suggest complex wooden architecture, and impressive levels of organic preservation for a site of this date in Britain. It is possible that some of these crannogs may have been settlement-related, but others are too small to have housed buildings. Their monumental, cairn-like forms echo the contemporary funerary monuments known across the region. Given the deposition of artefacts into the loch around them, it is possible that they may have been special purpose 'ritual' locations. These are enigmatic sites whose function is, at present, hard to understand. They require significant further investigation.  Neolithic crannogs essentially represent a new site type for the period. However, almost all of those identified so far are located within central Lewis - the only area that has been searched intensively. Eilean Domhnuill, N. Uist remains the only definite site known elsewhere. Its presence there suggests, tantalisingly, that many more Neolithic crannogs may lie undiscovered across the Outer Hebrides. This project seeks to address this situation by identifying and then ground-truthing other sites with potential across the islands. We also plan to carry out two seasons of excavation in order to characterise one highly promising site (Bhorgastail). Using cutting-edge scientific analyses, we will investigate what happened at the site and how it related to activity in the wider landscape, leading to properly informed, new interpretations. These new sites have the potential to transform existing narratives of the British and wider European Neolithic.  In order to communicate our results to the academic community, we will produce an open access monograph and additional papers focused on key issues. We will also organise an international conference in order to gather together researchers working on lake settlements across the world. Beyond academia, the project will have impact in a variety of spheres: enhancing tourism in the region through development of an augmented reality heritage app and pop-up exhibitions; improving knowledge of the archaeological resource for heritage management professionals; collaborating with and empowering local archaeology groups; and disseminating knowledge through open days, public talks, school visits and teaching information packs.  Ultimately, the Islands of Stone project will establish a clear interpretation of these new sites, transforming our understandings of the Neolithic and of the enigmatic, multi-period site type of 'crannog' in general. Site categories are rarely pushed back 2500 years in date. New kinds of Neolithic site are almost never found. Waterlogged deposits of this date are extremely rare. The promise that these new sites hold is enormous.","Previous experience has demonstrated that this project - because it involves underwater exploration, newly-discovered sites, beautiful landscapes and impressive finds - has tremendous potential to capture the public imagination. Our impact strategy as a whole seeks to build on this inspirational core, developing a series of mechanisms through which to raise the profile of the tremendously rich, but currently undervalued, prehistoric heritage of the Outer Hebrides amongst a range of audiences. Our ultimate aims are (1) to improve awareness and enjoyment of the islands' heritage, in doing so boosting tourism and creating economic growth in the region, and (2) to create a solid, grassroots base of knowledge about and care for the islands' archaeology - a sustainable platform on which to build continued expansion in this area beyond the life of the project.  We expect a wide range of people to benefit from the project's findings: 1. Visitors to the Outer Hebrides Visitors will benefit from the project in a number of different ways. An app to be developed in collaboration with the Ordnance Survey will significantly enhance the heritage-related elements of people's tourist experience, identifying sites to visit and providing authentic information about these in an engaging and contemporary format. Visitors will also be able to enjoy our pop-up exhibition about the Islands of Stone project and the wider Neolithic archaeology of the islands (see below), as well as public talks and open days.  2. Local museums and airports Three museums and two airports will host our pop-up exhibition. Museums will benefit from being able to showcase a contemporary research project and 'live' excavation alongside their permanent displays, adding value to the visitor experience. Equally, our displays in the islands' two main airports will provide the wider and different audience passing through them with a welcome distraction as they wait and information about things to see and do during their stay.  3. Local archaeology groups (and the wider public) We will be working with local archaeology groups throughout - notably in surveying sites and excavating at Bhorgastail. Our project partners 'Access Archaeology' have a strong history of participation in research projects. As their letter of support makes clear, the group's activity currently depends substantially on being involved in externally generated projects; they will also benefit from learning new techniques (e.g. underwater survey methods, scientific analysis). We will also disseminate information about the wider research context of our project to local societies and other interested members of the public through talks and open days.  4. Teachers and schoolchildren We will involve local schools through a wider package of outreach work, including school visits and a teaching information pack. Local people (including schools) will also benefit significantly from the app's availability - in selecting sites to visit, undertaking local history projects, etc.  5. Heritage professionals Our research will enhance the NRHE and local HER, refining knowledge about known sites and identifying new sites, leading to increased understanding and more effective management of the heritage resource. The project will also help HES to deliver multiple elements of the Scottish Government's Our Place in Time historic environment strategy document, especially those within the 'share and celebrate' theme.  6. Ordnance Survey and Historic Environment Scotland The OS are very keen to develop their existing app technology to incorporate heritage content. They see this project as a critical pilot study for an application which could be rolled out nation- and even world-wide in future, leading to potentially significant additional financial income. Equally, HES will benefit from the project in a number of ways, with aspects helping to fulfil all five of their designated strategic aims (HES 2016)",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS010157%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project applies for funding under the follow-on funding for impact and engagement scheme, under the 10th anniversary highlight notice. The Bibliography of British and Irish History (BBIH) - formerly the Royal Historical Society Bibliography - was funded under the old scheme [APN15510] in 2007 as a resource enhancement award. There were five project objectives, including ""to widen access to the data by exposing it to OAI (Open Archives Initiative) harvesters, such as OAIster, and to online search engines"". In the intervening eight years the possibilities for exposing and enriching data have become vastly more powerful and pervasive. This was simply not possible in 2007 and the time is now right to take advantage of these developments, to expose as linked data the detailed thesaurus which underpins the Bibliography's comprehensive cataloguing system, allowing other historical projects to benefit, and, as the semantic web develops, to integrate historical resources in a way which has transformative potential: such linkage, is moreover, only possible with a detailed classification system this project will provide.  The thesaurus will be marked up in SKOS, the Simple Knowledge Organization System (http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/), which is the best choice for marking up a thesaurus. It is simple to use, making it ideal for use by historical projects, while integrating well with the Web Ontology Language OWL (the two can be linked using OWL's annotation properties). The Institute of Historical Research (IHR) proposes to publish as a web ontology the Royal Historical Society's subject classification for British and Irish History - the premier thesaurus in its subject area, comprising 8,800 terms. This will provide a comprehensive, standard resource for all British and Irish history projects wishing to expose their data and link it to other projects using RDF (Resource Description Framework). As an exemplar, the IHR will mark up its own extensively used History Online data (www.history.ac.uk/history-online/) with the RHS thesaurus terms, as a demonstration of the process and its value, as well as a human-readable version of the thesaurus, so that projects or scholars wishing to use a history ontology will quickly be able to see the scope and detail the thesaurus can offer. Additional aids to scholars or those unfamiliar with SKOS will be online tutorials, including worked examples. The IHR will hold a workshop at the end of the project, drawing on its extensive contacts with the local history and family history community, to demonstrate the benefits of the project to those inside and outside academia. To further demonstrate the applicability of the thesaurus, the Bodleian Library's John Johnson Collection of printed ephemera, produced in conjunction with ProQuest, will be marked up using the web ontology, proving its use in enhancing a disparate and heavily image-based collection. The bibliography first produced its subject classification in the late 1990s. The thesaurus drew on the categorisation used for the earlier print volumes and was developed in consultation with the history profession. It has been revised and refined ever since. It now contains 8,800 terms. The thesaurus is known, at least in outline, to all users of the bibliography (the relevant parts of the subject tree are displayed with every record), which effectively means all historians of British and Irish History: although BBIH has been a subscription service since 2010, practically all UK Higher Education institutions with history departments subscribe. It is also used by the bibliography of Irish history, Irish History Online (http://www.irishhistoryonline.ie/). It has been used by a commercial company, Taylor & Francis, to mark up its online English Historical Documents series http://www.englishhistoricaldocuments.com/.","The project's intention to mark up its History Online dataset will directly lead to impact among publishers. History Online consists of a number of datasets, for some of which data is directly supplied by publishers. Ten publishers currently subscribe to the service on History Online which lists new books and journal articles, including leading publishers like Oxford University Press, Routledge and Yale. Not only will these publishers see the benefit of their material being marked up in SKOS, the IHR's direct relationship with them will enable it to publicise the project as an enhancement to the listings, via the quarterly email that is sent to subscribers. Furthermore History Online contains datasets directly related to the history profession in the UK: listings of Theses Completed, Theses in Progress, Teachers of History (at a university level) and Grants for historians. All of these are free and in constant use. Thus for many historians History Online may be the first introduction to linked data in practical use, and this can only disseminate knowledge and understanding of this valuable technology throughout the profession. The IHR is leading the way in helping historians to negotiate the new terrain created by moves towards open access in academia (it has organised conferences on the subject and maintains an information resource on the subject, http://openaccess.blogs.sas.ac.uk/). Open access and linked open data are a natural fit and each will become more deeply connected with the other as both develop. This project will put the IHR at the forefront in these two areas and will be ideally placed to help historians engage with the issue as part of its mandate as the national centre for History in the UK. The project will hold a workshop specifically aimed at workers in the Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums sector. The IHR has close connections with some of the leading members of this group. It has been a collaborator on two separate Big Data projects which finished at the end of March 2015, one with the British Library and the other with the National Archives. The IHR has particularly close relations with the British Library's digital curators and will invite one of them to present at the end-of-project workshops. Members of the Museums Association will be invited to attend this workshop. The project will publish training materials online, with screencasts, tutorials and worked examples. This will be aimed at a non-technical audience. Perhaps the most important, and certainly the broadest impact will be among the public. Personal interest is a thriving area in the field of British history, with family history an enormously popular activity, a proliferation of local history societies catering to an interest in topographical and regional history, and deep interest in the UK's heritage in architecture, social and political history and popular culture. All of these areas would benefit greatly from the ability to link silos of information and to query the great mass of information available via a protocol such as SPARQL, which enables complex queries to be created in a way that non-semantic search engines such as Google simply cannot provide. Furthermore the Institute of Historical Research, which aims to be the hub of academic history in the UK, plays a role among these independent scholars. For example, the IHR publishes the standard work of county history in the England, the Victoria County History, and thus coordinates the VCH's work among volunteers and independent scholars across the counties. The IHR also has links with the British Association for Local History (BALH). The IHR is uniquely placed to disseminate the importance of the thesaurus to all of these groups, and it will hold two workshops at the end of the project: one will focus on local history and one on family history, giving practical advice on how this new and powerful semantic web tool can be used.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003446%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              With the continual unfolding of new digital technologies and possibilities, digital resources are beginning to play a significant role in the activities and experiences of ""grass-roots"" musicians and dancers, singers and dancers in England's contemporary folk scene. There has been a considerable growth in the popularity and profile of folk arts in England over the last fifteen years; within this wave of new interest, internet-based resources have introduced new participants to repertory, skills and information. Simultaneously, developments in solid-state digital technology mean that musicians and dancers are now making recordings of themselves and others (for instance, in sessions, using portable digital recorders or smartphones). Far from being passive consumers of this digital media, musicians and dancers are actively developing new ways to assimilate and utilise the materials they find and generate. Amateur and professional musicians and dancers are engaging with a growing wealth of digital resources ranging from internet-based archives (e.g. The Full English) to self-generated recordings and transcriptions. The extent and nature of the impact of these digital/digitised materials to individuals, groups, amateurs, professionals and activists within England's folk scene are as yet somewhat assumed, largely unclear and under-examined, and the focus of the 'Digital Folk' project.  'Digital Folk' will look in detail at the uses, distributions and impacts of digital/digitised materials (e.g. recordings/transcriptions/manuscript reproductions) within English folk arts cultures. The research will involve observing musicians and dancers and dancers as they utilise or otherwise engage with various materials, and will move towards building a picture of the ways in which users interact with different types and formats of resource. It will look to understand how such materials impact on the ways in which folk musicians and dancers interact with each other, and will consider the online networks and relationships that emerge between the practitioners, in order to discover how the sharing and exchange of such materials transform the social nature of folk culture. Finally, it will examine the ways in which, and extent to which, digitally-oriented activities intersect with face-to-face ""real-world"" interactions, and how the modernity of such activities is accommodated within new concepts of 'tradition'. The project will aim to develop a new understanding of the ramifications of digital resources for development and change in the content, concept and practice of folk arts in contemporary England. To do this, the project will address the following questions: 1. How do traditional musicians and dancers in England use digital resources? What are the most common uses of such resources by folk musicians and dancers? What opportunities are folk musicians and dancers able to explore through those resources?  2. How do folk/traditional musicians and dancers in England conceptualise their engagements with digital resources? Do they consider the use of modern digital tools and media in relation to the ""traditional"" nature of the music they perform? If so, how? 3. What are the emerging impacts of digital resources on the artistic and cultural attributes of England's folk arts? What impacts can be observed, and what affects appear imminent?","The research will directly and immediately benefit any organisation developing digital resources to facilitate participation in the folk arts: the detailed ethnography produced by the research will offer in-depth market research of the practices and attitudes of target end-users. The project's closing report will be explicitly aimed at addressing these research needs as they relate to the partner organisation - the EFDSS - by gathering information on the impact of their resources, but the nature and impact of resources produced by other similar organisations will also be assessed. Other organisations whose resources are likely to feature (and who will therefore benefit from the research) are: thesession.org; mudcatcafe.org; the Irish Traditional Music Archive; and Folkworks. However, since no such research currently exists in relation to any similar organisations worldwide, the findings of this research are likely to benefit any creators of digital resources relating to participation in ""traditional"" activities globally.  By providing targeted findings and proposals to EFDSS and the creators of digital folk resources, the research will indirectly benefit their end users: implementation of proposals and review of resource formats in view of the project's findings will result in resource construction that best meets the needs of participants.   In the medium term (1-2 years from completion), there is strong potential for the research to benefit the app design and computing industries through providing detailed market research on the availability, nature and limits of existing technologies (including applications and software) to cater for the increasingly popular activity of traditional folk arts participation (as well as for creative communities more generally).  In the longer term (c.5 years) there is also strong potential for the project to deliver findings that will be instrumental in the review of copyright policies and legislations as they relate to the distribution and licensing of ""traditional"" music. Historically, the concept of ""the traditional"" (particularly in relation to music) has been found to be at odds with commercially driven licensing controls and copyright law - the negotiation of an exemption for Morris Dancing in the Licensing Act 2003 shows that antagonisms of this kind continue, and the increased opportunities for the distribution of digitally recorded materials are accompanied by new ethical and commercial concerns relating to notions of artistic property and creative common-ownership within the folk arts. For these reasons, the research has strong potential to impact on the formulation of publication policies of folk music-related websites, and the licensing policies of the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society and Performing Rights Society.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL014858%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This network will take the relatively new field of live coding research to its next development stage and strengthen the UK's position as one of the leading countries in this field. It will bring together researchers from a wide variety of disciplines to explore how live coding can enrich technological engagement in wider culture.  Live coding is a new approach to creative expression using computers. In live coding, the innards of software are exposed and rewired through live, direct, and exploratory use of custom made programming languages. Practitioners perform on stage by writing code that generates the audiovisual work; it is a form of real-time notating or scoring music, visuals, dance or robotics. The screen is projected, enabling the audience to follow the development of the code. Since the computer interprets the code live, every edit to the code is immediately reflected in the musical or visual end result. Live coding has a strong pedagogical and performance element, and has proven to be applicable right across the arts, research, and industry. Interest in live coding is growing across science, technology and engineering: the digital arts are uniquely placed in the field of technological innovation, as they place the human experience of programming at the core of technological interaction. Live coding is a field where technological development is arts-led, and where computer languages are seen as rich environments for creative expression.  This trans-disciplinary network will bring key researchers and practitioners from diverse disciplines together with the aim of enabling dialogue and research collaboration across academy and industry. The network will serve as a hub for activities in research, development, and education; activities will take place internationally, and be strongly centred within the UK research landscape. Although the network is UK based, it includes leading international researchers in the field, and it will foster for strong international outreach and industry connections, that will support and maintain the UKs leading role as the centre of live coding research and practice. The network will explore themes of live coding in the arts, computing in education, and cultural engagement. This will be investigated through three workshops, one international conference, and diverse publications. Wider cultural impact will be achieved through industry events, musical performances, media engagement, online fora, software releases, and public workshops. The network will disseminate its research to other researchers and the general public through a strong, open access web-presence. The past ten years have seen many exciting developments in live coding, which has matured into an established approach in the digital arts, visible across published literature (including a forthcoming Computer Music Journal special issue), academic conferences, digital arts festivals, and in national and international media. Working with the fundamental premise that everybody can program computers, provided that the goals are interesting and the right tools are available, live coding is uniquely placed to bridge relationships across the educational, academic and industry sectors, and contribute to the recent emphasis on programming in the national curriculum.","Live coding is attracting increasing interest from diverse fields, due to issues around technology, culture, language and creativity that it makes visible. Below, we list the specific Impact Areas (IAs) that will benefit from this research network. IA1: Cultural and creative industries Programming is common across the cultural and creative industries, including computer games (see IA3), but also areas such as film animation, architecture, music technology, interactive design and other digital arts practice. By engaging with creative agencies, including project partners Field, academia and industry involve in a bidirectional relationship where both can learn from each other's processes (e.g. http://tinyurl.com/br47jym) by exchanging new technologies and methods. This network will establish strong links between industry and academia through planned activities and online channels that will outlast the project's lifetime. IA2: Education Computer programming is now a national priority in government policy and educational curricula (see for example http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16493929). Live coding is of growing interest to this area, with project partner Blackwell working with the Raspberry PI foundation to introduce live coding in schools. Professor Mark Guzdial (recipient of IEEE teaching award for computing education) has demonstrated dramatic impacts on gender balance in higher education, and has publicly stated that live coding in computer science lectures is ""best practice"". IA3: Computer Games Live coding applies to computer games not only to exploratory game design, but the inclusion of programmable behaviour as part of end-user game mechanics. Project partner Griffiths (FoAM) is actively carrying out research into in-game programming languages, with projected impact on the computer games industry, but also the related field of ""serious games,"" where educational topics are explored through playful interfaces. Live coding allows for changing a game in real-time, useful when considering the application domains of serious games (such as key-hole surgery and more).  IA4: Music and Performance Technology The growth of live coding has benefitted by the thirst for new technology in musical culture, to find new sounds and means of expression. Music technology research is well developed, through academic conferences such as New Interfaces for Musical Expression, and through strong links to a thriving music technology industry. This network will create contexts where live coding is exposed directly to musicians and artists in other performance arts. IA5: Software engineering Software engineers have operated with a concept of interactive programming for a while, but in practice this has largely been limited to the debugging of already written code. Live coding brings this practice into a new light, opening up programming as a collaborative activity, enabling groups of programmers to work on running code together. It thus adds a new tool to the research field and practice of Extreme Programming (where two or more programmers collaborate). IA6: Cognitive neuroscience The neurological substrates of language is a research interest for many cognitive neuroscientists, such as project partner Benn. Due to the tightly controlled conditions required for experimental methods, such research often focusses on the use of formal language, e.g., mathematics. Live coding is exciting for this field as an example of language use in live, social and creative situations, yet more readily observable than natural language. IA7: Wider culture Technology is invading our lives through smartphone apps, on-line social networks and the move towards ubiquitous computing. Live coding presents technology as open, manipulable, and social. The importance of this is recognised by cultural researchers such as the Participatory IT group in Aarhus, who are now investigating participatory design of programming languages.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL007266%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Between the fourth and the sixth centuries exile was a legal sanction frequently used by Roman emperors and the rulers of the post-Roman successor states against dissident Christian clerics. This project seeks to test the hypothesis that such exile proved to be not only a form of punishment, but also, and more importantly, a form of cultural encounter. Clerics in exile spread their ideas at places where they had previously been unknown. They also absorbed influences from their new environment and, in the case of recall from exile, transferred ideas and experiences elsewhere. This process, the project contends, had a profound impact on the development of Christianity and its foundational texts in this period, which are still noticeable today. For example, the Nicene creed, which most of modern Christian denominations subscribe to, may not have had the same impact without the banishment of its original supporters during the fourth century. In order to prove its hypothesis, the project adopts an interdisciplinary approach with an innovative methodology. It is a collaboration between Dr Julia Hillner (Sheffield, PI), a legal historian, and two international co-investigators, Prof Jörg Ulrich (Halle), a theologian, and Associate Prof Jakob Engberg (Aarhus), a cultural historian. While both the development of Christian theology and ritual in this period and the legal development of the Roman penalty of exile have been extensively studied, the two have not been brought together before. The project seeks to rectify this gap in scholarship by re-invigorating traditional legal and theological studies that have typically concentrated on normative sources through the application of a digital approach that will help to set these sources in context. To this end, the project includes the construction of a relational database that collects all available information on individual clerical exiles. The data will be derived from printed and online source editions and we anticipate a dataset comprising records for approximately 1,000 individuals. This will allow the project team to trace and visualise the personal and geographical networks clerical exiles developed and maintained from their place of banishment and after return from exile. The quantitative information will provide the basis for a thorough qualitative re-assessment of selected legal, theological and hagiographical texts of the period (also available in edited form), which will be investigated in the light of the networks of their authors and audiences. This part of the project will seek to establish the influence of exile experiences on the formation of Christian law, Christian doctrine and Christian cult in late antiquity. In short, the project involves a long-term study of exile that focuses on social networks of individual clerics and interprets institutional texts and structures not according to a top-down model of change, but as a result of relations among individuals, facilitated by exile, within a decentralised framework, in which every element of the network contributed to shape institutional developments. The results of the project will be disseminated via a book co-authored by the PI, the Co-Is and the research associate of the project, and via a doctoral dissertation. The project will also maintain a project blog and website, which will ensure access to the database for a larger academic audience, and, embedded in educational material, for a broader non-academic audience, and will hold a final international conference. The project will also develop a network of local museums and heritage organisations at places of late antique banishment with a view to develop closer collaboration for future funding applications. The project will commence in May 2014 and is scheduled to run for 36 months.","Exile, as understood by this project, did not separate, but, on the contrary, connected individuals and communities over space and cultures, creating new networks that had the power to change politics, law and belief. The results of the project's research are therefore of interest to all organisations and individuals seeking to understand both the positive and negative consequences of legally forced migration and mobility, be this in the historically specific context of late antiquity, or in contemporary society, where this context can serve as comparandum or inspiration. More precisely, beneficiaries of the project's research result beyond academic beneficiaries may include:  - Museum curators, heritage professionals and tourism agencies connected to the locations of banishment who may want to present their collections or sites from the perspective of how exile influenced the locality and connected it to other communities. These include UK based museums, such as the British Museum and the Museum of the Isles of Scilly (a frequent place of banishment in late antiquity), but also museums in Europe, in particular around the Mediterranean. - Individuals or schools, both nationally and internationally, who would like to learn more about the role of their own localities in the Mediterranean and northern European network created by late antique exile. - Policy makers at UK or Europe based think tanks, who are interested in understanding how the legal transfer of religious dissidents can lead to multiple, non-hierarchical influences on religious law, doctrine and behaviour, and who would like to explore our research data as a historical comparative to current events.  As this list of potential beneficiaries shows, the impact to be expected from this research is varied. Results of the research have the potential to increase the effectiveness of public policy, for example on religious dissidence and national security. In addition, they have the potential to increase the effectiveness of public services, such as UK based museums and schools, by fostering awareness of the historical role British localities and objects held by British museums played in the larger exchange of people and ideas around Europe and the Mediterranean. In this way our activities also tap into the larger public debate on the potentially artificial distinction between 'British', 'European' and 'Mediterranean' histories. Finally, results from our research may even have the potential to transform historical heritage into economic profit due to the unique combination of famous Church fathers and the topography created by exile, which connects some of the most spectacular tourist destinations, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean (e.g. Alexandria, Istanbul, Cyprus, or Petra), which may well inspire UK and foreign businesses working in the cultural tourism or heritage sector. Some of this impact will be realised and measured during the project's lifetime, though the project's various impact activities (the website, media contributions, the collaboration with museums, and the impact workshop). Staff working on the project, including junior members such as the research associate and the PhD student, will continuously be invited to disseminate their research results for the benefit of a broad and diverse public, particularly via the project blog, and will therefore develop valuable skills in public engagement.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL006812%2F1

Set against the background of the worldwide growth of pilgrimage and the increasing importance of sacred sites, the project's innovative approaches and timely research agenda also contribute substantially to defining and establishing the emerging field of Pilgrimage Studies.  At the heart of this project is a new, wide-ranging analysis of the meaning and breadth of 'pilgrimage' and the role of sacred places past and present. Why did pilgrimage matter in the past and why does it still matter today? In exploring these issues, the project focuses attention on the role of cathedrals: places where, uniquely, national and local history and identity, material culture and traditional and emerging religious practice can be encountered together. Pilgrimage was central to the development and status of English cathedrals in the Middle Ages and although most shrines were destroyed at the Reformation, many of the great churches and monasteries which housed them remain as cathedrals today, literally shaped by their pilgrim past and retaining a strong pilgrimage legacy. Anglican cathedrals are increasingly refocusing on and reinstating shrines, reflecting an international multi-faith phenomenon in which an estimated 200 million people across the world engage in pilgrimage and religious tourism annually. Cathedrals in England are the group of sacred sites visited by the largest, most diverse group of people. A recent report reveals that 27% of adults resident in England visited an Anglican cathedral at least once in the previous year (THEOS, 2012). Moreover, over 40% of those visitors came from faith traditions other than Christianity or had no religious affiliation. This suggests that cathedrals are seen as shaped by, but transcending, Christianity, offering unique access to the 'spiritual' within the context of history, heritage and culture, and providing meaningful spaces for people of all faiths and none. These developments demand fuller, rigorous, multi-disciplinary investigation so that the implications for cathedrals, visitors and communities can be explored in detail.  The project uses 4 cathedrals, Canterbury, York, Durham and Westminster (chosen to represent a range of historical, social, geographical, cultural and denominational settings, and varying policies on charging for entry) as historical and contemporary case studies. Research methods include analysis of architectural and visual material, archives and contemporary documents. Interviews, photo/audio-diaries, and participant observation will be employed to gather and examine the experiences and views of cathedral staff, volunteers, pilgrims, tourists and local residents (of all faiths or none).  English cathedrals face multiple challenges as they seek to balance meeting the needs of congregations and pilgrims with remaining accessible to wider communities and tourists, and funding the maintenance of their historic buildings. This project provides insight into the historical and contemporary significance and use of spaces in and around cathedrals and analyses the specific connections between spiritual practice, cultural and historic interest, and individual, local and national senses of belonging. Outputs will include books, journal articles, conferences, a website, and an interactive animated visualization of medieval pilgrim experience. Findings will inform a range of academic disciplines, enhance visitor provision, tourism strategies and heritage management in English cathedrals and other sites, and provide resources for use by schools and the wider public.","A key feature of 'Pilgrimage and English cathedrals, past and present' is the specific set of research questions generated by the PI's wide experience of creating cathedral interpretation schemes and pilgrimage resources. There are therefore clearly-identified partners and audiences already seeking the information and outputs which the project will produce. Two related strands of engagement will be developed. The first will give cathedrals much-needed understanding of past and present pilgrim interaction with buildings, thus strengthening management and visitor provision. The second will equip the growing numbers of organizations and individuals reviving and using pilgrimage sites/routes today with essential information about historical and current practice and demographics of pilgrimage in England. These processes will radically enhance access and inclusion, bringing social, cultural and economic benefits through extending heritage tourism.  Key beneficiaries 1. Cathedrals and other sacred sites  Management  The project team will work in depth with 4 Case Study cathedrals (Canterbury, Durham, York, Westminster) which together had over 3.2 million visitors/pilgrims in 2012. Greater understanding of the ways cathedrals were designed to be used and of current visitor/pilgrim experience and expectations will be provided and explored, equipping clergy and visitor and education services to manage and interpret buildings more effectively. The Virtual Canterbury pilgrim model will be a key tool: a major new development in digital heritage interpretation, it will help cathedrals and other sites understand, use and communicate their architectural and historical heritage. It will be freely accessible online and used in exhibitions, in 'Pilgrim Experience Days' recreating medieval pilgrimage for visitors, pilgrims and school groups, and in training staff and volunteers.  Project findings will also inform national policy and strategies for all English cathedrals (38 Anglican, 19 Roman Catholic). Anglican Cathedrals alone attracted 11.3 million visitors in 2012, not including overseas tourists. Through conferences and training workshops with partners, including the Association of English Cathedrals (representing Deans and Chapters), Cathedrals Plus (Education and Visitor Officers), and English Heritage [see Letters of Support], project outputs will shape policy on visitor access, re-instatement of shrines, interpretation for multi-cultural audiences and charging admission to sacred sites. A final conference for all stakeholders, including AEC, Cathedrals Plus, Church Buildings Division, Roman Catholic Patrimony Committee, English Heritage, DCMS, Historic Religious Buildings Alliance and Churches Tourism Association, will be held at the end of Year 3 by invitation of the Archbishop of Canterbury.  Visitors to cathedrals from all backgrounds, including local communities and schools, will gain greatly improved understanding of these major heritage/sacred sites through enhanced interpretation and access.  2. Pilgrims, pilgrim organizations and schools  The current resurgence of pilgrimage in England both crosses denominational and faith boundaries in unprecedented ways and draws in many without formal religious beliefs. It includes new uses of historic Christian sites (e.g. Asian and African communities now hold pilgrimages to Aylesford Priory while Hindus visit St Jude's Shrine, Faversham). Pilgrimage is also a key topic in the RE curriculum. The project website will offer a unique resource for individuals, organizations and schools, providing articles, images and a database of resources, and encouraging information exchange through an online forum. Legacy Through transforming management of sacred sites, enhancing visitor experience, and creating new dynamic channels of information and interaction, the project will build a lasting legacy and foundation for future projects.

It takes as its focus the coinage of Alexander the Great, a unique and utterly transformative phenomenon across an area from the modern Balkans to Afghanistan and India. Coins issued by Alexander and in his name after his death exist today in the millions, scattered in collections across the world. But they are also the victim, as small pieces of precious metal, of wanton destruction and looting in their source countries. The OPAL project will place online a corpus of 5000 coins of Alexander in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. It will do this in such a way as to create a framework of Linked Data resources that will allow their two collections to be virtually united for the first time, and that will create an extensible platform for the eventual incorporation of hundreds of thousands more coins in collections in other countries. As part of this massive, international dissemination it also seeks to contribute data to an existing project based in the United States, and with collaborators in Germany. Having established this platform, the project will also seek both to study the historical and economical impact of the coinage of Alexander and to advertise its existence and, using OPAL as a case-study, to investigate the role of such initiatives and such technology in the preservation of a heritage that transcends the national. To this end a two day conference will be organized with participants from the world of Museums, Libraries and Universities. A particular strength of the OPAL project is that it brings together the cataloguing and Linked Data strengths of a National Library with the research culture of a major University.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP504609%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The world has been shocked by recent instances of the deliberate destruction of important cultural sites, such as ISIS's destruction of the Temple of Bel in Palmyra and the shrine of Imam Awn al-Din in Mosul. In response, the UK is due to ratify the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (it is the only member of the UN Security Council, and the only major military power, not yet to have done so). The British Army is in the process of convening the Military Cultural Property Protection Working Group with the aim of developing guidelines for implementing the Convention. It should be noted that the Convention is framed in terms of 'cultural property'; we shall take this to refer to all culturally important objects, not only those that are owned. The Convention challenges the assumption, standard within the study of ethics and also just war theory, that a greater value should always be attached to the avoidance of human suffering than to the avoidance of damage to cultural property. This challenge should be welcomed, since the standard assumption does not always sit easily with our actual attitudes and actions. The urgent need to evict ISIS from Palmyra, for example, was not simply a matter of securing military advantage. Furthermore, we are familiar, in other contexts, of weighing human life and suffering against other considerations - for example, in calculating how much to spend on passenger safety on public transport. A key question for the project will be how to weigh the harm of putting combatants in danger against the benefits of protecting cultural property. Although the last ten years have seen an upsurge of philosophical interest in the ethics of war, the existing literature approaches questions of harm almost exclusively in the context of harm to life. Because the Convention puts states under an obligation to protect cultural property in war zones, there is an urgent need to apply or adapt this thinking so as to formulate principles that apply to such property. This project therefore aims to answer three central questions: 1. Under what circumstances may we intentionally or foreseeably damage sites of cultural property in war? 2. What, if anything, ought we to do to protect cultural property in conflict zones and at what cost? 3. What is the appropriate response to damaged sites of cultural property? It will involve experts on the ethics of war and on aesthetic and cultural value. These will be drawn from within academia (for example, from philosophy, archaeology, and heritage studies) and outside academia (for example, the British Museum's 'Iraq Scheme' and The West Point Military Academy). The project's findings have the potential to affect the actual conduct of war. It will help determine the circumstances in which an offensive designed to secure a military objective is rendered disproportionate by the collateral damage it will do to cultural property; or in which resources should be put towards protecting cultural property; or in which cultural property ought to be sacrificed to purely military objectives. As a corollary, it will help support public understanding about justification (or lack of justification) for engaging in war, and for conduct within war.","This project has a wide range of potential beneficiaries 1. Politicians. We aim to influence policy following the ratification of the Convention by working with Baroness Andrews, who led the UK Parliamentary debate in favour of ratifying the Convention, is on the CRG and will invite the All Party Parliamentary Group on CPP to the UK stakeholder seminar and conference to discuss how UK policy will change following ratification. Through the Norwegian Ethics Council for the Defence Sector (project partner) we will access politicians in Norway with responsibility for CPP and will have a policy seminar in Yr 1. 2.

The project responds to and aims to influence legal changes entailed by the Convention. 3 key figures involved bring considerable experience and knowledge and facilitate engagement with the legal profession - Jann Kleffner Professor of International Law at the Swedish Defence University, Adil Ahmad Haque Professor of Law at Rutgers who writes on the law and ethics of armed conflict. Expertise on UK law by project partner Nick Howe, who has considerable experience of practicing public and private international law and appearances at a UN Tribunal in The Hague. 3. Military policy-makers: The Convention requires the military to prepare for implementation; our engagement with the Military will enable direct contribution to policy. Currently charged with this for the British Army is Lieutenant-Colonel Tim Purbrick who will keep us informed of developments; through our links with the Lieutenant-Colonel we will invite them to conferences and seminars. The US military have established a CPP Unit and the US foremost Military Academy, West Point, is a project partner. Laurie W. Rush, an archaeologist employed by the US military to run the CPP unit, who is also on the US Committee of the Blue Shield (see below), has agreed to participate giving a presentation at the US conference. West Point will host a stakeholder seminar in early 2019, providing an opportunity to influence members of the US Military. Through our Norwegian project partner we will talk directly to senior members of the Norwegian military on CPP. 4. Military personnel: A crucial challenge is to bridge the gap between theory and those 'on the ground'. The practical responsibility for protection of cultural property lies with the International Committee of the Blue Shield (BS), the only organisation created and mandated under international law to preserve cultural heritage during conflict. We will work with the UK BS (Chair, Peter Stone, is on the CRG) as well as other relevant bodies (such as the military) to produce a MOOC (a Massive Open Online Course) based on training material the BS has produced for UNESCO. Within data protection constraints we will evaluate the nature of the student body and their success rates. We will raise awareness of CPP within the military by lectures and seminars to military trainees and providing information to instructors on CPP. 5. Institutions working with heritage and culture: The project will organise 2 joint events with the 'Iraq project' of the British Museum; leading practical involvement with CPP in the Middle East. The first (Yr 2) will engage c30 people from different perspectives working in CPP (archaeologists, heritage professionals, experts in the trafficking of artefacts) to inform them of current work in CPP (by the project and by the BM) and to explore bids to the Government fund for CPP. The second (Yr 3) will be a public-facing event of c100 people. We will invite key 'opinion formers' (broadcast and other media, those who teach ethics and cognate disciplines) to raise awareness of current work in CPP to make it part of the debate about the nature and justification (or not) of war. 6. NGOs: Emma Cunliffe, of Heritage for Peace, a key NGO working on CPP in Syria, is on the CRG. Through her we will identify ways in which NGOs can benefit from the progress and outcomes of the project.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP015077%2F1

The project will create the possibilities for the translation of these creative practices to forms that can circulate in the digital creative economy, through the consolidation of the learnings and skills developed in the AHRC funded project 'Using the arts to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 among India's Indigenous and Nomadic communities'. This is crucial so that the emergence of the digital as a primary cultural space, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, does not obliterate marginalised communities in terms of their livelihood, cultural heritage and identity.  During the original project, a collective of indigenous theatre practitioners and filmmakers produced a series of biweekly video-podcasts in indigenous languages bringing together artistic practices with on-ground research and documentary film making techniques to highlight the experiences and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on some of India's most marginalised groups. Drawing on this project, the follow-on funding will develop of a training module for an Indigenous Creative Leadership Programme implemented in 3 community groups, aimed at translating the creative heritage of indigenous communities, and document their realities, in a digital form. This programme will be crucial to fostering innovation and enabling the long-term sustainability of their art, livelihood and knowledge base.  The project will further generate a searchable archive of audio-visual material of the creative heritage of indigenous communities produced during the original AHRC project. This searchable archive will be given an active life through the production of a collaborative multimodal publication (including videos, photographs, stories, poetry) that will tell the stories of these communities with links to the original material. This will enable the experiences of these groups to feed into the understanding of the still unfurling human disaster of the Covid-19 pandemic, and of the structural and historical mechanisms of marginalisation of India's indigenous communities. It will also give visibility to indigenous expressions strengthening their creative economies.  Finally, the project will build on the current project to enable an exchange of experiences of similarly located groups (indigenous community groups and leaders internationally) to develop an understanding of the particularlity of the experiences of indigenous communities in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. This will be through an international conference involving indigenous communities and groups that have been addressing the implications of the pandemic on these communities, their creative practices and their place in the creative economy.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW006766%2F1

The study employs a mixture of scholarly approaches, including literary criticism, global book history, biographical writing and cultural studies. Focusing on the loosely articulated networks of literary and cultural production in the Anglophone Caribbean, the work of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation in Accra, and the mediating role played by the BBC Colonial Service, we will examine the involvement of these networks and institutions in shaping the stylistic and political contours of emerging world literatures in the twentieth century. The project aims to map out how cultural forms such as novels, poems, and short stories circulate through publishing and media channels across the globe, and the ways in which this circulation is rendered highly uneven by unequal international power relations, which are often the legacy of colonialism and imperialism. These inequalities are frequently manifested in the pressures placed on writers and artists from colonized and formerly colonized countries by publishing houses, broadcast institutions, and market forces. The project will be based around archival research into material in the Caribbean, the UK, and West Africa, much of which is relatively unexplored. This material includes transcripts, letters, and programme information relating to various radio series broadcast in the Caribbean and Ghana in the 1940s and 1950s, including 'Caribbean Voices' and 'West African Voices'. These showcased the work of authors from those regions and were important in providing access for a wider public to discussions about literary, cultural and political issues during an era in which colonial rule was ending and the prospect of national independence was on the horizon. The project is unique in that it will bring together archival material currently scattered across three continents, examining this through a global optic attentive to the uneven circulation of cultural forms. The project will make use of exclusive access to the papers, diaries, and letters of the BBC producer Henry Swanzy. Swanzy's career is indicative of the connections that existed between literary and broadcast histories across the three continents, having produced 'Caribbean Voices' between 1946-54, before becoming Head of Programmes for the Gold Coast Broadcasting System in Accra in 1954. Moreover, Swanzy's writings in his diaries provide a wealth of stories about working life both at the BBC and abroad, while also registering key cultural trends and the social and political upheavals of the post-war era. One of the principal aims of the project is to investigate how the BBC was enmeshed in the political discussions over race and immigration at the time. ""Decolonizing Voices"" will produce a series of outputs both for an academic and a wider audience, including a popular critical edition of Swanzy's memoirs, as well as scholarly writings (articles, a short monograph) on the interconnections between literary and broadcast histories informed by recent debates on world literature and the politics of literary value. Another key output of the project will be a radio programme to be broadcast on the BBC World Service and stations in the Caribbean and Ghana. The programme will examine the importance of the historical relationships between media institutions, programme makers, and literary magazine series in the era of decolonization. Our programme, in revisiting these relationships, will help to inform and enhance discussions over the function and future of public service broadcasting in a ""globalized age"". In these ways, the ""Decolonizing Voices"" project will make a vital contribution to an understanding of the relationships between literary production, the role of broadcasting as a medium of cultural expression, and the legacies of empire.","This is a wide-ranging project, the outputs of which will have several non-academic beneficiaries. Since it is in part about the history and status of the media and broadcast culture within wider society, the research is inherently imbedded in issues of public discourse beyond the academic realm. One of the main users and beneficiaries of the project will be public sector and private sector media agencies in locations across the globe, primarily the BBC, the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) and Joy FM in Accra, Ghana (JFM). ""Decolonizing Voices"" will be able to help these media agencies in their efforts to elucidate, account for and represent to the public the histories of their emergence and development. So far it has been difficult to place these histories in a coherent narrative given the fragmented and often incomplete nature of many archives. For example, much of the material relating to the BBC Colonial Service is scattered, with resources held either beyond UK shores, or in some cases in private collections. More specifically, separate parts of conversations and correspondence between contributors to Caribbean Voices is often broken up, and held on either side of the Atlantic. In addition, in both the Caribbean and West Africa the confusion and ferment of the end of colonial rule meant that archiving was rarely done systematically. This project will allow a fuller understanding of the individual histories of these national media agencies and the history of interconnection between them. This is of timely interest, as the era of ""globalization"" has led many national media organisations, involved in the global marketplace, to seek to emphasise the historic international dimensions of their operations.   Beyond the Higher Education sector, one of the project's outputs (the radio programme) may also appeal in particular to teachers in schools and colleges in the UK seeking to put together information on the history and role of the BBC as a national institution and global presence. Given the attention now paid to Black history and ""globalization"" within the national curriculum, this output may provide a useful case study in the history of cultural and political decolonization. In addition, with its emphasis on the shaping influence had by the BBC on collective debates over race, nationalism, and immigration in the post-war era, and given both the developments in new technologies and recent discussions over the role and responsibilities of the media within the public sphere, the project will appeal to culturally and politically engaged members of the public beyond the bounds of academia. There is clearly a popular audience for the topics our project covers as evidenced by the recent BBC Radio Four broadcasts about the BBC and Empire, including Colin Grant's Caribbean Voices and Razia Iqbal's World Service Writers, as well as more general programmes on Caribbean literature such as Stir it Up: 50 years of writing Jamaica (10th September, 2012). Our project's investigations would help in informing and enhancing the public debates over the function and future of public service broadcasting in a ""globalized age"". In the UK, information on the cultural history of national institutions such as public service broadcasters is relatively easily available. However, in parts of the Caribbean and West Africa this is less often the case. We envisage making such histories (of the CBC and GBC, for example) more widely accessible to local communities through specific outputs of the project. These outputs will maximise the potential international impacts of our work to as wide an audience as possible.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK007491%2F1

Cities are amongst humanity's greatest creations, and the public realm is arguably their most significant aspect. The public realm consists of networks of public spaces [e.g. squares, plazas, parks, sidewalks, paths] that are places of encounter and interaction with ""other"" bodies, cultures and ideas. While public spaces tend to be clearly defined and bounded spaces, the significance of the public realm is equally about interconnected spatial networks through the city. We need to pay greater attention to how residents perceive and experience the city through these spatial networks, and to the ways in which private realms of the city [e.g. home, work] link up to create collective urban dynamics. In addition, power relations are deeply embedded in the public realm's ongoing spatial and social production and reproduction, in its spatial manifestations, and in the ways in which it is controlled.  The most potent aspect of the public realm lies in its capacity to deliberately and creatively generate [i.e. ""design""] publics via the process of its making [i.e. ""production""]. ""Publics"" never simply exist; they are always created. Publics are created out of groups who are made and remade by the actions of other people. For example, when there is a common concern or desire that emerges [e.g. out of crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic, urban inequality, lack of affordable housing, inadequate public infrastructure], there is a call to action, and groups of people are willing to act upon those concerns or desires; a public is thereby created or ""designed."" A public is thus summoned into being.  A key aspect of this study of the public realm is understanding the role of informality. We use the term informal strategies broadly to describe a wide range of methods and techniques in the spatial production of the city. We define them as the ambiguous transactions that exist between what is acceptable and what is unacceptable in cities. Informal strategies are not marginalised practices nor are their outcomes; rather, they are central to understanding the logic of urbanism because they constitute debates about what is considered legitimate and illegitimate in the city, what is legal and illegal in the city, and with what effects. We are particularly interested in informal strategies as creative and transformative design methods and techniques developed and deployed by those who have limited financial or political resources and/or are marginalised in other ways.  The Research Network will draw insights from case study analyses of multiple types of informal strategies for producing the public realm in the global south, by paying close attention to both the specifics of differing contexts and general patterns that emerge across them. What this implies for designing the future of the public realm is that there is actually far more room for creativity than we may currently imagine, which arises from the fact that every current tradition was invented previously as a creative response to the given conditions of its time. Thus, urbanists across the spectrum-from design professionals to artist activists to ordinary citizens-always possess the radical possibility of designing new and transformative traditions for the public realm, and indeed for cities. These are the types of potentially transformative approaches to designing cities that we hope will emerge from the work of the network.

This enhances and magnifies the impact of our AHRC 'Fragmented Heritage/ Curious Travellers' methodology that combines photographic imagery (crowd-sourced/ web-scraped and new imagery) together with mobile mapping data to digitally document cultural heritage sites in context, as an approach that anticipates change, given diverse challenges that place heritage at risk.  The project will draw from Bagamoyo's rich heritage and cultural traditions, given Bagamoyo's strategic coastal location, with trading links across the Indian Ocean, past, present and future - including its boat-building traditions, role with salt production and the spice trade; the slave and ivory trade; its colonial past and linkage both with Christianity and Islam - the entry of Christianity into the interior; and with historical figures including Dr Livingstone whose body was brought to Bagamoyo upon his death in Malawi.  Digital heritage researchers and creative researchers at Bradford and St Andrews will co-create artistic works with heritage and creative researchers at the University of Dar-es-Salaam and artists at TaSUBa (Bagamoyo's Arts and Cultural Institute - Taasisi ya Sanaa na Utamaduni Bagamoyo). Training will be given in digital methods and the output will include an entry to the film shorts category at the Zanzibar International Film Festival; and a real-time portal/art installation to be showcased at the vibrant Bagamoyo Arts Festival that will link places within Tanzania (Bagamoyo on Mainland and Zanzibar Stone Towns) and between Tanzania, England and Scotland as an innovative concept and alternate form of digital twinning 'Windows Across the Oceans'. The innovative digital heritage research will enhance inclusive engagement with the creative and cultural economy in Tanzania supporting cultural heritage tourism and cultural resource management. The installations will be used to highlight the universal value of world heritage to a global audience, the importance of conserving cultural heritage settings (townscape heritage, maritime heritage) to both local people and government in Tanzania and the linked understanding and meaning that comes from oral histories, craft traditions and other rich narratives. The project facilitates knowledge exchange and capacity building throughout, crucially involving TZ researchers to spend time in the UK, developing digital heritage skills to work with the Bagamoyo data, with additional financial support/ value-added from Erasmus+ funded activity As a result , with researchers from UDSM we will co-create a digital twin for the Historic City of Bagamoyo (on the UNESCO tentative world heritage list) and as part of this, generate Google StreetView-ready content to raise visibility for townscape heritage and to support local businesses.  The digital twin will serve as a framework to unite Bagamoyo's tangible heritage (buildings, port and boat-building tradition, landscapes/ seascapes), and intangible narratives (stories, songs, cultural practices and craft knowledge) to help to document past and present way of life. The new, vibrant digital assets that are created through this project will 1) support local tour guides (helping to increase visibility as a tourism destination; and by creating digital resources that can enhance the tourism experience); 2) promote global citizenship and foster good community relations (helping to educate people, develop place-making and enhance civic pride); 3) develop use of IT through methods that support digital discovery (hidden heritage); 4) improve accessibility (equality, diversity and inclusion); 5) provide methods for long term monitoring of change to sites by heritage guardians.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW006723%2F1

CARE starts from the hypothesis that care as a practice can be understood to have an aesthetic dimension - that is a crafted, sensory and embodied character. The project explores how we might understand care in new ways if we attend to its aesthetics, and how we might understand arts practices in new ways if we ask how they contribute to interhuman care. Drawing on care ethicists' analysis of interdependent human relations as a foundation for a situated version of social justice, the project asks how an attention to care aesthetics might provide new insights and new practices that run counter to the inequalities of a sometimes careless society. Investigating how care operates in contemporary socially engaged arts practice, with particular attention to applied theatre projects, the research asks how a focus on care aesthetics provides new approaches to these practices. Simultaneously, working with health and social care researchers, the project will investigate a range of contemporary social and health care practices, to examine how a focus on aesthetics might revaluate the skills of staff who are often at the forefront of the crises that exist in health and social care settings. If institutional care has become overly instrumental and technically focused, the project asks how a reorientation to embodied and sensory practices by care practitioners will offer new approaches with the potential to improve the quality of care in different settings. The research in social and health settings and the analysis in socially engaged arts contexts will cross-pollinate with researchers from the arts working in the former and researchers from health and social care contributing to the latter. This will include an extended case study on care aesthetics and coronavirus which will document the responses to the pandemic that exist both in a care and artistic register, to examine how a focus on the aesthetics of interhuman caring relations might illuminate powerful community-based means for dealing with the difficulties of the crisis. The project will establish the Care Aesthetics Lab in year one to act as the engagement and dissemination vehicle for the research and enable the development of exploratory practices that will bring multidisciplinary teams of professionals, artists, educationalists and researchers together, including opportunities for broader public and practitioner engagement. It will ensure involvement of practitioner communities in the process of research and help develop new approaches informed by care aesthetics, meeting the urgency of our contemporary crisis in care.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW003104%2F1

It will also break new ground in paying sustained attention to both distinctive aspects of the experience and effects of abuse in this context - as well as processes of repair, restitution and recovery - using survivor experiences as the basis of its investigation. Structured around seven inter-related pieces of research, the project will constitute a step-change for research in this field by bringing together an experienced multi-disciplinary research team with extensive contacts with survivors of abuse. The core project team will include senior researchers in the study of religion, specialists in psychological, legal and policy issues on abuse in religious organisations, and others with substantial experience of working with survivors of abuse across a range of religious traditions. In addition to generating new knowledge, disseminated through a range of traditional academic outputs, the project will also produce a wide range of other resources for individual survivors and for groups working with them, policy-makers, safeguarding professionals, faith communities and those involved in the education and training of religious leaders. The project will lead to the production of a landmark edited volume on religion and abuse that will become a key point of reference in this field, as well as other edited and authored books and articles, reports, films and podcasts, and training materials for leaders and safeguarding staff in statutory and religious organisations. In bringing together a range of individuals with expertise in this field in the UK and internationally, the project will also consolidate national and international networks which will continue to undertake research and engagement activities beyond the life of this project. The project will build on the substantial body of material on abuse in religious contexts generated through the work of major national inquiries such as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA). Whilst there is no conclusive evidence of abuse being any more prevalent in religious organisations than wider society, these inquiries have drawn on substantial submissions from religious organisations, survivors and other stakeholders, and on unprecedented access to records of religious organisations, to argue that factors specific to religious organisations contribute to conditions in which abuse has taken place and poor institutional responses to abuse are made. With a number of our project team already having been involved in the work of national abuse inquiries and other relevant bodies, this project will build on this analysis to establish in greater depth how the cultures and structures of religious organisations inter-sect with abuse, how public policy and safeguarding practice can best respond to abuse in these settings and what aspects of survivors' experience are particular to these religious contexts. The project's contribution to this field will also result from its more substantial engagement with theoretical approaches and substantive knowledge from the study of religion which will bring new perspectives to the existing, primarily social-scientific, literature in this field at present.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW003112%2F1

The research asks how ideas about the natural world contributed to the development of early cinema and how nature continues to inform the medium today. Ideas about cinema's ability (and limitations) to convey a non-anthropocentric perspective are at the heart of the project, whose eco-aesthetic focus is intimately linked to topical questions about the status of nature as an economic and aesthetic resource. Other themes that will be explored are the question of nonhuman agency, climate change, sustainability, and human-animal relations.  The network showcases a programme of rarely seen moving image work, from early archival pieces to recent film and video work, with the aim of broadening the scope of debate on representations of the natural world beyond popular natural history broadcasting (e.g. the BBC's Planet Earth or Frozen Planet). The network will bring together stakeholders across several disciplines: Film Studies, ecology, philosophy, film and arts practice, cultural studies, as well as the general public.  The first series of events will take place on 7-8 September 2012 at the Whitstable Biennale. This is the first time that an academic symposium and a themed series of screenings form an integral part of the Biennale, establishing an innovative crossover network between academics, artists, and the public. The Whitstable events will open with the Symposium Screening Nature held at the Horsebridge Arts & Community Centre, with confirmed keynotes by the renown scholars W.J.T. Mitchell (University of Chicago) and Claire Colebrook (Penn State), and invited speakers, ecocritic Greg Garrard (Bath Spa), historian Jonathan Burt (author of Animals in Film), and media and cultural studies scholar Jodi Berland (York University). The Symposium is followed by six curated Flora & Fauna screenings featuring a mixture of early film and contemporary artist film, video and sound works that deal with the relationship between ecology, nature, and the image. Screenings will include Question & Answers with the filmmakers and artist panel discussions, resulting in a comprehensive dialogue among filmgoers, visitors to the Biennale, academics, and artists. The second series of events (November '12-January '13) will be at the Goethe-Institut London, and include two public premieres of award-winning documentaries on ecology's place in the wider political and social context. The screenings will also be followed by a discussion between the filmmakers, film scholars, and the public. Two additional symposia in 2013 will complete this phase of the network's research and pave the way for its future work. By linking a wide range of communities, including local residents, visitors to the Whitstable Biennale, filmgoers, academics, activists, and artists, the project centres on fostering a genuine intersectional dialogue on the place of nature in film and the historical, political, and everyday consequences of the media circulation of natural images. The recent surge in natural history TV programming, commercial documentaries (e.g. March of the Penguins), or the BFI's DVD release of Secrets of Nature suggests a growing appetite to explore a wider range of nature filmmaking. The network harnesses this appetite to exhibit and debate historically crucial filmic materials (early scientific and exploration films, contemporary artist film and video, and experimental film), all of which offer fascinating counterpoints to popular wildlife filmmaking. The network sets out to bridge the gap between art, academia, and public engagement. Thus, the network seeks to make a concrete intervention into existing conversations on nature's place within a diverse film culture at a time of ecological crisis.","Central to this project is an engagement with arts and cultural institutions (the Whitstable Biennale, Goethe-Institut), artists and film practitioners, academics, and non-academic communities interested in the intersection of film and the environment. As part of the Whitstable Biennale, the Symposium is open to the public, visitors to the Biennale, local residents, and members of the academic community. The six screenings are similarly geared towards a wide and diverse audience and include discussions with the audience and the filmmakers as an integral part. The accompanying brochure, Screening Nature Network website, and Facebook page will include details on the screenings as well as a non-specialist writing designed to provide the key concepts and ideas of the project.  Our aim is to enhance the exposure and profile of eco-aesthetics and ecocritical moving image work on the relationship between humans and their nonhuman surroundings, as well as generate mutually beneficial interchanges between communities and disciplines. We are committed to exchanges that draw on, disseminate, and develop existing ideas about environment and creative practice; we see the project as a launching pad for a more focused, long-term forum for conversation, action, and research on nature and art within institutions like the Whitstable Biennale, cultural institutions, online communities, academia, and the filmgoing public. As such, the network is an essentially democratic and democratizing framework for debates around the topical issue of the stakes of nature in film.  The network is set up to catalyze creative dialogue about ways in which inter-sector ecological and artistic activities may be used to benefit future communities and the cultural institutions serving those communities, be it a local institution like the Whitstable Biennale or a larger international cultural institution in London like the Goethe-Institut. The choice to hold a major series of events outside of London is part of our commitment to local public events that engage the local community as well as draw sections of the London art scene outside of the capital. As a first installment of what we hope will continue in a variety of formats in the future, in the UK and abroad, the research has potential to make a significant contribution to ecological-cultural initiatives, which are already gaining prominence on the small screen and beyond.  To ensure the project's continuation and upkeep, we will build and maintain a Screening Nature Network website and Facebook page, a useful, flexible, and efficient way of growing the community, advertising and promoting future events, and carrying on a dialogue on the network's research themes. An online presence is a vital dissemination tool and key to the network's future life beyond the specific award.  The network will benefit users and participants by:  * Interacting with local communities on the value of (small scale, affordable, even home-made) creative practice on the theme of nature and the environment.  * Fostering a dialogue with non-academic participants in ecological/ artistic interest groups, enriching the ways in which the relevance of nature to creative practice is understood and implemented.  * Introducing public audiences, academics, and filmmakers/artists to a rarely seen coherent body of work on the subject of moving image and the environment.  * Providing an online platform for public/ communal discussion on ecology, art, and the moving image.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK001965%2F1

Recent synthetic studies, including by the joint PIs, challenge what has long been the textbook understanding of the collapse of Roman rule and the impact of the Muslim conquests in North Africa, in which the eighth and ninth centuries have often been seen as a dark age. Ongoing excavations by the PIs at the important, neighbouring urban centres of Simitthus (Chimtou) and Bulla Regia (Hammam Darraji) in NW Tunisia directed by von Rummel and Fenwick respectively, have highlighted the complexity of urban trajectories, technological innovation and environmental change in the medieval period. The proposed project will build on these findings, addressing a fundamental gap in our understanding of cultural, economic and landscape transformations in medieval North Africa. Moving beyond the simple question of urban continuity or collapse in late antiquity and the early medieval period, it will investigate the extent to which the Muslim conquests and subsequent regime change represented a force of economic and social transformation. This will be assessed by tracking long-term changes in settlement patterns, landscape use, patterns of exploitation and technology in the central Medjerda valley, the famed granary of Roman and Islamic Africa. The project will evaluate five sites with different trajectories in the medieval period: Bulla Regia (Hammam Darraji), Simitthus (Chimtou), Thunusuda (Bordj Hallal), Belalis Maior (Henchir El-Faouar) and Vaga (Béja), conducting topographic and geophysical survey in order to identify suitable zones for excavation. Following this evaluation, the sites will be targeted with a systematic sampling strategy aimed at recovering a stratified material culture sequence and a high density of plant and animal remains associated with occupation sequences. Environmental data will be extracted from the sites' hinterlands to understand changing climatic and environmental conditions. This data will be synthesized with relevant Latin, Greek and Arabic sources to assess the full extent of the transformation resulting from the Muslim conquest of North Africa, subsequent regime change and the spread of Islam. The results will be contextualized within broader trends in the Mediterranean and the Islamic world which characterize the 'first Islamic millennium'. This project will ultimately result in both a fundamental advance of our understanding of Islamic North Africa and a new interpretative framework which can be applied to other regions of the Islamic world.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT012692%2F1

Our focus is on how sonic interaction shapes early modern identities. From the chiming of the clock regulating the daily patterns of the city, to the bell calling all to church, the itinerant ballad hawker singing the ballads they wanted to sell, and the literate reading pamphlets to the illiterate, sounds governed everyday life. The network will explore how sounds create communities, civil society, sociability and ways of knowing and understanding the wider world and the self. We will consider how under-explored music was performed in particular places and spaces. We will unearth sensory stories of the past and how they connect with the soundscape. The project will extend our understanding of early printed texts, music and sites where sounds are heard: it will make knowledge of them available to a wider community, and foster opportunities for future collaborations. The network will organise three interdisciplinary workshops, an international conference and commission an electroacoustic composition that recreates the sounds of the past. We will also organise public events in collaboration with our partners; the National Trust, the Wellcome Collection and the University of British Columbia. The workshops will be centred around three key topics and how they relate to sound: theory, space, archives. Practice-led events such as practical demonstrations and skills-set sharing will be included in the workshops and in the conference. We will also establish a blog where approaches to soundscapes can be developed and ideas shared. Network members will contribute podcasts, written reports from events and online resources that will be of interest to academic and non-academic audiences.  The major academic intervention in the field that the project will make is to develop a fully multidisciplinary understanding of what the 'soundscape' is and how this broadens our understanding of every day life in the early modern period.","Our impact activities are linked directly to the series of planned workshops and to the final international conference; these activities include a performance (workshop 1 and conference); a public lecture (workshop 2 and conference) and blog posts on selected items from the Wellcome Collection (workshop 3). The public lectures will be filmed and made available, along with an explanatory commentary, on the project blog. This forms a key part of our impact activity, and will reach a global audience through being promoted on social media. Network members will also be asked to commit material to the blog to ensure that it is regularly updated. In so doing, we will accumulate a rich archive of materials that seek to uncover the sounds of the past. Alongside the recordings of public lectures, we will also conduct interviews with network members and partners and supply case studies that will make for a dynamic and absorbing reception history. In collaboration with Speke Hall and the National Trust, we will organise a series of events on the soundscape of the country house, with particular reference to Speke Hall's recusant past. We will commission an electoacoustic composer to record sounds at Speke Hall and produce a composition and performance that will enable us to engage with the sounds of the past through novel and invigorating performances. These events will help us to explore the three key topics of the network and enable the general public to reflect more carefully about noise and how we listen to sounds. We have already established contact with the National Trust, the Wellcome Collection and the University of British Columbia and we will run events in collaboration with each of these partners. The network aims to consolidate these links and to identify new partners and beneficiaries.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS004831%2F1

Surveys are used, for example, in staff development, professional training, product design and testing, and in various forms of service provision across the public and private sector. Surveys and questionnaires often produce a combination of quantitative and qualitative forms of data. Quantitative forms, such as rating scales (e.g. likert scale responses), multiple choice questions and rank order questions can be numerated (i.e. quantified) with ease, the analysis of which can be conducted in a systematic and often automated way. By contrast, more qualitative questions, which prompt open ended, free-text comment responses, or, in the context of the tourism and heritage sector, written feedback from exhibitions, events and/or historical sites on social media channels or websites including Trip Advisor and Trust Pilot, pose a more difficult challenge for the analyst. Tackling written, text-based feedback often requires a more labour-intensive and manual approach to analysis. Compounding this challenge is where feedback is presented in both English and Welsh, as is often the case in Wales, with Wales representing the largest bilingual community in the UK. The successful analysis of bilingual data relies on the workforce having the appropriate linguistic expertise to process it. While a range of sophisticated digital tools for the analysis of text-based data are available, particularly for researchers working in academia, in marketing and public relations contexts etc., many of the digital resources used are not necessarily affordable, quick and easy to use, and/or accessible to non-expert users. Specifically, these tools currently do not fully support the task of systematically processing free-text responses in Welsh. This project aims to bridge this gap by building the novel 'FreeTxt' toolkit which is designed to support the analysis and visualisation of multiple forms of open-ended, free-text data in both English and Welsh. FreeTxt will draw on existing open-source bilingual corpus-based utilities and methodologies, repackaging these and taking them in a new direction so that they are relevant to new audiences/user-groups. We will work closely with project partners Cadw and National Trust Wales to co-design, co-construct and test FreeTxt to ensure that the resource is fit-for-purpose and fairly and consistently meets the needs of Welsh and English-language responses. Existing tools that we will draw on include those developed as part of the CorCenCC project (Corpws Cenedlaethol Cymraeg Cyfoes - The National Corpus of Contemporary Welsh). This includes CorCenCC's semantic (i.e. meaning based categorisations of individual words and phrases) and part of speech (POS - i.e. grammar-based categorisations of individual words and phrases - e.g. nouns, verbs) taggers and tagsets for Welsh language, and corpus functionalities for the querying of language, amongst others. These tools will be integrated into a user-friendly, online interface that users can paste/upload their texts into, to search for patterns of meaning that emerge in survey responses and feedback; to see which words are most often used in relation to a given theme, place, topic; to understand what visitors particularly enjoyed about a service or attraction, and what they think could be improved. The final version of the tool will be made freely-available and will be adaptable in terms of who can use it and when. It will contain generic analysis features that enable it to be used by any public and/or professional company and institution dealing with varying datasets of qualitative survey data and will be of relevance to academic researchers analysing and visualising survey data. The accessibility and usability of this tool will help provide a direct route to potential impact.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW004844%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Art at the Start have been offering arts therapy and messy play sessions to promote the health and wellbeing of parents and 0-3 year old infants in art galleries across Scotland, supported by the Mobilising Cultural and Natural Assets to Combat Health Inequalities scheme. During our project, we have managed to reach families who don't traditionally visit art galleries and have helped parents who have had difficulties bonding with their children to connect to their children in the context of shared art making. We have evidenced positive changes in the quality of family wellbeing via questionnaires, interviews and observations of family interactions which focus on the experience of the infant. By tailoring provision to local needs and demographics, and specifically seeking to engage under-served communities (minoritized ethnic groups, those living in poverty, young mothers, infants), we have actively broken down established barriers to accessing the arts. Our project has been listed as an example of best public health practise and won several public engagement prizes. Our team are active in the UK wide movement to support infant mental health. The NHS rely on community spaces to help them provide the first line of support for families with young children who are struggling with their wellbeing, but don't yet qualify for urgent clinical care. However, there is a lack of guidance concerning how community providers and NHS stakeholders can work together to deliver early interventions effectively and sustainably. Government think-tanks across the UK agree that it is critical to improve links between community services and mental health services for infants and their families within the NHS, including testing and evaluating models for future service development. Giving children the best start in life is important, because our parents teach us how to interact with others, and the love they provide is essential for us to develop academic and social competence. Poor starts in life can be passed down through generations, and early years interventions offer a way to break this cycle. Critically, since both early relationships and access to the arts have been shown to have protective benefits for health and wellbeing throughout the lifespan, art-based early years interventions stand to have a long-term impact on the lives of the families they reach.  The proposed research reflects on whether art-based approaches can be embedded within arts venues as a referral route for infant mental health provision in the UK, ensuring early access to the health benefits of arts. We propose to bring together academics working in psychology, art therapy, arts & health, arts education and midwifery with a range of non-academic stakeholders, including families, family arts and support organisations, arts galleries and NHS infant mental health teams. Led by a community parent researcher and a participation officer from a charity which supports parents, we would aim to evaluate the experiences and needs of families who may benefit from the health and wellbeing outcomes of a community embedded art & health service. Supported by an interdisciplinary team of academics and clinicians, a family arts organisation, and representatives from art galleries and third sector and NHS infant mental health teams, our research team would map existing art-based interventions for early years relationships across the UK. Case studies from two clinicians based within infant mental health teams in Scotland would help to inform the challenges of embedding such services in an NHS context. By facilitating knowledge exchange between this interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary network of academics, clinicians, families, cultural organisations and government and NHS structures, our ultimate aim is to co-produce a research 'road map' to allow for strategic reshaping of cultural assets in the service of public health, targeting the foundations of mental wellbeing.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX005917%2F1

Until now, the vast majority of such displays, built around large artefacts such as rocket engines and satellites, have told a predominantly technological story. The possibility of a broader, more culturally-rich, interpretation was signalled by the Science Museum's widely-praised 'Cosmonauts' temporary exhibition in 2015, a display that rooted the Russian space effort's origins in much older Russian cultural traditions, notably the idea of 'Cosmism', popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Such an approach enabled the display of a much wider range of artefacts and art works than would be normal for a space display. It also led to a much wider visiting demographic than space displays usually attract.  The success of this exhibition throws down a challenge to curators about how such a broad cultural approach to space exploration could be applied to the next generation of 'permanent' (ie with a 25+ year life) space displays, including the one we plan to open in the next decade. The Science Museum Group, an IRO since 2009, sees research activity as core to developing its professional practice (see: https://group.sciencemuseum.org.uk/our-work/research-public-history/research-strategy-2018/). A significant aspect of that approach involves the convening of multidisciplinary networks such as this to develop discourse around museum problematics that might also stimulate academic reflection and new directions in research. In this case, space scientists (via the European Space Agency, our hosts for the second meeting) will mingle with historians and science studies academics; space psychologists and physiologists with art historians; anthropologists with science fiction scholars. The meetings will be staged first to consider the current form of museum representation of space exploration with its presence in other media; second, the diversity of participants in - and audiences for - space exploration, as well as the diversity of disciplines that study it; and the third will aim to create a synthesis of the previous discussions. Outputs will include a report and presentation for the Museum's masterplanning review group and at least one summary article (for submission to a museum studies journal) as well as conference presentations. The major long-term dissemination will be the redeveloped Science Museum space gallery, which will be visited by millions of people. This will be accompanied by a catalogue, containing essays by many of the network participants.","Museum researchers and curators will benefit from the Culture-Space research network through its pioneering new approaches of placing scientific and technological displays into a broader, culturally relevant, context. This new methodology will flow onto the broader public via the new space gallery at the Science Museum - reaching millions of visitors. The emphasis on increasing the diversity of space cultures represented also promises significant engagement of new demographics in the contemplation of space exploration.  Traditionally, space galleries have a perception of being of interest only to those predisposed to the technical or scientific elements of space exploration. Yet, by reframing the subject within a more human and cultural perspective we will engage a wider range of the public. In the first instance, this includes the museum's daytime visitors comprised of school groups, science, engineering and technology enthusiasts, cultural consumers, lay-historians, and domestic and international tourists. Additionally, as a permanent gallery, the new space display will extend to visitors that attend our ""Lates"" sessions. These visitors diversify those who will be directly impacted by the research, and includes young adults, professionals, trend-adopters, and entertainment seekers. The research network's artistic and creative participants will benefit from connecting to contemporary space scientists, engineers, social science and humanities scholars, as well as the unique objects from the Science Museum's collections. We envisage the artists and creative professionals will be inspired by these interactions to produce new and exciting works. Importantly, because these network participants have the capacity to mediate society's interaction with human-space activities, they will also help broaden the benefits of a culturally centric perspective of space beyond the confines of the network and Museum. Further, British and international space organisations, such as the European Space Agency (ESA) with whom the Museum is partnered here, will be able to build, cultivate and maintain strong relationships with public sentiment to understand how society values their contributions, as well as discover new pathways to generate interest in their current and historical space activities. In addition, the existing social sciences research programmes administered by international space organisations will benefit from building new collaborations with university social sciences researchers.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS012907%2F1

Its key objective is to review a wide range of existing research in order to better understand the myriad ways in which arts and culture are seen as capable of achieving 'urban regeneration', and the ways in which 'cultural value' is constructed in research which seeks to evaluate this regeneration.  A typology will be created which will combine:  - An assessment of the diverse forms of cultural value which 'regenerative' activities seek to create (is 'regeneration', for example, achieved by intervening in the built environment? Promoting new cultural businesses? Increasing tourism? Attracting new audiences? Encouraging 'grassroots' community activity?) - An examination of the methodological approaches taken in assessing this value (are audience surveys carried out? Participants interviewed? Expert opinion sought? Economic impact statements created?) - A critique of the efficacy of these approaches (who uses these research findings? What arguments do they support? Are these robust?) In critically assessing methodological approaches to evidence-gathering, this project thus seeks to examine how particular constructions of value in the discourse concerning culture and urban regeneration are formulated with reference to a range of influential contextual factors (including public policy, the type of arts and cultural activity being evaluated, the circumstances of the commissioning of research, and the available resources to develop evidence). It also aims to identify existing strengths and weaknesses (or gaps) in current understanding, and suggest ways in which improved understanding may be achieved, and so articulate a more nuanced understanding of the factors at play in understanding the role of 'culture' in urban regeneration.  Crucially, this reviewing process seeks to understand interventions in this area not just from a critical theoretical and methodological perspective, but also from a practitioner viewpoint. As so much evidence gathering occurs beyond the realms of the academy, sustained engagement with evaluations and other documentary evidence produced by external practitioners throughout the project is considered to be vital to achieving a rounded understanding of this area, and also in ensuring that the findings from this project are disseminated beyond the academic context.",This section not required under the terms and conditions of the call.

"Funding details                                                                                                              With its focus on expanding impact and engagement from a previous research grant, Performing Local Places will use arts practices to improve the living environments of two sets of people in two geographical areas of need in UK: Camden (London) and Oldham (Greater Manchester). Findings from these projects will be disseminated and publicised to all local authorities in the UK, promoting a new mode of service delivery for enhancing health and wellbeing in complex living environments .  Project participants will be within the oversight and services of local authorities and councils will be helping to broker the activity within their provider frameworks. The arts practices comprise a cultural product called 'Performing Place' which has been developed and tested in previous practical research projects with vulnerable groups affiliated with, and engaged via, arts organisations. Building on that project, in this new development we have consulted on priority areas within local councils who have identified a future need for such work. Two practical projects will be planned, one in Camden and one in Oldham, working between Arts leaders and other departments, Mental Health in Camden and Stronger Communities in Oldham. Both the planning and delivery period will include working with local council representatives, key workers and leading artist/facilitator practitioners with the new end users.   In Camden we will work in at least one Council-owned area of the Supported Living Programme, in buildings that house those with need of 'stepping stone' support to live more independently and whose cultural engagement may also be at the lower end of the spectrum within the Borough (which is an indicator of health and wellbeing). We will run 15 weekly sessions based in the residences, engaging adults with their current and potential 'place'.   In Oldham, we will work in the ward of Clarksfield with long-term residents and comparatively newly arrived Roma residents, assuaging disharmonies arising from different cultural understandings within the same local community. This work will follow a different model of Performing Place practice - a week's intensive engagement rather than weekly, workshops (as in Camden) - and will take place over a week in the summer of 2016.   In the planning and delivery of the projects, we will work with specialist lead facilitators following and adapting models used in the previous project, 'Challenging concepts of ""liquid"" place through performing practices in community contexts', 2011-2014 (Challenging Place). Such activities will include a range of improvisation and performance-related activities that are shaped from everyday operations and behaviours. None of the participants are likely to be performers but the activities are non-threatening, accessible and shaped to raise levels of cultural engagement where there may be existing barriers. This is an important part of Performing Place, that it can be accessed by participants without particular skill or experience in performance. (See http://www.performingplaces.org/placepracsitesotw.html for example.)   The impact and engagement of these two follow-on projects will be formally documented in line with local authority reporting and disseminated via simple web pages on the existing site, three symposia and a 32-page document (with executive summary). This document will be sent to the 400+ local authorities in the UK with the intention that such practice be promoted and assimilated for use in other priority areas. Two symposia will take place in London and Manchester with representatives from all nearby local authority councils invited, as well as nationally. A third symposium will take place for the 33 members of London Arts Forum.","This Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement project will increase the effectiveness and impact of public services and influence policy by demonstrating an enhancement to the quality of life of participants through their creative engagement. Impact can be summarised in the following areas: - Programme beneficiaries.  Each of the two sets of participants is expected to benefit directly from the practical projects, reporting changes in attitude to place, aspirations and wellbeing. In Camden, residents will be those previously unable to live on their own (such as those with mental health issues, learning difficulties or lack of confidence) and in Supported Living. Many will have been homeless. Performing Place activities are designed as non-threatening 'extensions' to the everyday where performative activities will be guided by skilled artist facilitators to increase independence in new or existing places. Findings from the previous project suggest that such activities will develop new place attachments. In Clarksfield, Oldham, impact will be supported by local community leading figures from different cultures in Oldham. Participants from approximately five streets in Clarksfield will take part in a week-long performing place project which will be promoted to the surrounding areas to increase public engagement and footfall for wider safer neighbourhood impact and profile-raising. Within this project a range of activities will take place that invite residents to re-envision their physical locality, subverting it, enriching it in people's minds through 'performing' it and, subsequently, creating a 'plural' neighbourhood where different cultural behaviours are accepted by longer term residents. - Local authorities We are looking to establish a blueprint and advocate a step-change in public service delivery frameworks and how the two councils may consider Performing Place in partnership with other areas of the public agenda priority areas (e.g. regeneration, health and wellbeing). This is with a longer term view to placing it at strategic planning and commissioning level. As a key to service enhancement and individual and community ownership, we anticipate Performing Place becoming a useful contributor to achieving local authority targets as will be evidenced in Camden and Oldham. With the dissemination of a final report document nationally, and following the summative symposia in London and Manchester, we are committed to extending this work further. - Arts practitioners. PI Mackey will work alongside arts facilitators who have experience in her Performing Place activities and facilitating work with participants from the previous projects. Together, they will 'train' further facilitator practitioners to work in this way, utilising documentation gathered from the previous projects in Challenging Place. Those with experience will benefit from passing on skills as well as further experimentation opportunities. Those new to some of the techniques and thinking will learn new ideas and how to work with these in less familiar (and challenging) public contexts. It is anticipated that this network of practitioners will be extended in future projects. - Service Providers It is expected that service providers will be exposed to the performing place cultural offer in the short space of the project. This will promote the longer-term use and function of specialised arts interventions as a way of supporting holistic council efficiencies (e.g. decreasing the period needed for adults to remain in supported living projects will be explicit). It is anticipated that voluntary and community sector key workers will actively pursue such projects in consultation with their authority, as well as network about the impact and the benefits of the work with the participants, thus leading to expanded opportunities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN007816%2F1

The country's infrastructure was destroyed, family memory ruptured and Rwandan society left severely wounded. Survivor testimony and artistic explorations of the past play key roles in opening up new ways to remember genocide and explore post-conflict identities. However, in the aftermath of genocide, many stories were told by outsiders with little understanding of Rwanda's cultural and historical complexity. Zoe Norridge's leadership fellowship Stories from Rwanda explored creative interdisciplinary approaches to foregrounding Rwandan voices in narratives about the genocide against the Tutsi. This grant supported, amongst other elements, the translation of Yolande Mukagasana's survivor testimony Not My Time to Die, writing and photography workshops with Rwandan artists, and a special issue of Wasafiri on Human Rights Cultures. During this fellowship the PI and partners identified two unanticipated challenges: 1) A concern that foregrounding survivor voices fails to empower Rwandans if survivors are not also in positions to lead testimonial projects. Too often survivors feel their stories are instrumentalised and retold in manners that make them uncomfortable and may cause pain. 2) The realisation that there is a significant gap in UK resources for teaching the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. This is in part because, unlike the Holocaust, more recent genocides are not in the national curriculum. With the exception of Ishami Foundation materials, resources that do exist don't tend to involve survivors in their conceptualisation or delivery.  This follow-on-funding proposal responds to these challenges by drawing on AHRC-funded research insights into the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and arts-based approaches in foregrounding Rwandan voices. Much of the work centres around 100 Stories, a collection of testimony from survivors, alongside stories from other Rwandans including rescuers, children of survivors and genocide perpetrators. Led by artist and genocide survivor Jo Ingabire Moys, these stories foreground significant moments from past and present, grounded in sensual and emotional detail, that offer wider insights on genocide. Showcasing survivor leadership, Norridge has supported this project since its inception and now seeks to assist Ingabire in collecting fifty new stories and moving onto a new project: editing and publishing the whole collection as a paperback book. This builds on her existing relationship with Rwanda's Huza Press who have agreed to publish the work. Together, the team will develop collaborative methodologies for editing the stories and build expertise amongst Rwandan publishing professionals in the areas of cover design and editing testimony.  The complete survivor-led collection of 100 Stories will offer a valuable resource for UK teachers. To facilitate their use in UK classrooms, the PI, postdoc and Ishami Foundation's CEO Eric Murangwa Eugene MBE (also a genocide survivor) will work alongside Genocide80Twenty at Hampton School, to map ways in which educators currently draw on Rwandan survivor testimony and develop resources to support teachers working with written and in-person testimony in the classroom. All the 100 Stories projects in the UK and Rwanda are supported by UK-based Rwandan survivor and mental health specialist Philomene Uwamaliya. She will also assist with the development of advisory guidelines for NGOs and genocide educators, in the UK and Rwanda, on collaborative working with survivors when producing materials featuring genocide testimony. These active collaborations producing new materials for new audiences will support genocide education whilst also giving survivors more ownership over the ways in which their stories are used.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX005402%2F1

The network generated a valuable dialogue between 4 university nodes (Plymouth, Lund, Leiden and Western Australia) and curators and research department at the V&A, and practice professionals at Skarhult Castle, Sweden, Museum of London, and Cultural Heritage Leiden, and previously has secured significant funding from the University of Lund and the Swedish Research Council. The follow-on funding would further enhance the existing partnership with the V&A, and allow us to work with a major new international partner, the Vasa Museum, Stockholm, which is reorganising the ways in which they think of gender in relation to their collections and museology practices. Both of the museums as well as Lund University have promised to provide match-funding for the proposed project, and see it as delivering significant wider impact in terms of knowledge exchange. As a result of workshops over the past two years in collaboration with our non-HEI partners we developed an interpretative methodology for understanding objects, exhibitions and the past through the lens of gender, power and materiality that revealed the ways in which gendered power clusters influenced decision-making in the form and function of objects. A powerful outcome of the network has been a raising of the awareness of gender (which encompasses women and men, femininities and masculinities, sexualities and identities) as an important interpretive category within the museum environment, and the role this can play in generating diverse narratives that have wider societal impact disseminated through curatorial practice, and educational and public programming in its broadest sense, as a way of stimulating changes in behaviour. We are therefore seeking to work with two international beacon institutions in order to integrate gender better into narratives of the past and present.  The project the team (Daybell (PI), Norrhem (International CI), Susan Broomhall, Nadine Akkerman and Jacqueline Van Gent; at the Vasa Mirja Arnshav, Research Co-ordinator and Fred Hocker, Head of Research, and at the V&A, Joanna Norman, Head of Research, Elaine Tierney, Research Fellow, and Assistant Curators Dawn Hoskins and Zorian Clayton) would work with collaborating partners (including a network of Swedish heritage professionals led by Dr Pia Laskar, a Swedish gender historian/researcher) in order to coproduce with museum professionals gendered pathways and interpretation of the collections and permanent exhibitions at the V&A and Vasa.  The project activities will have several strands:  1) To develop gendered interpretative pathways through the permanent exhibitions and collections at the V&A and Vasa by identifying and researching 10-20 objects in each museum. 2) Co-production of public engagement dissemination activities and materials through a range of deliverables, including public talks, dialogue events, education packages, self-guided interpretative materials, podcasts and short film. A key aim of these activities is to reach out to new audiences defined by the partner institutions. 3) Two Knowledge Exchange events in London and Stockholm with the project team and museum practice professionals (curators, cataloguers, conservators, education and outreach and public programming) at the V&A and Vasa, and other non-HEI collaborating institutions. These events have two aims: to coproduce further the gendered pathways and interpretive materials in each institution; and to facilitate knowledge exchange of the conceptual implications of gendered interpretive pathways between international institutions. 4) Working with V&A, Vasa and a network of Swedish museums to produce of model of best practice to disseminate among Swedish museums and generate interntational knowledge exchange.","We have identified a wide range of non-academic beneficiaries who will derive different kinds of impact generated by this follow-on funding project. These include: i) Museums and heritage sites in the UK, Sweden and The Netherlands. Each of the three European HEI 'nodes' at Plymouth, Lund and Leiden has identified a series of local partner institutions as end-users for the research deriving from this follow-on funding project with the V&A and Vasa, with whom relationships are already established and which we would like to further develop. In the UK, this will include the Victoria and Albert Museum (Joanna Norman, Head of Research, and Elaine Tierney, Research Fellow, are both members of the project team); in Sweden, the Vasa Museet (Mirja Arnshav, Research Co-ordinator and Fred Hocker, Head of Research are both members of the project team) and Skarhults kulturminne, which hosts the Den Dolda Kvinnomakten ('The Hidden Power of Women') exhibition, and its owner Baroness Alexandra von Schwerin, as well as a network of Swedish State Museums co-ordinated by the Swedish Gender Consultant Dr Pia Laskar, who is a collaborating partner of the project; and in The Netherlands, the Allard Pierson Museum, Amsterdam.  ii) curators, cataloguers, conservators, education and public outreach practitioners and specialists working in the Heritage industries in the UK, Sweden and The Netherlands. iii) visitors to museums, including the V&A and Vasa, and their target audiences (the Vasa had a record 1.3 million visitors last year, a large proportion of which were international; while the V&A had over 3 million). iv) educators (teachers and lecturers) and school children and undergraduate students. v) the Swedish government and Department of Education.  The ways in which these non-academic end-users will benefit from the impact of research produced by the follow-on funding project is wide-ranging and varied. Potential impacts include: i) strengthening international relationships between museums, archives and academics in the UK, Sweden and The Netherlands. ii) developing archival and museology practices as they relate to gender and the ways in which collections are approached, curated, displayed and studied through sharing practices between a range of international scholars working in different academic disciplines (History, Literature and Art History), and curators, archivists and specialists working in the Heritage and Public History industries. In bringing academics and museum experts closer together through collaboration is mutually beneficial, and makes academics more aware of the possibilities museums offer, as well as the constraints they work under. iii) enhancing the visitor experience through new methods of display, and so developing cultural and social benefits for visitors. iv) engaging the general public in the UK and Sweden in an aspect of their cultural heritage through various public engagement activities (lectures and public talks), thus contributing to their knowledge, skills and quality of life. vi) enhancing schools' engagement with museum-based collections, via developing materials in the form of teaching packs repurposing research for use in the classroom, aligned with the National Curriculum. vii) providing expert knowledge contributing to public policy debates in Sweden (in association with Skarhults kulturminne, and its owner Baroness Alexandra von Schwerin) relating to curriculum change in the teaching of History within Swedish classrooms in order to enhance the study of women in the past. viii) understanding diversity of experiences contributes to a greater understanding of the world in which we live. Other beneficiaries such as curators, archivists, conservationists, museum educators, cataloguers and other museum professionals bringing specialist sector knowledge and practices will benefit from as well as contribute to transdisciplinary dialogue and educational practice.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS001603%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Various indicators show that looked-after children need better support from care and education providers. National Audit Office statistics from 2014 show that 20% of young homeless people, 24% of the adult prison population, and 70% of sex workers have been in care. In 2013, only 6% of care leavers were in Higher Education compared to 30% of that age demographic nationally. In 2015, 33% of looked-after children had been 'placed' more than once in a year in a children's home or with a foster family, and 10% had three placements or more. Such instability exacerbates looked-after children's well-documented vulnerability to mental health problems and jeopardises the stability needed for their educational and life success. In spite of the statutory requirement of the 1989 Children's Act to hear children's voices, an over emphasis on procedures and paperwork blocks effective communication and hinders the trusting relationships that children need to project a positive future.  THE VERBATIM FORMULA (TVF) will explore the potential of applied arts practice to provide vital interventions, providing life-changing support for young people, as well as opportunities for adults and institutions to make time, to listen, and to reflect on current practices. At a time when the care system is failing badly, and when universities are likely to have more responsibility for ensuring diverse participation following the White Paper for Higher Education (2016), TVF will give opportunities for adult professionals in both sectors to work together and to make changes that respond to young people's needs. Using Verbatim Theatre practices to support the articulation and confidence of young people's voices, the project positions children as creative evaluators of the services that are responsible for their care and wellbeing.  Based at QMUL and People's Palace Projects (PPP), a core operational team has been formed from QMUL's Departments of Drama, Business and Management, and Admissions and Widening Participation. Further collaborators include young adults from the Greater London Authority's Peer Outreach Team, and young adult care leavers from across London. Together, this team has facilitated a series of workshops that have supported 40 looked after children (14-18 years) in the South East and across the UK. Building on this experience, core activities in TVF will include a series of creative residential workshops facilitated in partnership with four universities in London to offer practical support to young people in articulating and planning their careers and education. In addition, a Young Researcher (YR) will develop a Portable Testimony Service (PTS) with the support and mentorship of Battersea Arts Centre (BAC). At QMUL, the PTS will be used to perform recorded, anonymised testimonies from looked-after children, care leavers, and adult care professionals, at an event to launch the university's new contextualised admissions policy. The PTS will share the audio testimonies further, providing a performative tool that creates space for dialogue and discussion around supporting looked-after children better. The YR and project's young partners will help to build an Alumni Network that will become a capable community of young people and adults who support each other in their journeys through care and beyond. Through a series of events to be held with BAC including a Festival of Creative Evaluative Practice, the project will support the development of and reflection on innovatory artistic and participatory practice as a means of evaluation and provision of services in loval governments and the third sector. A website and E-book for practitioners will disseminate the research, as well as a series of academic articles, papers, presentations and performances at major academic and professional conferences. Work with Parliament's Youth Select Committee will explore the utility of particpatory verbatim practice to wider policy contexts.","Young People and their Carers Young people in/leaving care themselves will be the primary beneficiaries of this research through the impact it will have on their confidence, visibility, self-awareness and improvements in their dialogue with adults. The project will benefit participants through participatory evaluation activities that will improve their ability to articulate their needs, desires and future plans clearly, as well as exposing them to educational and employment pathways according to their interests. Carers will benefit from the support the project will give them to help children plan for their futures, as well as from the opportunities it will provide to see and hear the children they care for in fresh and positive ways. Care and Education Service Providers Royal Society of Arts research emphasises the advantages to local authorities and other service providers in working with arts projects to tackle seemingly intransigent social challenges (RSA, 2013). TVF will support foster carers, social workers and corporate parents (eg. local authorities, residential home managers) by offering practical, informed support in planning for teenagers' futures, and also by supporting the statutory duty to listen to children's voices. In Higher Education (HE) the PTS will make an embodied impact on staff and their practices in Admissions, Finance, and Advice and Counselling, providing a cost efficient and highly effective way of raising and tackling the issues that affect the recruitment, retention and engagement of looked after young people. The jointly run workshops will also benefit University partners in reaching out to wider excluded cohorts. All universities will be able to benefit from an on-line Overnight Residency Guide for Widening Participation. Practitioners and Arts Organisations Practitioners and theatre companies will benefit from the project's findings on the potential for applied arts methods to be used to make an impact on participants' wellbeing, and on the use of participatory evaluation practice to provide training and reflection on professional practice in care and education contexts. Taking its lead from the AHRC's Cultural Value Project, the project will intervene in the hierarchy of evidence that privileges quantitative techniques in evaluative practice, putting child-centred creative approaches at the ideological and pedagogical centre. The proposed 'Scratch Tank' at BAC will enable practitioners to share applied arts projects and ideas widely with local authorities and other service providers. The project's website, the e-book for practitioners, and the proposed Festival and Manual of Creative Evaluative Practice will provide opportunities for knowledge exchange between practitioners and arts organisations, and for critical reflection on innovative applied projects and practices.  Third Sector, Government and Policy Having facilitated the GLA Care Week Conference for the last three years, and as a founding members of the Care Consortium which meets quarterly at City Hall to share good practice and advocate for change, INCHLEY and BAKER will continue to facilitate and contribute to meetings and events to which they are regularly invited, bringing performative modes of delivery and contributions from verbatim workshop participants. The 2017 Care Week Conference will be in partnership with the Fostering Network, and will incorporate verbatim material on children's experiences of their social work files, and of the treatment of child migrants. These activities disseminate research to professionals and policy makers performatively, making the profound impact that the Office of the Children's Commissioner has confirmed is needed to supplement written evidence. The team's embodied dissemination techniques will also be used to amplify the voices of young people with the Youth Select Committee in disseminating its upcoming Report on Race and Religious Hatred (2016).",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP010342%2F1

It will also explore the related question of how public audiences are able to 'feel' and 'think' about the concept of extinction, when they encounter objects of 'life and death' in the museum context. What do people think, imagine, and believe about the broad concept of 'extinction', and how are museums and galleries shaping such engagement? Its public facing exhibition will facilitate questions such as: Is mourning / lament an appropriate response to the phenomenon of extinction? Which visions of the future of 'humanity' or 'civilisation' (whether pessimistic or utopian) do we assume when we think about extinction? What other emotional, affective, moral responses are deemed appropriate? What beliefs about human death, life, mortality and immortality, are challenged? Is it acceptable to feel ambivalent in the face of extinction? What ongoing role (cultural, religious, fictional) might 'past' extinct life play in the social life of present and future generations (the power of living 'memory' for instance, or the belief in life's ongoing adaptation)?","The project relies heavily on co-creation and collaboration through workshops, artist commissioning, and public involvement. These activities will facilitate knowledge exchange and transfer during the developmental phase of the project. These activities include: 2-day critical, creative and participative interventions workshop at Manchester Museum (WP1) and artistic production. The PI will work closely with the APs on each of these activities in order to exchange and transfer knowledge and practices. The final exhibition which will create a forum for knowledge sharing with the general public. All three exhibitions will be advertised in the locality and region to promote visitors. To maximize knowledge exchange and transfer, we have developed a detailed communication deliverable plan by Work Package.

"Funding details                                                                                                              The vocabulary of Standard English includes approximately 600 words from Old Norse, the language of the Scandinavian newcomers who settled in Britain from the 9th to the 11th centuries (popularly known as 'the Vikings'). They tend to be everyday words (e.g. husband, skin, window; happy, ill, ugly; cast, die, scare), even personal pronouns (e.g. they), prepositions (e.g. until) and conjunctions (though). Many more terms are still used in the modern dialects of the areas where the Vikings originally settled (i.e. the so-called Danelaw; e.g. dale, fell, gowk; bain, gormless, mickle; attle, flit, laik). The Gersum Project has revolutionised the way in which we identify Norse loans in English by developing an innovative classification based on the reliability of the evidence for Norse derivation. A freely accessible online database classifying over 900 terms, a collection of essays and a series of journal articles will make our findings available to the academic community and other interested readers. We have also built a significant public engagement agenda, delivering 17 public talks, taking part in 4 radio interviews, etc. These activities have evidenced non-academic audiences' interest in the effects that the country's multicultural past has had on the English language, both at the local and national level.  With this follow-on project we aim to widen the public impact of our work by developing activities and resources that focus primarily on two sectors: education (primary and secondary school children and their teachers) and cultural heritage. We will: 1. Develop a series of online age-appropriate educational resources that will shape the way in which the lasting cultural impact of the Viking presence in England is taught in thousands of primary and secondary schools across the country. The resources will focus on present and past manifestations of Norse-derived words in English in general and the northern dialects in particular, with special emphasis on the North-West Midlands (the area where the texts included in the Gersum corpus originate). The resources will include written content, audio recordings by speakers from different dialectal areas, video recordings of lectures by the Gersum Team and other experts, interactive activities and downloadable resources that can be used in the classroom. Recent changes in the History A-level curriculum of the OCR examining board, where the prominence of this topic has significantly increased, underpin the timeliness of these resources.  2. Establish focus groups with teachers and examination board members, a teacher panel and training sessions in the use of the resources. Collaborating with the relevant stakeholders throughout the project and having the support of various educational organisations will enable us to create relevant and engaging resources that can be widely publicised and used. 3. Train York Archaeological Trust's (YAT; our project partner) front-of-house staff (particularly those working at the JORVIK Viking Centre) in topics concerning the Vikings and their presence in England, with particular focus on their linguistic impact. Need for training has arisen as a result of JORVIK's closure from 2015 to 2017 because of flood damage and subsequent staff changes. We will also provide YAT with a staff training manual for future use and linguistic information for their virtual learning environment.  4. Hold two family days at St Mary's Creative Space (Chester), in conjunction with Cheshire Record Office, and YAT's Barley Hall (York), respectively, as part of the nationwide Being Human festival, where visitors of all ages will be invited to explore the rich linguistic heritage of these dialectal areas through a series of activities aimed at different ages, including arts and crafts, storytelling and public lectures. The data and feedback that we gather during these days will further help the development of our educational resources.","Our project aims to generate significant cultural and financial impact in relation to the two sectors whose interests are at the core of our work (education and cultural heritage) and to the general public: 1. Education sector: our educational resources aimed at primary and secondary school pupils will support the teaching of courses about the English language (dialectal variation and diachronic change) and British history (Anglo-Scandinavian contacts during the early Middle Ages). They will provide teachers with materials that facilitate the delivery of well-informed and engaging lessons and will invite pupils to develop their knowledge further through self-study. The resources will aim to increase the pupils' interest in these subjects and hence their uptake in GCSE and A-Level courses, and, subsequently, at degree level, a particularly welcome outcome at a time when Arts and Humanities subjects are struggling to recruit students. Given the user numbers reported for the Pearson apps aimed at primary school pupils that the Gersum Team helped develop, and the fact that over 4,000 secondary schools in the country follow the OCR History and the AQA and Edexcel English Language A-Level courses, these resources will help shape the way in which these topics are taught across the country. Furthermore, by engaging teachers from over 30 schools in our focus groups, teacher panel and teacher training sessions, our work will contribute to the teachers' own professional development, a requirement for promotion. 2. Cultural heritage sector: our resources and two family days will draw attention to (and consequently, help increase the use of) the breadth of materials held by local and national institutions (primarily, the Cheshire Record Office and the British Library) for the study of past and current sociohistorical and linguistic topics which are of academic and public interest. The York Archaeological Trust (YAT), our project partners, will further benefit from our work in a number of ways: (i) by helping the Gersum Team to establish teacher focus groups, a panel and training sessions, they will strengthen and widen their existing links with local schools and, through them, the local community; (ii) the printable resources specifically linked to visits to the JORVIK Viking Centre, the linguistic information that will complement YAT's existing educational resources in their own virtual learning environment and the links to our educational resources, our training of between 10 and 20 of their front-line staff and production of a training manual for future use, and the family day to be held at YAT's Barley Hall, will all contribute to attract more visitors to their (physical and virtual) sites, thus boosting their income generation and, ultimately, facilitating the survival of this independent charity. 3. General public: the two family days, which will include hands-on activities, storytelling and public talks, will help redress views on linguistic 'correctness' and regionalism by highlighting the rich linguistic heritage of the northern dialects; this work will also have a positive impact on feelings of self-worth and the linguistic identity of the speakers of these dialects. Moreover, our training of YAT's staff will have a direct effect on visitor experience. With approximately 500,000 visitors per year, their sites are pivotal centres for the promotion of public understanding of the Scandinavian (and, more widely, sociohistorical) heritage of Yorkshire and Britain more generally.  In order to monitor the impact of our work, we will gather feedback from different sources: evaluation forms at the two family days; testimonials from teachers about the impact of our educational resources, and from YAT about our training and future uses of the training manual; and statistical information on the use of various parts of the Gersum website.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT005076%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project examines user engagement with an interactive, virtual exhibition that explores the role of photography in mediating the public understanding of the Holocaust. It builds on the success of the AHRC funded project 'Photography as Political Practice in National Socialism' (2018-21), which has explored the extent to which public understanding of the Holocaust is currently compromised by a one-sided reliance on perpetrator-made images. This follow-on funding allows us to ascertain whether a digital intervention can help audiences to view photographs of the Holocaust more critically. Our team and staff at the National Holocaust Centre and Museum (NHCM) have collaborated to create a virtual online version of our national touring exhibition 'The Eye as Witness: Recording the Holocaust', to pioneer methods for translating the project's insights into a digital forum, both extending the reach of our intervention and offering new modes for engaging learners with the importance of photographs in understanding histories of atrocity.  In addition to reproducing the core elements of the physical exhibition, the online version supplements them with specially designed virtual pedagogical spaces: an antechamber and a reflection room which users engage with at the beginning and end of the exhibition. These expand on the exhibition's content to engage the user more fully with the role of historical photographs, and to sharpen the pedagogical function in the absence a member of the NHCM's educational team. This project comprises working closely with various groups to assess the impact of the virtual exhibition: schools will provide the primary partners for testing the program, and we will also work closely with charities who engage with community groups. This will take place both in the UK and in collaboration with our international partners in the United States and Germany. Our project is ground-breaking in combining established qualitative methods of museum audience research (questionnaires and interviews) with innovations from digital humanities approaches, including gaze and movement tracking in the virtual exhibition, digitally recording choices visitors make about photographs on interactive screens, and inviting participants to respond textually to questions posed in the virtual exhibition. The resulting evidence will demonstrate the effects of our interventions on different demographics, empowering museums to make optimal use of our research for future developments in digital curatorial and educational strategy to engage target audiences effectively and ethically with photographic depictions of atrocity and victims of persecution. They will also support teachers and educators to improve the visual literacy of a new generation. This grant would enable us to: - Design visitor questionnaires and interview questions collaboratively with our museum and international partners, whilst drawing on existing scholarship and practice as outlined in 'Context' - Develop additional resources to support teachers in framing the classroom discussion around the virtual exhibition - Organise international trials of the virtual exhibition in the United Kingdom, United States and Germany, coordinating the user questionnaires, interviews and focus groups with teachers both online and in person - Analyse the outcomes of the above, in conjunction with the data gathered electronically from the virtual exhibition and the interactive activities, to arrive at a holistic assessment that addresses all questions outlined in the 'Objectives' - Share the outcomes with all participating partners in team meetings and use them to develop concrete recommendations for the future, including, but not confined to, the introduction of interactive and immersive technologies to museums where they have not yet been used - Work with museum educators and teachers to develop new approaches and pedagogies to enhance the use of digital tools in educational settings",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV012622%2F1

Current pain management programmes offer layered treatments, covering physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychology and medical procedures. Somatic practices have been used in treating pain in private sessions and occasionally in health care contexts (hospital/GP surgery), but are not widespread in being acknowledged as a source of support for those experiencing chronic pain. Somatic practices offer body-mind reflective tools that support taking ownership of one's own bodily experience and finding ways of living with complex conditions. The network seeks to stimulate a dialogue between arts based (dance, media, design) and science based (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, nursing) experts who are both practitioners and academics to explore innovative and transdisciplinary methods for understanding multi-dimensional pain experience in relation to sense-perception and environmental factors. Current pain assessment is often of value in measuring a range of objective outcomes such as increased mobility but is limited in assessing, exploring and understanding the shifting lived experience of those suffering from pain. The lens of assessment also rarely incorporates the layers of knowledge gathered by practitioners (e.g., physiotherapists) or carers (e.g., parents, spouse) through their extended periods of contact with the person experiencing pain. Further, the language of self-care in somatics or self-management in health can have different affects and motivations ranging from more person-centred to more societal ones; for example returning 'expertise' to those with chronic pain, or moving financial and social responsibility from the state to the individual in neo-liberal economies.  Notwithstanding the issues of self management, the representation of lived experience through digital tools can offer methods for recording and analysing disparate layers of experience - visualising personal narratives of pain, sharing health care and somatic perspectives on pain and gathering an array of techniques for living with chronic pain. Somatic practices offer methods for observing and communicating subjective experiences of pain through moving, speaking, writing, and drawing which can be captured using audio-visual means, offering ways of articulating experiences arising from sensation, emotion, thoughts, images, narrative, and so on. Attention to somatic experience also brings with it an awareness of the body in context, revealing the embodiment of social, cultural, economic and political factors. In relation to pain, a sample of these factors include access to care related to gender, race, education and social status; stigmatisation surrounding 'invisible' chronic health problems; and differing beliefs surrounding pain by patients, family members, and healthcare professionals. Somatic approaches offer a means for those experiencing and treating pain to understand better how contextual factors manifest in bodily experience (e.g. what is the somatic experience of not being able to articulate pain or not feeling believed about pain experiences) and to see how socio-cultural issues impact on pain perception, experience and expression.","The research is of benefit to stakeholders and professionals in the following ways: Independent somatic movement practitioners  - Develop their practice /skills in chronic pain field - Provide opportunities for their work to be valued and applied in hospitals/pain management programmes - Reflect on pain management in the career of the dance artist   Healthcare workers including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and nurses working with chronic pain - Develop new knowledge and skills in somatic approaches to movement - Open up understanding of arts-based and co-creative methods - Test new creative tools for understanding chronic pain People living with chronic pain - Opportunity to include their voice in methods for understanding their experiences - Learn somatic skills for self care and articulating experiences  - Reflect on digital tools for living with symptoms and mapping changing experiences Pain management and support organisations such as British Pain Society, The Walton Centre Pain Research Institute, etc. - New tools and methods for understanding chronic pain and its effects on patients' lives - Understand innovative new approaches to working with those with chronic pain and stay in touch with developments in the field of research E-health professionals and organisations - Test innovation skills and ideas in exploring how dance and somatic movement can be captured  - Explore how new concepts for digital tools can be used to innovate in healthcare settings - Reflect on how digital tools can be used for mapping experiences, shifting the focus away from measuring 'outcomes'",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS003495%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              In recent years, the Internet and social media have played a prominent role in a range of social and political protests across the globe - from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street to the Spanish Indignados, it is clear that new media technologies have the potential to create social change, reforming political systems, and challenging a range of oppressive ideologies. Yet such technologies have also opened up highly visible public spaces for the proliferation of online forms of sexism, harassment, and misogyny (hatred of women and girls). There have been numerous high profile stories about 'e-bile' (online hatred) and 'trolling' (online stalking) of women, and a growing concern over the normalisation and acceptance of rape jokes and images that celebrate violence against girls and women on web 2.0 platforms like Twitter and Facebook. While the UK government has recognised 'media sexism' as a growing problem, and has run a number of awareness campaigns aimed at rape prevention and stopping sexual violence and abuse, there is little research which documents the particular forms that misogyny takes in a digitally mediated culture, and even less which analyses the range of activist responses to this problem which mobilize new media technologies in innovative and creative ways.  Although it is only beginning to attract mainstream media attention, feminists are fighting back against the proliferation of rape culture through their uses of new media platforms and technologies. For example, an international group of feminist activists recently initiated the #FBrape campaign which solicited over 60,000 tweets and 5,000 emails to Facebook's corporate advertisers, demanding that companies pull their advertisements from the social media company due to Facebook's refusal to remove misogynist content encouraging violence against women and girls. The one-week campaign resulted in a promise from Facebook to change their policies on hate speech and make it easier to remove pages which promote rape culture, misogyny and sexual violence towards women and girls. Similarly, a number of websites, Facebook pages and Twitter hashtags have been created which encourage women and girls to document, photograph, and record instances of misogyny and harassment, raising public awareness and creating communities to support victims. Consequently, the main objectives of this research are to 1) map out how and when rape culture, harassment, misogyny and sexual violence are occurring in on and off-line spaces; 2) explore and analyse feminist responses to these incidents; 3) understand the experiences of women and girls who participate in this activism; and 4) to document feminist responses and experiences through the creation of a living archive of contemporary digital feminist activism.  To meet these aims the project uses interdisciplinary research methods including content and feminist critical discourse analysis of online media, and ethnographic methods, such as observation of online activist communities and interviews with feminist activists, to explore how and why they are using digital technology. The research has the potential to benefit a number of stakeholders including feminist activists, government, charitable organisations, and media companies like Facebook by documenting some of the forms that new media misogyny is taking and a range of feminist digital activist responses. Our primary digital output is an online archive that will document this feminist activism and facilitate a collaborative space where activists can record their own initiatives and connect with other women and girls globally.","The project's findings and assessment of its significance will be disseminated through a series of outputs for academics (two books, one of which is an edited collection) and the public (an online archive documenting feminist activism and experiences).  In order to engage with key potential users of our research findings and our digital archive we will hold an interim data sharing workshop at the IOE, to which we will invite activists, policy makers, industry members and charitable organisations to offer feedback on our emerging findings, and to help shape the digital archive. We will also host a one-day symposium 'Online Feminist Activism' at the Feminist Library, which will further disseminate our results amongst academics, feminists, charities, policy makers, students, and other community members.  The research will: 1. Document, collect and publicise various forms of feminist activism which challenge sexism, misogyny and rape culture. 2. Involve feminist activists, policy makers, industry leaders, and charitable organisations in the research, particularly at the stages of data analysis and dissemination.   Who Will Benefit: 1. Academics will obtain a greater understanding of the ways misogyny and rape culture circulate in on and offline spaces, and how activists are responding to this culture. 2. Feminists will gain greater knowledge and awareness of a range of activism taking place. This can help in brainstorming, networking, consciousness raising, and action. 3. Individuals who do not currently identify as feminists can use the project to learn more about various issues and potentially become involved. 4. Our project partners will benefit from increased visits to their websites. 5. The Feminist Library which is hosting our one-day symposium will increase visitor numbers. 6. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter will have documentation of sexism, harassment and misogyny being distributed through their platforms. This information can help them to respond and improve their policies around such content. 7. Policy makers such as the Home Office, Department of Culture, Media and Sport, and SCOOP, who are interested in issues related to ending violence against women and girls yet lack academically rigorous research findings on the nature of online misogyny as well as a systematic picture of the numerous strategies underway to combat this. 8. Charitable organisations like EVAW will have access to the academic research findings to support their media campaigns and government lobbying to protest violence against women and girls, rape culture and 'media sexism'.  How They Will Benefit:  1.By challenging hatred and violence against girls and women happening in new media spaces the project aims for enhanced quality of life of citizens (particularly feminists) but also the wider public and various stakeholders, who will gain a greater awareness of sexisms effects on society. They will also have a greater understanding of how online channels can be used to challenge this sexism, thereby directly contributing to the ideals of connected communities both nationally and internationally. 2. By providing a space to document digital feminist activism and providing a hub for some of the diverse activism that is taking place, the project is contributing to the construction of a more connected feminist community where academics work with, share and develop understandings with activists and other stakeholders who may not be directly in touch with academic communities otherwise. 3. Enhanced public knowledge about feminism to counter the notion that feminism is irrelevant or that young women are politically disengaged. 4. Enhanced public participation and engagement as the academic and feminist community become more aware of various campaigns. 5. Providing knowledge to inform new areas of research and fill a current gap in the academic literature. This will benefit academics, stakeholders and policy makers.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL009587%2F1

In its investigation of the evolution of museum collections, the 'Universal Histories and Universal Museums' project strongly connects with the third objective of both the 'The Past in the Present' and the 'Care for the Future' programmes: the mediation, and the cultural and social appropriation of the past, from transnational perspectives.  Looking at the history of museum collections is one of the ways in which we can examine how history is made, displayed and disseminated through the uses, legacies and representations of the past. Our research will highlight the constituent features of encyclopaedic knowledge about western universal human histories, from the nineteenth century to the present day. It will also examine the assumptions and limitations of such understanding. In particular, the project seeks to address questions regarding the representation of the diversity of cultures that define human universality, the articulation of historical and anthropological approaches to the description of humanity and the influence of social knowledge practices on the structuring of universal knowledge. The project also considers ways thinking about the past help us to prepare for a global future that incorporates more diverse universalities. The first phase of the project will combine critical investigation through four workshops and two historical case studies, based in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Musée du quai Branly. The project's second phase will consolidate the first phase research in a small exhibition based on the two case studies, and a conference timed to align with the opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi - a contemporary universal museum. Publications will include a book, articles in peer-reviewed journals and digitisation of key archival resources.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN504567%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Widely recognised as one of the most ecologically significant areas of the world, the Amazon region is under threat by interconnected crises: climate change, extractive industry and pollution, poverty, malnutrition. Crisis in the Amazon spells crisis for the rest of the world: playing a pivotal role in the regulation of global climate patterns, maintaining the Amazon rainforest's ecological dynamics is a crucial aspect of halting runaway global heating. Central to this is the safeguarding of rainforest biodiversity, to ensure ecological resilience to climate shocks. Having actively maintained and enhanced Amazonian biodiversity over millennia before the Spanish Conquest of South America, indigenous communities excel as stewards of biodiversity, yet they are still marginalised and discriminated against. Most approaches aiming to overcome this marginalisation and discrimination are aimed at improved inclusion into the national political, economic, education and health systems. While intentions may be laudable, many of these approaches are not indigenous-led, and may have consequences of eroding indigenous lifeways, ancestral practices, and the very worldviews which have supported indigenous relationships with the forest and its more-than-human inhabitants. Conducting collaborative research with indigenous organisations to support their self-organised strategies of resilience and cultural resistance, is not only a matter of social justice, but constitutes an active safeguarding of the Amazon's bio-cultural diversity in a time when the world needs them most.  At the heart of many indigenous Amazonian societies lies the chakra - the traditional forest garden, or more specifically a complex network of cultivated forest spaces. Recently, the chakra has been heralded as a solution to the dilemma between environmental and economic sustainability and initiatives are underway to promote the chakra as emblematic of sustainable production methods. This new market orientation, however, overlooks the spiritual and cultural centrality of the chakra to indigenous lifeways: as the basis for good health, a space where social bonds and community relations are created and maintained and where much intergenerational transmission of knowledge unfolds, including through songs and a very literal 'speaking with plants'. The chakra, as central constituent of many Amazonian lifeways, as sphere of interaction between human and forest beings, space of entanglement of 'culture' and 'nature', is an ideal entry point into exploring indigenous cultural resilience to and overcoming of crises through a revitalisation of ancestral knowledges and practices.  Arising from ongoing dialogue with indigenous organisations over several years, this project brings together a partnership of academic and indigenous researchers to understand and harness the potential of the chakra for indigenous communities' responses to the challenges posed by interconnected crises in the Amazon region. Concomitantly, the project seeks to strengthen indigenous communities' capacity for self-advocacy, to document, analyse and communicate in their own voices the issues affecting their lives and potential solutions thereto. Working together with three Napo Runa communities (Kichwa of the Upper Napo River) in Ecuador, and three Urarina communities of the Chambira Basin in Peru, the project uses participatory video and other methodologies which overcome literacy barriers and centre indigenous communities as key knowledge producers in the research process. Knowledge exchange events will foster cross-cultural connections. Led by a steering committee consisting of academic investigators and indigenous organisations, the project will produce video libraries, documentaries, scientific articles, a methodological toolkit and a policy brief to bring indigenous Amazonian research on cultural resilience to multiple audiences.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX008290%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This Follow-on Funding (FoF) application seeks to develop for dissemination the models, methods, tools and approaches piloted and iterated within the AHRC-funded 'Design Thinking for Prison Industries' project, led by Professors Gamman and Thorpe at the Design Against Crime Research Centre (DACRC), University of the Arts London, in collaboration with Praveen Nahar, at the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. The aim of the project is to extend the positive impact of the 'Design Thinking for Prison Industries' (DTPI) programme by 'scaling out' the delivery model to prison staff and those delivering criminal justice education programmes from public, private and third sector organisations in the UK. We will do this by developing the educational resources for digital dissemination and further refining the delivery, volunteering and enterprise models created and tested within the pilot project. Fulfillment of this aim requires the development and dissemination of three elements of the DTPI programme: A. Models i. The unique DTPI model for design education developed within a prison industries setting, communicating the 'theory of change' linked to 'design thinking and making' as restorative/transformative enterprise. This approach can help inmates understand different ways of being self-employed and the entrepreneurial opportunities available to them. ii. The model for equipping postgraduate prison volunteers with the necessary skills to provide mentoring and one-to-one facilitation of inmate learners, within a design-led DTPI programme, is unique. This model also offers a proven and pragmatic way of delivering the 'graduates into prison agenda' recommended by the Coates Review (2016), commissioned by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to improve effective education in prison. iii. The social enterprise model developed within the existing DTPI programme offers a new way for prison industries to meet the additional costs of programmes such as 'Makeright', a DTPI sub-project which enables inmates to co-design and produce commercial anti-theft bags (www.makeright.org) to support sustainability in a climate of economic austerity. B. Resources The FoF project will further develop and share the Makeright learning and teaching resources that deliver design thinking education that aims to build inmate empathy, resilience and entrepreneurship, as well as teaching for anti-theft bag design within UK prison textiles studios. The existing resources have been iteratively developed via the AHRC/British Council (Unbox) and Serco-funded pilot at HMP Thameside, London, and Sabarmati Jail, Ahmedabad. Whilst our evaluation of them shows that they are effective, we now need to re-design them in a form that is appropriate and accessible for use by other qualified delivery agencies in prison industry settings. The objective is to work with these agencies in the development and testing of the resources before finalisation.  C. Continuous Professional Development (CPD) and DTPI Training Module The project will also develop and test a 'train the trainer' programme for those in prison, design education and third sector agencies wanting to deliver similar projects based on our resources connected to local prison industry settings. Inmates who have worked on Makeright, when interviewed, tell us that they recognise that self-employment may be the most viable route to employment for them once they leave prison, in part because of stigma attached to being an ex-offender. Consequently, the Makeright knowledge exchange model and strategy has the capacity to build resilience and so is incredibly useful to prisons struggling to find employment for inmates.","The press interest in the project to date is a strong indicator of its potential for impact; our ambition is to bring four constituencies into dialogue, including: - The crime and justice community, which is interested in what works in prison and how it might lead to 'desistance' (Maruna 2001; Laub & Sampson 2001); in particular those who are looking to build inmate resilience for the world of work.  - The academic design research community, which is interested in how social design education and action research can be applied, linked to innovative methodologies and cross-disciplinary approaches to help democratise innovation and transform lives. - The business and entrepreneurial communities, which can contribute to enterprise strategies and learn how projects such as this enhance public services in sustainable ways, which may lead to improve service delivery, economic benefits and employment opportunities for inmates. - Social innovators, such as Forum for the Future, which are interested in how to manage change and change leadership, and to help communities build resilience.   The DTPI/Makeright project has already received press attention internationally, but our new focus on dissemination intends to join up diverse communities in prison that do not usually connect in order to deliver impact by explaining how the process of the project is significant, more significant than the anti-theft bags generated. It will do this by:  - providing more inmates in the national context with educational process resources aimed at finding new ways to catalyse change and reduce repeat offending, through design education, in particular design thinking skills - publishing account/s of how inmates' personal, social, artistic and professional skills including building empathy, trust and teamwork that impact on their lives and their engagement with wider society can be understood and addressed by prison industries and prison education - introducing inmates to new opportunities linked to self-employment narratives that will be further researched - helping to build empathy for crime victims and understanding of RJ processes. There is significant evidence that design processes, methods and tools generate empathy for users when they design objects for others; the team intends to develop these links and create systemic follow-on programme/course opportunities for inmates interested in RJ.   The creative outputs generated by the project (not just anti-theft bags designed by inmates but system design and process methods about design creativity synthesised by the research team and built into the Makeright educational materials created) are likely to be further exhibited by museum education and learning teams who already engage with criminal justice exhibitions, including the Koestler Foundation, ClinkArts and NCJAA. It is also likely that the creativity of the inmates and the objects they produce in numerous prisons linked to Makeright programmes will lead to further opportunities for exhibition in diverse spaces including the Design Museum and possibly the Tate, and thus directly address every level of education. Formal learning groups such as secondary school programmes in design and technology will benefit from new forms of design analysis that this project offers, linked to accounts of the design process, as well as to the impact of 3D visualisations of anti-theft bags. Museum visitors may be another audience segment who will gain from learning about how creativity can transform lives, in addition to prison staff who will see from the project outputs how design thinking can make a difference and produce functional and beautiful commercial objects as well as change behaviour and mindsets. Beyond these likely impacts and gains, there are more speculative ones relating to how social cohesiveness can by supported by (and can support in turn) a wider state of community safety and perception of fair and satisfying justice.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR00157X%2F1

The project proposes a new paradigm in accessible experiences, in which there is not an overreliance on a narrator's spoken word, as in traditional Audio Description practices. Instead it utilises new accessibility features that include: the addition of sound effects, the spatialisation of dialogue and sounding objects, and first-person narration, to provide accessible experiences that are seamlessly integrated to the soundtrack of a film or television programme. These techniques would be integrated into film and television workflows from the development phase up to final delivery. The project builds up from previous research which demonstrated the success of these methods, and explores them even further, by concentrating on the conveyance of cinematographic elements (such as types of shot, composition and camera angles) through sound, the exploration of the intricacies of using first-person narration across different genres and different cast sizes, as well as exploring how spatialisation techniques can be adapted for multi-listener scenarios for a variety of loudspeaker formats. The exploration of these methods will be conducted with an end-user centred approach, in which visually impaired audiences are consulted from the design process up to delivery. Furthermore, the project explores the creation of guidelines that will allow the incorporation of these methods to professional broadcasting pipelines and film workflows, by collaborating with a Project Advisory Panel representative of the different roles in film and television as well as end users. These guidelines will be explored through two newly broadcast episodes of television drama, one short documentary film and a feature film. Enhancing Audio Description II explores how new creative forms of accessibility can be made available through different reproduction formats (headphones/loudspeakers) alongside traditional access forms, allowing end users to choose the format that works best for them. This would result in personalised experiences that acknowledge the diversity in needs and preferences of visually impaired audiences. Enhancing Audio Description II fuses audio technology and creativity to widen the notion of media accessibility and increase the quality and quantity of provision, providing cutting edge techniques to the UK cultural sector.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV015583%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              How do we compare the experiences of going to the cinema in the 1950s in the United Kingdom, Sweden or Greece? Which genres of films and stars were loved in different European cities? What influenced audiences' views or choices? European Cinema Audiences is the first comparative project that focuses on cinema audiences across Europe. It aims to collect and analyse memories of their experiences, which are contextualized by unique local archival material on cinema-going, in order to gain a better understanding of the shared memories and the entangled histories of cinema-going in seven mid-sized European cities. Focusing on Bari (IT), Brno (CZ), Ghent (BE), Gothenburg (SE), Leicester (UK), Rotterdam (NL), and Thessaloniki (EL), the project will investigate differences and similarities in the way cinema-going was practiced, experienced, and remembered across Europe. Our respondents are, in fact, the last surviving generation for which going to the cinema was the only way to experience movies and collecting their memories before they are lost will provide a vital contribution to the understanding of the transnational and comparative history of European cinema culture.  The project will be led by three academic experts in the history of cinema audiences - Daniela Treveri Gennari (Oxford Brookes University), Lies Van de Vijver (Ghent University) and Pierluigi Ercole (De Montfort University) - who will be working in partnership with heritage and educational organizations across Europe.  The absence of any empirically-based research on the experience of film audiences across Europe leave unanswered crucial questions about the most popular leisure time activity for Europeans in the 1950s. The European Cinema Audiences project will bridge this gap by working in partnership with local archives and communities to create initially a digital repository of historical material related to the cinemas of the chosen cities. The material collected will be used to both trigger memories of cinema-going experiences and obtain a greater understanding of the cinema culture across Europe. Filmed interviews with audience members reminiscing about their experience of cinema-going will be conducted. The oral histories collected will be analysed using NVivo software and following a protocol (previously tested in a pilot project) which will address the challenges of such a multilingual project, both in terms of cultural and language differences. The video-interviews will be read against data related to film exhibition, reception and programming, in order to open up new perspectives on the relationship between the institutional context of film consumption and the remembered experiences of cinema-going across Europe.  The project's results will be validated through a variety of academic (conference papers, a monograph, a special issue in an academic journal and a peer-reviewed article) and non-academic (public engagement events and digital archive) outputs. At the core of the European Cinema Audiences project is the interaction with community groups and local associations. Thus, in each city a researcher will coordinate the activities with the general public, who will learn to interact with the digital archive and share the significance of their memories with other generations of cinema-goers. Archivists and researchers, as well as local communities will work together in order to take ownership of the cultural and historical materials collected through a series of impact activities. The project's collaboration with Google Arts and Culture will enable researchers and communities to become curators of special virtual exhibitions based on the material collected, while the aggregation of the data with the Europeana collection will allow further dissemination of the project.","European Cinema Audiences aims to engage with: 1) academic community and educators; 2) cultural stakeholders; 3) general public, especially those interested in cinema, cultural and digital heritage. 1) The project will engage with academics in the fields of Film Studies, European Audience Studies, Oral History, Cultural Memory, Digital Humanities, Cultural Heritage, History, as well as more broadly Digital Heritage and Leisure Studies, but also Ageing Studies. (See Academic Beneficiaries for details). Educators will have the opportunity to use the digital archive as pedagogic material. This has been tested in the Italian Cinema Audiences project, where schools worked successfully with the project's material.  2) The project will enable our cultural stakeholders (the archives involved: Mediateca regionale pugliese, Archive of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, Brno City Archive, Media Archive for Central England, Regional State Archives in Gothenburg, City Archive Rotterdam, City Archive of Ghent) to achieve greater visibility and expand the outreach of their collections. The broad scope of the data that European Cinema Audiences will bring together and make available for reuse will allow archives to reach a wider public, ensuring networking and engagement with organizations and people both at local, national and European levels. The project's digital archive will offer stakeholders and cultural institutions - as well as scholars and the general public - the opportunity to engage in the interpretation of the entangled histories of cinema audiences across Europe. In a transnational collaboration among cultural organisations in different European cities, the project will open up opportunities for archivists, and cultural specialists to make use of the project's results, both at global and at local level. At a global level, the project will increase the outreach of the collection through: a) Memoro, that will collect the oral histories and disseminate our project on their website which has over 3 million visitors worldwide. b) Google Arts & Culture, which works with over 900 cultural institutions across the word and have so far reached 240 million page views, will collaborate with researchers and communities in creating virtual collections for each case study and special exhibitions from the digital archive's material; c) Europeana, which weaves together over 3000 cultural heritage institutions, and whose website had only in 2016 over 4 million views worldwide, will make our material available to their users.  3) European Cinema Audiences involves the memories of audiences of the postwar period, which has produced significant impact on non-academic communities in national projects of a similar nature. At a local level, the general public will be involved in a series of events in the seven cities selected. The first series of events (launch of the digital archive) - organized in collaboration with the local archives - will promote public access to the project's digital archive and invite elderly interested in sharing their own memories of cinema-going. The second series of public engagement events will be organised so that community group members will learn to interact with the digital archive and add their memories to it. Such events will replicate the model tested in the Sharing Memories events organised in Italian Cinema Audiences and proven to be extremely successful. In some cases, these events will be organized in collaboration with film festivals who have local impact, but international visibility: the Film Fest Ghent, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, and the International Film Festival Rotterdam. The closing event of the project will take place in the Winter Circus in Ghent. This event will bring together academic researchers, cultural stakeholders, but also aging experts, and the general public.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR006326%2F1

The BBC has agreed to air the programme on BBC4 during October 2021 as part of its celebration of National Poetry Month. The BBC are a partner on the project, contributing cash and in-kind costs (although they are unable, for legal and business reasons, to state the value of air-time and other costs associated with transmissions). The programme will contain extracts from the long poem written as the practice-as-research output for the original Red River AHRC project. In the 1880s, the river was described as one of the most lucrative in the world because of the mineral wealth generated from the mine sediments carried in its water. After the collapse of mining in Cornwall in the 1990s, the mining district of Pool, Redruth and Camborne, through which the Red River flows, became one of the poorest in Europe. The impact of this shift has been dramatic and traumatic. Now, with investment flowing back into Cornwall to fund the 'ethical' extraction of rare-earth metals like lithium and cobalt, and 'enabling metals' like tin, the area is again being described as the UK's mineral 'Klondike'. This is the right moment to think about the river's past, present and future as a complex human/nature hybrid subject shaped by extractive industries, and to use the poem (and associated research) composed for the Red River project to inform a BBC4 TV documentary about the river that will foreground the issues it raises at a national level.  The film will cross BBC TV's arts and nature programme genres. It will take an innovative filming approach to the small-scale, damaged and sometimes 'ugly' appearance of the river and celebrate its complexity as a neglected human/natural hybrid landform rich in culture significance, and damaged and recovering biodiversity. The film will explore questions about the future of the river and, by extension, other mistreated minor watercourses. Interviewees will be drawn from the pool of individuals who have contributed to and shaped the research project, and will include local voices as well as academics and experts. Interviews will be conducted on location at sites along the Red River to ensure the programme is local in its engagement with the detail, but of national and even global significance in terms of landscape debates around remediation and local community engagement.  We will hold live regional screenings and panel discussions with our regional partners to ensure that the film reaches local audiences who do not usually access BBC4 TV, and to debate and record impact responses to the issues it raises. These events may take place at the Eden Project, Heartlands, The Cornubian Arts and Science Trust and the Environment Sustainability Centre at the Penryn Campus of Exeter University. These events form part of the existing programme of impact and engagement activities planned for the second half of 2021 as part of the Red River project. The PI will present and co-write the script with the independent ex-BBC producer Simon Willis. The scripting, organising, interviews and filming will take place over a period of approximately two months from the start date of the award. The film will greatly enhance, through creative and innovative filming, the impact of the original AHRC-funded Red River project.

This proposal will scoping research to support a Strategic Priorities Fund application on: Arts, culture and health (to include arts-based social prescribing). Such scoping research is required to critically assess: - Strengths and weaknesses of the current evidence base, with a focus on identifying gaps in the evidence base; - Synergies and areas of uniqueness between 'arts and health' and 'social prescribing' research; - Perceptions from key academics, practitioners and practice-based researchers on research priorities in the fields of arts and health and social prescribing (*see consultee list below); - Exploration of feasible translation mechanisms for disbursing a large strategic grant including; - A SWOT analysis of a large grant scheme being administered and disbursed via the proposed National Strategic Centre for Arts, Health and Wellbeing, as compared to a UKRI-led model.","This proposal will conduct scoping research which will feed into the development of a draft Strategic Priorities Fund (SPF) bid.

"Funding details                                                                                                              Successful companies are essential for a strong economy. However poorly run companies can cause serious economic and social harm as the financial crisis and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill demonstrate. Directors of large companies exercise great power as their decisions can have significant ramifications for their companies and for society. Adequate accountability is often seen as necessary to legitimise power, deter careless and self interested behaviour and encourage better conduct. Yet directors of large public companies enjoy a high degree of immunity from legal liability for decisions that cause harm. A key reason is that courts have stated that the exercise of business judgment by directors should be immune from judicial review. Yet although classifying a decision as a business judgment provides directors with a powerful shield from accountability, exactly what is meant by a business judgment, and what decisions count as such, has not been closely considered. This is a significant gap in knowledge that makes it difficult to assess whether there are good policy reasons for directors' lack of legal accountability: this cannot be assessed without knowing what kinds of decision are exempted from review, what are reviewed, and why, the potential impact on directors of review, and in the light of these considerations, whether arguments for and against review justify the judicial position generally and in individual cases.  There are important social, legal and practical reasons for exploring these issues. The difficulty of challenging directors' decisions has led to an absence of legal accountability for directors, as the prospect of successful litigation against them in respect of their decisions is very low, and in public companies practically non-existent. The resulting lack of legal action against, for example, former bank directors for conduct castigated as reckless, caused widespread public dismay. Furthermore, insofar as the courts are now required by statute to assess commercial decisions (for example under section 263(2)(a) and(3)(b) Companies Act 2006), a failure to do so may undermine statutory goals. At the same time holding directors liable for their decisions may have adverse economic consequences: greater judicial scrutiny could cause directors to make conservative decisions, deter entrepreneurial risk taking and deter able people from being directors. Because there is no clarity about what constitutes a business judgment, when the courts do pass judgment (positively or negatively) on directors' decisions they may be assessing business judgments, but not recognising this. The ramifications of this, and of increased judicial scrutiny of directors' decisions, for boards, shareholders, stakeholders and corporate governance, is little understood.  This inter-disciplinary project which brings together a team of researchers from the School of Law, Leeds and the School of Management, Liverpool, aims to address this gap and allow for an informed assessment of whether the status quo should be maintained or, if changes are necessary, provide a framework within which to identify what changes are desirable. The project is of international significance: what constitutes a business judgment and when directors' decisions should be reviewed are difficult issues across jurisdictions, and are dealt with very differently. In the US the rule of law termed 'the business judgment rule' has rendered directors' decisions immune from judicial scrutiny in most cases. In contrast in Australia decisions taken by directors of public companies have been subject to judicial review following successful regulatory action. Both approaches have been subject to criticism. The study will contribute to and augment this international debate over the appropriateness of courts and regulators reviewing directors' decisions and the broader implications for corporate governance, entrepreneurial risk-taking and director accountability.","1. Policy-Makers/Government Successful companies are essential for a strong economy but when companies are poorly run, particularly large companies, this can have adverse economic and social consequences. How to regulate large companies to ensure that they are well run, and whether directors are sufficiently accountable to shareholders and other stakeholders are therefore key policy issues. Policy-makers have recognised this, setting out a need for greater director accountability to maintain and restore market trust in order to increase economic activity and investment (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) papers 'Transparency and Trust' (2013 and 2014)). By examining the extent to which courts intervene in directors' decision-making, and the potential impact of greater or lesser intervention, the project will assist legislators and policy-makers such as BIS, in designing measures that may impact on directors' legal accountability for their decisions.  2. Regulators The project will be relevant to regulators in the UK and other jurisdictions, such as the Financial Conduct Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that must determine when to take action in relation to directors' decisions that have adverse outcomes. This issue is likely to arise under the new liability regime for senior managers in financial institutions which will be implemented March 2016: the FCA's predecessor received much criticism when it decided that it could not challenge directors' business judgment even when, as in the case of RBS, this led to disaster. The empirical data will contribute towards evidence based policy-making particularly in relation to enforcement policies and policies designed to promote directorial accountability. By assisting better informed regulation of companies it will contribute toward wealth creation and economic prosperity.  3. The Courts By facilitating a better understanding of when exactly the courts are holding directors to account it will be possible to assess whether directors and those bringing actions against them, such as shareholders, are being treated in a fair, consistent and principled manner. If this is not the case one would expect judicial practice to respond, to the benefit of directors and shareholders.  4. Professional and Practitioner Groups The project has the potential to inform the practice of solicitors and barristers who act for companies, shareholders and directors, giving them reasoned bases for arguing in court for or against holding directors liable for particular categories of decisions. This in turn may impact on judicial practice and alter the law so that it develops on a more coherent basis and avoids inappropriate judicial scrutiny of directors' decisions whilst encouraging appropriate scrutiny and accountability.  5. Directors The project is supported by the Institute of Directors. The focus groups will be offered as continuing professional development and, by providing a forum within which directors can interact with others regarding when courts will review decisions and what, if anything, they consider to be problematic about the decisions that form the basis of the case studies, will enable them to re-evaluate their own understandings and experiences.  6. Companies and Shareholders It will assist shareholders in assessing when challenges to directors' judgments may be mounted thus facilitating board accountability to shareholders. This in turn may indirectly benefit the wider public by promoting wealth creation and prosperity by discouraging reckless decision-making such as that seen during the financial crisis. Companies will also benefit from ascertaining when reviewing decisions could be harmful.  7. The Public The project will enable more informed public debate about whether it is appropriate to hold directors accountable for business decisions with poor outcomes, a matter of on-going public concern.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN008863%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Hoards of valued materials, particularly coins, are a common, and rapidly growing, class of discovery across the Roman Empire. While these are most commonly seen as having been deposited for safe keeping, other explanations for this activity are also possible. There has been little explicit discussion or research on why Roman coin hoards were buried, why hoards were not recovered in antiquity, or what they tell us when studied as a group. Six hundred hoards are known from Britain containing coins of the period AD 253-96, an unprecedented concentration, and they provide a key and under-used dataset that can shed light on a poorly known period of British archaeology and history.  The British pattern of later 3rd-century hoards differs markedly from the rest of the western Roman empire, despite the political problems that affected Britain at this time being felt equally or more severely in many other European provinces. This anomaly merits detailed investigation and the results will have implications not only for interpretation of this specific hoarding phenomenon, but will contribute significantly to more general debates about hoarding behaviour in antiquity. Traditionally these hoards have been interpreted as having been buried with the intention of recovery but recent discoveries such as the Frome hoard have suggested the possibility that these hoards may have been ritual (or `votive') deposits. Ritual deposition is a common explanation for prehistoric metalwork, and many, if not all, Iron Age coin hoards. Can we show whether any of the 3rd century hoards were likely to have been ritual deposits and, if so, how many? If so, what are the implications for the use of their contents in studying monetary history or political history? We propose to ask the following research questions:  1. Why were coin hoards deposited in Roman Britain - and was this for similar reasons as other Iron Age and Roman coin hoards?  2. Why were so many coin hoards deposited (and not recovered) in 3rd-century Britain and is their date of burial the same as the date of their latest coins? 3. What do coin hoards tell us about the economic and political history of 3rd-century Britain? 4. How different or similar are 3rd-century British coin hoards to those from other periods of Roman Britain or other parts of northwestern provinces of the Roman Empire?  5. What wider lessons can be learnt about using coin hoards to understand the economic, political and religious history of the Roman Empire? The project brings together the expertise of the British Museum in the study of Roman coins and hoards and the academic strengths of the University of Leicester in Roman archaeology and their experience of investigating coin hoards in a landscape setting. The PI, Dr Roger Bland, is Keeper of Portable Antiquities & Treasure at the British Museum and has very extensive experience studying hoards; the CIs are Professors Colin Haselgrove and David Mattingly, leading experts respectively on Iron Age archaeology and coinage and on the archaeology and economy of the Roman Empire. Under their collective guidance and with input from expert colleagues, 3 RAs will study (1) the hoards from Britain and the wider Empire, (2) a landscape study of the hoard findspots and archaeological evidence for Roman Britain in the 3rd century AD; and (3) reasons for the deposition of metalwork in the Iron Age and Roman periods. The key outputs will include a monograph, at least 5 peer-reviewed articles, 2 conferences (the papers of which will be published), two exhibitions, articles for popular magazines and a web-based hoards database. The project will build on discoveries made by members of the public and reported through the Portable Antiquities Scheme to provide a comprehensive study of coin hoarding in Britain in the 3rd century AD, set in a wider context, and will also address key wider questions relevant for understanding coin hoards in other periods.","While this research will have considerable interest for and impact on the audiences outlined below, it can also be seen as having 'reverse impact': the impact of discoveries made by members of the public on our understanding of Roman Britain and ancient hoarding. Almost all of the coin hoards to be studied have been found by non professionals, especially metal detector users. Recording and conserving these hoards has involved a considerable investment of time from the staff of the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) and museums; time funded by the UK taxpayer and the Lottery. This project will demonstrate the research dividend from such investment, while also seeking to encourage greater use of such information by research students and academics in the future. This research will help answer the questions asked by finders and funders about what these discoveries actually tell us about the past. We have identified the following groups as those who will most benefit from this research. 1. Professional archaeologists and heritage managers, for whom the main benefits will be: - the monograph which will provide a definitive study of hoarding in Britain in the later 3rd century AD , the proceedings of the two conferences and the articles in peer-reviewed journals and popular magazines and  - the online database of hoards which will provide a resource available to everyone and which will be kept up to date by the staff of the PAS and BM after the end of the project. 2. Museum curators and education officers: - Roman coin hoards are acquired and cared for by museums, where they are frequently on public display. For example, the Frome Hoard is a prominent feature of the new Museum of Somerset. This research will provide information to inform how these hoards are displayed in the future and the stories that can be told through such displays, websites and educational material. 3. Metal detector users, local historians and other contributors to the PAS: - This research will help answer common questions from finders and other members of the public about why coin hoards were buried and what they can tell us about Roman Britain. We will feed back the results of this research through articles in metal detecting magazines and talks to detecting and local history groups by PAS staff. - We will emphasise to detector users how much more information can be gained if they do not try to dig hoards out of the ground themselves but allow archaeologists to excavate them. 4. Wider public audiences interested in British archaeology and history: - There is a wide demonstrable interest across different groups in the Roman Britain, as can be seen in the viewing figures for relevant TV programmes, and the attendance at lectures, study days etc. and sales of books. The discovery of Roman coin hoards frequently attracts press coverage and much local interest - for example, the popular book on the Frome Hoard helped raise money for its acquisition. 5. The British Museum and Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS): - Sustaining its partnership with the University of Leicester will contribute to the Museum's strategic aim of extending its research profile; - A key part of the Museum's research plan and the aims of the PAS is to develop its research on PAS and Treasure; - An exhibition of Roman coin hoards will be mounted in the BM and the project will also be featured in a BM touring exhibition. 6. The University of Leicester: - Will benefit from the sharing of data and expertise with the British Museum and PAS; - The School of Archaeology & Ancient History at Leicester has the largest group of staff specialising in Roman archaeology of any UK department, whilst three staff have particular expertise in ancient coinage and this project is of direct relevance to their academic interests; - This project will also help the University develop its existing expertise in investigating of coin hoards in a landscape setting.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK000438%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              'Lost Legacies and a Living Past' is a research network which brings to contemporary attention the remarkable world of medieval science. The network exists to bring together medieval specialists and modern scientists, to create new ways to bring to life the breath-taking scope of medieval thinking on the world, the universe, and the place of man within creation. Putting medievalists and modern scientists together to re-examine medieval scientific texts reminds modern science of its deeper roots, and that a scientific approach to the world around us is older than the recent western scientific tradition suggests. In the Middle Ages the distinction between humanities and science did not exist; both formed part of the same intellectual culture. For medievalists, studying medieval scientific texts afresh alongside modern scientists offers opportunities to reflect on the process of interpretation, translation and presentation, and to confront modern scientific methodologies. The network aims to create the circumstances in which research communities both in humanities and in science can speak to each other, and together unpack the way in which medieval thinkers conceived their world.   More than this, however, the network will take the research on medieval science into the classroom. Educationalists and school teachers focused on science learning at secondary school level will form an integral part of the network. In so doing, further questions will be asked about how the research between medievalists and modern scientists can be shaped for the secondary school curriculum, and help to offer a fuller sense of the history of science. Secondary school history of science starts in its present form with the 17th century. 'Lost Legacies and a Living Past' will open a debate on how to present the importance of the deeper past within the school science curriculum and the benefit of engaging the education communities with research communities. In so doing, the network aims to engage with wider public debate on the nature of science and the role of the past in defining the present and inspiring the future.","The precursor exploratory project to this application, a Durham-based exploratory project on Grosseteste's c. 1225 treatise entitled De colore (On colour), suggests that this multi-disciplinary approach to medieval science writing has wide appeal amongst researchers from a range of disciplines, and from the non-academic community. It is primarily this potential for wider impact of our research that has prompted an application for a Network Grant.   The network will be publicised among the wider academic community, using international consortia such as the Fédération Internationale des Instituts d'Études Mediévales (FIDEM), the Co-operative for the Advancement of Research through a Medieval European Network. It will be similarly communicated within the science research community. The network will build on existing schemes, such as ""Science into Schools"". This is a cross-department programme that runs for final-year science undergraduates at Durham University. As part of their degree programme, students develop science projects whilst on placements hosted within a network of approximately 50 primary and secondary schools in the North East. The network will look to maximize its impact by making use of such existing links, harnessing established ""pathways"".  Through Dr Vanessa Kind, Director of the Science Learning Centre North-East (SLCNE), the network will be advertised to the education community. Those participants external to the research environment will develop, at the Durham meeting, a fuller strategy, with educationalists, as well as specialist research staff in medieval studies and natural science, for the impact of the research undertaken in the network within the classroom. Dr Kind in particular has experience of contributing to changing education policy. She chairs the Royal Society of Chemistry's Education Research Group and is pursuing research associated with teaching the Nature of Science, represented in the England and Wales Science Curriculum as ""How Science Works"". The remit of Science Centre staff is to mediate the impact of current research into the teaching environment. It aims to support teachers and technicians in enhancing their professional skills by learning more about contemporary scientific ideas, experimenting with effective teaching approaches and modern scientific techniques.  The network will be supported by a website, which will post regular updates on research progress. The website will be sustained after the life of the grant by the Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies at Durham University. Interest in principle has already been secured from the New Scientist for coverage of the network and the results of the collaborations that will arise. University Research Institutes at Durham have a dedicated press officer, Mr Paul Ging, with whom the PI will work closely in this respect. The poster-exhibition with preliminary results from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives will be hosted for the general public in the Durham World Heritage Visitor Centre. The exhibition will be able to travel between participant institutions, with a similar accent on public access. Both PI and Co-I have experience of managing impact related activity. The PI has recent experience of working with regional business and cultural institutions, including Durham Cathedral (organizing workshops with Cathedral staff and congregation on how to talk about medieval attitudes to prayer and the bible) and Blackfriars Restaurant, Newcastle (lending expertise on medieval culture and food, as the restaurant develops a commercial medieval menu, and an outreach element in the form of a termly lecture series). This last venture has been covered in the New Statesman. The Co-I has experience liaising with scientists and schools to enhance science teaching, both through the Science into Schools project, and through Royal Society Partnership Grants. She has also contributed to BBC Horizon and an exhibition at the Science Museum.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK003658%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Making Sand Dunes Public (MSDP) is an experimental project exploring ways to build trust and support for coastal management by engaging and enrolling local publics centrally in practical decisions concerning the management and planning of sand dunes as a natural form of coastal defence. It starts from the premise that current complex environmental problems, such as those related to climate change, require new, more creative approaches to environmental decision making. These will necessitate more inclusionary process, incorporating many currently neglected and unheard voices, constituencies and forms of evidence within processes that build understanding, exchange and trust in times of environmental uncertainty.  The project is developed through a partnership with the Norfolk County Council (NCC) ENDURE (Ensuring Dune Resilience against Climate Change) project team which emerged in the later stages of the AHRC funded project Listening to Climate Change: experiments in sonic democracy (public facing title Sounding Coastal Change (SCC) (AH/P000126/1 01/09/2016 - 30/06/2019). ENDURE is a 2.1m Euro European funded project with partners in the UK (Norfolk), Belgium, France and the Netherlands. It aims to 'look at establishing sand dunes as adaptive, living sea defences'. Many traditional concrete sea defences are old and failing and can be expensive or challenging to maintain. Natural ecosystems can provide better, more resilient protection. However, building trust and collaboration with localities at an individual community level to develop and encourage natural sand dune systems remains both problematic. In North Norfolk this is reflected at two dune sites in particular: Holme-next-the-Sea and Brancaster. MSDP will partner with ENDURE to develop a workshop programme and facilitate a series of local public and community engagements which involve users and local publics in co-producing future management strategies for these key coastal dunes sites The project builds on key aspects of methodology developed in public engagement work involving SCC and the Norfolk Coast Partnership (NCP) who produce the 5-year statutory management plan for the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). NCP will co-partner MSDP and NCC as part of their remit in increase public engagement in the AONB planning process. Building trust through local involvement, in environmental policy and management has been highlighted as a key national issue in the current period of climate change and uncertainty. MSDP contributes to developing the mutual understandings, shared knowledge bases and co-created solutions that are fundamental to building resilience and ongoing and flexible adaptation strategies for coastal locations. These become increasingly vital in the face of sea level rises, increased flooding, inundation and more volatile coastlines resultant from climate change. Aims and Objectives * Develop and facilitate a series of workshops and events at the two north Norfolk sand dune sites in order to improve the cooperation between site managers, the local community, visitors and local businesses;  * Involve neglected and unheard voices, constituencies and multiple forms of evidence within processes that build understanding, exchange and trust in the management of the sand dunes; * Engage schools, volunteers, local groups and publics in devising, implementing and taking responsibility for dune management plans; * Explore, trial and develop a new facilitated collaborative working methodology for environmental engagement involving local schools, volunteers, groups, publics, environmental and conservation groups with environmental and planning professionals;",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV004832%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Mental Health and Learning Disabilities: Heritage and Stigma will bring together a number of projects on the history of mental health care. The University of Huddersfield will work with local charities (St Anne's and Mencap) and the South West Yorkshire Partnership, a regional NHS Foundation Trust, to actively engage a range of stakeholders in the development, delivery and dissemination of the project. At the centre of this project will be current service users who will contribute to both the design of individual projects and their successful delivery. The partners will work together so that they will ensure the long term legacy of their projects. This will include exhibitions in the short term but also the development and delivery of teaching and learning materials. Both will exploit resources held by the West Yorkshire Archive Service. These resources will be developed with a wide ranging audience in mind. They will be used, not only to understand the longer term story of mental health care but also address the stigma associated with mental ill health and learning disabilities in the past and in the present.","The rationale for this project is a timely one. Research published in 2009 concluded that there is still a huge stigma associated with mental illness (O'Hara, 2009, Boseley, 2009). Similarly, the focus for historians and non-historians alike has often been the dark side of Victorian asylums. The headline in The Times (Deer, 1985) that spoke of 'the stark lessons from a scrapheap hospital' when a number of elderly patients died of food poisoning, echoed the Museums of Madness title of Andrew Scull's 'magisterial' (Smith, 1999) historical monograph. Headlines alone can enforce stereotypes and this collaborative project offers an opportunity for a large number of people to look again at the history of what can be an emotive subject. This joint working initiative will enable community groups to explore the longer term heritage behind the 'hidden' histories of mental ill health (St Anne's) and learning disability (Mencap). While the primary impact will relate to the stakeholders identified in the original AOS bids, the development of additional teaching and learning resources stemming from these individual resources will ensure both a much wider impact and an ongoing legacy. The outputs will be made available to members of the general public, educational and community groups and trainee and current practitioners working in the field of mental health. The PI currently works as a Visiting Research Fellow at the South West Yorkshire Partnership, NHS Foundation Trust and discussions have shown that there is a demand for such resources. This is reflected in the Trust's support for the project and the work will feed into the Trust's Creative Minds Agenda http://www.southwestyorkshire.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Creative-Minds.pdf In addition, it will have an impact upon the groups identified by raising awareness of the past and present experience of those with mental health conditions and learning difficulties inside and outside of institutions; by helping to build positive images, especially amongst school children, of these groups; and by providing an important context for practitioners to help in their professional development. Finally the partnership will bring together voluntary and statutory service providers with academics and the heritage sector to broaden the potential opportunities to reach a wider professional and general public.

"Funding details                                                                                                              From the 1880s to the 1980s British excavations in Egypt resulted in the discovery of tens of thousands of ancient Egyptian objects. This included unique discoveries at iconic sites such as the tombs of Egypt's first rulers at Abydos, the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri, the ancient city of Tell el-Amarna and vast animal cemeteries at Saqqara. A large proportion of the recovered objects, however, were distributed to an estimated 200 museums around the world before they were fully documented or published. Consequently, before any proper analysis of these excavations can be undertaken, considerable research time has to be invested in identifying where objects are so that they can be studied. To date, such searches have been piecemeal, dependent upon a researcher's regional or chronological interests. 'Artefacts of Excavation' is a more ambitious project that will create a valuable central resource for the relocation and re-contextualization of these objects, and will seek to transform our understanding of the role of these distributions in the development of archaeology and museology. By charting the nature of the relationships between objects, people and places that were created through a century of finds distribution from British excavations in Egypt we will transform our understandings of the historically contingent construction of ancient Egypt in museums and of the disciplinary development of archaeology and museology from both a global and local perspective. These goals will be achieved by documenting for the first time the scope, scale and complexity of these distributions. This will be made possible by the skills of the project team, who will bring together their knowledge and experience of Egyptian archaeology, museum practice, digital technologies and archival research to bring dispersed collections back together virtually in a central, publicly accessible online resource that will enhance the potential for curatorial work with these collections. In so doing this project will provide a model of knowledge exchange between archaeological specialists and museum practitioners, which in turn will be of cultural benefit to the public through improved displays and collections information. It will also directly benefit archaeologists working in the field in Egypt, including our Egyptian colleagues, who are today re-excavating many of the key sites previously examined, but which were largely unpublished or else only partially published, by previous generations of British fieldworkers. Investigation of such finds distribution will make it possible to examine the local, national, international, and colonial identities that were negotiated as different people and institutions vied for a share of excavated material and sought to influence the direction of work in Egypt itself. Such excavations were largely conducted at a time when the colonial project saw museum institutions established across the globe, while collections expanded considerably, but it was also the period that witnessed the establishment of archaeology as an academic discipline. By exploring the distribution of objects from excavations to museums, and the voluminous correspondence that accompanied these exchanges, this project will challenge the commonly held view that excavation in the field and museum work formed two areas of practice and through archival research demonstrate their symbiotic relationship. We will explore the processes of 'artefaction' that occurred both in the field in Egypt and in museums, in which Egyptian objects transformed from their 17th-19th century status of individual curios to polyvalent artefacts whose meaning was socially constructed through shifting links to specific places, objects, people, and institutions. Through detailed case studies of 9 different institutions across the UK, Commonwealth, and the globe these complex relations can be explored, transforming how we understand contemporary attitudes to the Egyptian past.","Beneficiaries:  (a) The major beneficiaries of this research outside of academia will be public museums not only in the UK, but also across Europe and the world - an estimated 200 institutions. There are 112 museums in the UK alone that curate many thousands of objects acquired during British excavations in Egypt (Serpico 2006). A scoping exercise conducted in July 2012 in preparation for this proposal established that outside of the UK at least a further 80 institutions hold objects from such fieldwork (Stevenson in review). Correspondence with curators across the world shows that there is great interest in acquiring more information about the objects in their care and for the resources to help identify, contextualise and interpret artefacts sent to their institutions over the course of the last century. We will engage those who manage such collections at the outset of the project through direct email contact in order to establish what information would be most useful to them on the project website. This will open a dialogue with such museum professionals to establish what objects they curate and share information about the background context to these objects and their acquisition in Egypt. Such knowledge exchange can, in turn, inform external museums' own collections management and documentation of these collections. In this process the website will be a fundamental portal of knowledge exchange providing information on sites, excavators and transcriptions of archives in London, Boston and elsewhere (e.g. Philadelphia) that relate to the distribution of collections around the world and can facilitate identification of objects in collections. This information will allow museums to more effectively respond to research enquiries about their Egyptian collections and use them creatively in Education (e.g. for key state 2 history) and public exhibitions.  (b) The public will also be major cultural beneficiaries. Objects often found their way into collections through the activities of local individuals. Stories of distribution of how Egyptian objects came to be in places as far flung as Aberdeen and Cape Town offer a dynamic way of reconnecting the public to artefacts in their local museums. We will seek to identify individual biographies that have resonance with communities in which Egyptian objects are now located and link these to wider histories. These object biographies will be a feature of the project's website. We will also host a series of public events in the Pitt Rivers Museum and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and the Egypt Exploration Society, London and Cairo, to engage the public. These will include public talks, object handling sessions, and a temporary (potentially touring) exhibition pulling together object, documentary and photographic materials that illustrate the history of British excavations in Egypt. By liaising with museum curators, promotion through events in and outside the museum, we will encourage individuals beyond the project team to submit object biographies of Egyptian objects in other museum collections that can be hosted on the website.  (c) Students in the University of Oxford and in Museum Studies more generally will be beneficiaries through numerous opportunities to volunteer in various aspects of the project's activities, including voluntary experience within the Ashmolean Museum as objects are prepared for incorporation in the website's resources and their contextualization is recorded as examples of how to link excavated collections with archives and published excavation reports. In this way individuals will gain valuable experience in working in Museum environments, enhancing future job prospects for some of them by developing transferable and employable skills. There will also be opportunities to contribute to the website content by authoring object biographies",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL004569%2F1

In the shadow of debates about the social and cultural legacy of the London Olympic Games and in light of the prospect of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the project will help a diverse range of people from the community to explore the nature of sport in the community and how it has changed over time. Through a focus on the meaning of sports heritage for different generations in the community, the research will deepen our understanding of how Glasgow's past links to its future. The research and community heritage project seeks to engage local sports clubs in inter-generational heritage research with primary school children. The project will explore the history and meaning of sport in communities through intergenerational collaboration between the academic researcher, primary school children and experienced members of Glasgow Southside's sports community. The research will reflect on the process of intergenerational heritage activities to inform future cultural histories of sport, and future wellbeing. It will contribute to the AHRC's theme 'Care for the Future' through a focus on interpreting cultural and social change in Glasgow sport, as well affording opportunities to examine the usefulness of intergenerational communication in community settings. The project will investigate the cultural transmission of sporting cultures of the past, and its influence over, or disconnection from, contemporary sporting practices of young people. Specifically, it will explore the connections between sport and its heritage in the community among local sports clubs and school children aged between 8 and 12. It aims to enable sports clubs to connect with the wider community, in order to explore the sporting heritage themes, including places, organisations and people, with the objective of exploring the meaning of local heritage in the community. The project intends to open up access to the film holdings of Scottish Screen Archive and other media archives for use in sports heritage projects. School children and sports clubs will be given guidance on the value of film and printed media in heritage projects, and how to interpret media as part of heritage activity. Led by the academic researcher, school children will visit the sites and relics of community sports based in Glasgow. This will encourage children to learn about the history of different clubs and venues and develop a sensory mapping of local sports culture and heritage sites. Drawing on intergenerational encounters and the field research school children will engage in a digital cultural mapping using Google Maps and other social media such as Pinterest on iPads, in order to share knowledge and experience of local sports heritage. The heritage activity will be curated online and process evaluated for its contribution to community learning. The heritage project will have the added value of creating a sense of shared pride in the area's sporting history and identity and help bring together diverse parts of the community - in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and socio-economic difference - to produce sustainable connections, positive social values around sport and provide inspiration for other community heritage groups in this field. The researcher will collaborate with other award holders investigating Care for the Future to explore the lessons learned from the research and the share experiences with the theme network through online materials and attendance at AHRC-led workshops to enhance the wider academic impact of the research.","The project has a direct social impact through collaborative engagement with Glasgow sporting communities, as well as intergenerational heritage work with young people in the Shawlands Learning Community in the Southside of Glasgow. More specifically, the research will have a wider impact on the following public policy areas and educational and cultural practices: Heritage and Public Policy: The public engagement with community sports clubs links directly in to local, regional and national initiatives around sports development, as well as a more immediate link to policies on Olympic legacy from London 2012. It will also be of interest to sports development and heritage divisions of Glasgow Life, the cultural department of Glasgow City Council, as well as those involved in sports development and legacies of Glasgow 2014, the organising body of the Commonwealth Games. The research on community sport in Glasgow will be of interest to the national agency for sport, Sport Scotland, as well as Scottish Disability Sport and the Scottish Association of Local Sports Councils. The activities centred on the use of sports film will be of direct interest to the outreach and educational division of Scottish Screen Archive which is part of the National Library of Scotland. The research will have a wider relevance to local authorities who manage both sports development and heritage in their communities, and will provide evidence of how intergenerational projects can form part of wider social policy initiatives related to health and wellbeing for the future. Community Sports Policy and Practice: The research will directly engage those working in the third sector for community amateur sports clubs. The connections made between sports clubs and schools will greatly benefit the visibility of sport in the community, raising the profile and development of particular clubs, as well as fostering long-term relationships which can grow after the life of the research. The evaluation of the project will be made available to key stakeholders in grassroots sport, including the Sport and Recreation Alliance, the umbrella organisation for the governing and representative bodies of sport and recreation in the UK which has more than 300 members. Educational Practice: The intergenerational project will involve public engagement with schools in the Shawlands Learning Community located in the Southside of the city of Glasgow. This includes eleven primary schools and one secondary school. The project will help develop awareness of both sport and heritage in Glasgow among young people, in particular focusing on the role and function of amateur community sports clubs in the Southside of the city. The planned research recognizes the value of media and sport education as an essential component in the social inclusion of young people in their communities, helping the development of cultural citizenship, media literacy and self-esteem. It is also of potential value in opening up new ways of raising the profile and status of Scottish sports archives to new audiences.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK005367%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The aim of the project is to understand firstly how to enable a wider range of audiences to participate in a more diverse film culture that embraces the wealth of films beyond the mainstream; and secondly how to optimise the cultural value of engaging with those less familiar films, identified here as 'specialised' films. We will do this by investigating how audiences engage with and form around specialised films in four English regions. Audience formation is here understood as the processes of engagement with films that generate audience experiences. Drawing on industry definitions, specialised films are understood as films outside the mainstream, including small scale UK films, foreign language, documentary, archive and hard-to-pigeonhole films, and films with unconventional narratives, themes or cinematic techniques. Provision of mainstream film is good across England; however, provision of specialised films is low across the English regions outside London, which limits the opportunities for people to experience a more diverse film culture. We need to know more about the provision of specialised films in those regions, and how audiences form in relation to specialised film provision. Although audience reception studies have made audiences increasingly visible within academic debate and although the industry and policy makers also gather intelligence about audiences, little attention has been paid to the specific contextual relationships and interactions between media and people that generate and sustain audiences in English regions. Audience policy for specialised films takes a regional approach in attempting to improve provision and create a more diverse film culture. Our project aims to provide a firm evidence base for such policy developments by establishing a detailed understanding of how audiences form in their engagement with specialised films, the extent to which they are committed to film cultural diversity and the role that regional identity plays in that process. To achieve these aims requires an holistic approach that addresses the details of consumption and the opportunities to consume, namely the provision of film at a regional level, including online. The goal is both to advance scholarship and to provide concrete recommendations about how UK audience policies can be improved. This focused, comprehensive and impactful project will explore the relationship between audiences and specialised films by examining the practices of venue-based and online film consumption, how different audiences experience specialised films, and the value of venues in the regional provision of film. It will also address the provision of specialised film by examining the industry processes of funding, production, distribution and exhibition (including online) of specialised films in four English regions. The audience research will involve a multilevel comparative study of audience formation in relation to specialised films in four English regions, collecting data that is in depth and at scale and using innovative digital humanities analytical methods. Following an earlier pilot study (http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/fhn), we have developed a highly experienced interdisciplinary team to undertake this project, comprised of academic experts in film studies, sociology, cultural policy, digital humanities and partners from film policy and the film industry. Through a partnership with the British Film Institute's (BFI) Film Audience Network and the Film Hubs (which organise provision of specialised film and foster audience participation regionally), the project is designed to have direct impact on the BFI's efforts to improve regional audience figures, widen film choice, and enhance the cultural benefits of specialised film. The project will therefore establish a strong relationship between the scholarly understanding of audiences and the development of official audience policies and industry practices in the context of regional provision.","We aim to achieve impact within the British film industry through a programme of research that directly supports the work of the British Film Institute (BFI) Film Audience Network (FAN). FAN is composed of the nine Film Hubs which cover the whole of the UK. The aim of FAN is to position 'specialised film' as a recognisable, valued and important part of people's cultural lives. FAN seeks to achieve this by a) developing a larger, more diverse and sustainable audience for specialised film and b) creating a more confident sector for the distribution and exhibition of specialised film. Our project will help FAN and the industry sector address these two objectives by providing evidence (raw data and research outputs), tools for conducting their own analysis of the data (the online interface), and a methodology for conducting similar audience studies involving quantitative and qualitative data (the ontology). If funded, the project is timely because its findings will feed in to the BFI's next round of planning for the continuation of FAN beyond 2017. Our pathway to impact is targeted at the strategic level and the applied level.  The project is thus designed to have a direct impact on the BFI's efforts to improve regional audience figures, widen film choice, and enhance the cultural benefits of specialised film. More generally, the project is designed to inform and influence the specialised film sector, industry leaders and stakeholders through a series of impact activities that make use of the audience data and the search and visualisation tools and assist them with their decision making processes at regional and national levels. One aspect of the impact plan will be to run a series of workshops that use the project's digital deliverables as part of a Delphi Methodology to influence policy development. The project will thus establish a strong relationship between the scholarly understanding of audiences and the development of official audience policies and industry practices in the context of regional provision.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP005780%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Imagination, the capacity to detach ourselves from the here and now, to recollect the past, anticipate the future and enter the worlds of art and science, is a key human capacity. For most of us the ability to visualise is a conspicuous component of imagination, but the vividness of visual imagery turns out to vary greatly between individuals. In previous work we have described individuals with lifelong lack of a 'mind's eye' - or 'aphantasia' - which affects around 2% of the population; conversely, some individuals have exceptionally vivid imagery, or 'hyperphantasia'. During the life of our AHRC-funded project 'The eye's mind - a study of the neural basis of visual imagination and of its role in culture', which ran from 1.1.15 - 31.5.16, world-wide publicity surrounding the description of aphantasia led to over 10,000 spontaneous contacts from individuals with 'extreme imagination', including a substantial number of aphantasic artists, writers and architects. Many of our contacts rejoiced that we had named and were investigating a central but elusive characteristic of their inner lives. This project responds to their enthusiasm and strongly expressed desire for more extensive information, and will be developed in collaboration with those who have contacted us. Our project aims to help individuals whose imagery lies at the extreme of the vividness spectrum to interact and build supportive communities. It will publicise and celebrate creative work produced by individuals at these extremes, and enable researchers working on aspects of imagery to communicate recent discoveries about the experience, psychological function and neural basis of imagery in visual and other domains. It will provide an opportunity to explore the relevance of extreme imagery to education, therapy and creative endeavour. Finally it will provide a springboard for future work on topics considered important by those in these communities. To realise these aims, we will work with people with aphantasia and hyperphantasia who have contacted us to design, for the first time ever, a major conference, intended as an opportunity for people with 'extreme imagination' to build a community and exchange experiences and ideas with imagery researchers. A touring exhibition and illustrated catalogue (Phantasia: art and science) will celebrate the creative work of individuals with extreme imagery, outline current understanding of how the brain enables imagery, and reflect on the complex relationship between imagery and imagination. There will be educational and cultural events at each of the exhibition venues in Norwich, Exeter and Glasgow, the centres involved in the Eye's Mind project. The project will be overseen by the original Eye's Mind team, and material from the conference, exhibition and local events will be made widely available through our website http://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/research/neuroscience/theeyesmind/. The remarkable response to date to the Eye's Mind project, with over 10,000 email contacts, has demonstrated that individuals with aphantasia and hyperphantasia are delighted that a distinctive feature of their experience has been recognised, named and investigated. Most of our participants have expressed a wish to learn more about the nature and basis of their experience and about imagery in general; many have specifically expressed interest in a conference. This project will satisfy this appetite and disseminate knowledge of these extreme forms of imagery experience more widely. It will enable people with aphantasia and hyperphantasia to build communities, and begin to explore the implications of these imagery extremes in practical contexts, especially in education and therapy. More generally, it will contribute to the public appreciation of the diversity of our inner lives, of the many routes to creativity, and of a fascinating area of interdisciplinary research.","The primary beneficiaries of this research will be individuals with aphantasia and hyperphantasia whose imagery experience lies at the extremes of the vividness spectrum. 10,000 such individuals have already been in touch with us: their responses overwhelmingly indicate relief and delight that a distinctive but poorly understood feature of their experience has been recognised, named and investigated. Our conference will enable a substantial group of such individuals to meet, share experiences and interact with imagery researchers. Through this project, we will help our delegates, and individuals with extreme imagery generally, to build a supportive and informative community. Publicity surrounding the conference, including advance information and subsequent podcasts on our website, will disseminate knowledge of extreme imagery beyond our current contacts and participants. The associated exhibition will reveal that aphantasia is no bar to creativity, and celebrate the creative achievements of individuals whose experience lies at each extreme of the vividness spectrum.  We have been contacted by numerous practitioners, working as teachers, lecturers and therapists, who have become aware of the impact of extreme imagery on their pupils, students and clients. This project will raise awareness of aphantasia and hyperphantasia among such practitioners, with eventual benefits to educational and therapeutic techniques.  There is wide interest among the general public in the diversity of human experience, the origins of creativity and the neural basis of imagination, all of which are major themes of our conference, exhibition and associated events. The project will entertain, interest and educate this wider audience. Finally, while this project is not primarily directed at an academic audience, researchers in the humanities (literary criticism, art history, philosophy, theology), the sciences (psychology, cognitive neuroscience, clinical psychology) and educational theory have signalled interest in our work and will benefit from the maintenance and development of our data base and website which will support the primary, public-facing, objectives of this project.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FR004684%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Pacific barkcloth is a little known but fascinating, beautiful and meaningful material. Barkcloth is made from the inner bark of the paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) and other plants, beaten to soften and expand it into a fabric. It was traditionally used for clothing, furnishings, ceremonial practice and all other 'textile' purposes in the Pacific islands until the 19th century. There are several significant collections of Pacific barkcloth in European, north American and Australasian museums, but there are also innumerable small museums and historic houses in the UK and around the world which contain barkcloth, from just one piece to a small collection, relics of Pacific travel by local 18th and 19th century explorers, scientists, missionaries and administrators.  A recent project, Situating Pacific Barkcloth Production in Time and Place, brought together researchers from Pacific art history, materials science and conservation practice to investigate what a close study of barkcloth as a material can tell us. The project has given us new insights into the materials used to make barkcloth, including the introduction of new methods of identifying the plant fibre which was previously extremely challenging. We also now have, for example, a much better understanding of the effect of the different stages of manufacture on the properties of the finished cloth and how this varied across the Pacific. The project results make it possible to provide information in a more accessible form and we will hold five workshops in museums in England and Scotland to engage a wider audience with this fascinating material. The host museums have expert staff with specific collections knowledge and significant collections which will provide reference material for the workshops. The involvement of two practitioners from American Samoa will be vital to the workshops' success: Reggie Meredith Fitiao and Uilisone Fitiao have extensive experience of traditional and contemporary barkcloth making and design. Their involvement in the original project demonstrated the enormous value of working with people for whom this practice has a real, contemporary significance. They will lead the workshops, creating a dynamic link between objects in a museum display case and the living tradition of barkcloth making. The two-day events will cater for different audiences. On Day 1 curators from local and regional museums and historic houses who do not have specialist knowledge of barkcloth will participate in a workshop aimed at raising awareness of its significance, materials, manufacture, decoration, use and history. This will give them context to understand their own collections and the resources, skills and inspiration to make their barkcloth pieces accessible to their visitors and to use them as the basis for engaging activities. This will also encourage further displays of barkcloth, and a greater regional understanding of collections through the formation of networks of interested museum staff. On Day 2 the curators will be invited to take part in a workshop for the general public at the host museum. The workshops will include a demonstration of beating the inner bark, the opportunity to handle the raw materials and modern barkcloths and beaters and interactive activity replicating on paper some of the designs found on barkcloth using traditional methods of painting, stencilling, printing using bamboo sticks and leaves or rubbing over a raised design. Visitors will learn that the meaning of the designs is more complex and has greater significance than is at first apparent. This will encourage museums to broaden the range of their engagement activities beyond the core areas of natural history and European art, enabling adults and children to gain an understanding of the natural history, artistic skill and cultural significance of this probably novel material.","The project will engage two specific groups: Non-specialist museum curators and access and learning staff It is notable that specialist fora, such as the Museum Ethnographers Group conference hosted by the project in 2017, mainly attract those who already have a knowledge of world cultures material. This project aims to give tools and resources to the much larger number of non-specialist curators in local and regional museums around the UK, helping them better understand their collections, inspiring and enthusing them to work with these particular artefacts and enabling greater access to collections for the general public through specific activities and also by putting more barkcloth on display. This group includes curators working in historic houses, for the National Trust, for example. The workshops will host 10 curators from each region. Travel and accommodation costs will be met for the participants, an important factor for regional museums where funding is scarce. The workshop participants will find out more about barkcloth artefacts, with the opportunity to learn about their manufacture, use, meaning and provenance. Basing the discussions around the host collection will root the information in locally significant stories and identify artefacts with shared provenance. Curators will have the opportunity to work with the RA to disseminate significant artefacts and interesting stories on the museums' websites and other dissemination channels. Artefacts will also be added to the project database, so reaching a wider audience. The curators will benefit from contact with specialist staff and collections in their region, creating a more sustainable network for the future. Advice on storage, packing and conservation treatment will also be available from the PI. Learning and access staff will be able to re-use the materials and knowledge gained from the public workshops to design further educational materials and activities for schools and other communities. Feedback collected from the workshops will assess the degree to which the participants enhanced their level of understanding and identify successful and less successful methods of engagement; this will be of value to the museums as they develop further events.  General public While exhibitions and publications on Pacific material and barkcloth tend to attract enthusiasts and art lovers, this new project aims at exposing Pacific barkcloth to a much wider audience of adults, students and children, the local community and tourists, based in local museums. Adults, perhaps attracted by the opportunity to share a fun and educational interactive experience with their children, are just as likely to encounter a new material which they have not previously encountered. The host museums are all in university cities and would provide new insights for students of social anthropology, museum studies and material culture. For all groups, an understanding of the way barkcloth is made will highlight human ingenuity in creating useful and beautiful artefacts from seemingly unpromising materials. Key messages will be the uncovering of the symbolic meaning in the apparently simple patterns, along with an understanding of the skill of making and an appreciation of the artistic values involved in the design. The involvement of the American Samoan practitioners will underline the importance of this material to their history and culture. Feedback will be collected from the workshops as a means of iteratively enhancing the workshops themselves and the resources created for the museums. The information gained will be disseminated to museum staff to enhance future activities.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS012435%2F1

Learning disabled and autistic people are amongst the most marginalised and voice-less within our society. They are often perceived as vulnerable and requiring protection or care, while rarely having a prominent voice within public discourses, even with issues that directly relate to disability. The disability arts are a rare forum where these relationships are challenged, with learning disabled and autistic artists utilising their creativity to assert their agency and identity. I'm Me will be conducted in collaboration with Mind the Gap (MTG) and in partnership with a network of six disability arts companies. Through this network, learning disabled and autistic artists will act as peer and creative researchers, alongside two learning disabled Peer Research Associates. Together we will explore, critique, subvert and reconstitute questions of learning disability identity, representation and voice. We will work through a reflexive methodology based on the 'Creative Doodle Book', a resource that uses open and playful tasks to encourage reflective self-expression. This approach was tested between 2019-21 when the Doodle Book was used extensively with learning disability groups across the UK, developing a resource that enables the exploration of challenging and complex issues, such as identity, in an inclusive manner. Through this approach the perceptions, insights and creative understandings of the peer researchers will be at the heart of both the process and the outcomes. The project has three distinct phases. Phase 1 will create a revised version of the Doodle Book in collaboration with MTG and the Peer Research Network. Alongside this we will work with access champions Totally Inclusive People to co-create a series of three 12-week peer research cycles. Facilitators and artists from each of the partner companies will be trained in the delivery of these resources. Phase 2 will deliver these peer research cycles at each of the partner companies. This process will elicit understandings of how learning disabled and autistic adults view questions of identity and representation, and from this work towards greater understandings of self-advocacy, agency and voice. Through open tasks that elicit multiple ways of expression, the process will develop creative forms of insider testimonies that will include written, spoken, visual and other non-verbal materials. Phase 3 will focus on the production of creative outputs by learning disabled and autistic artists that draw upon the testimonies and insights from across the whole Peer Research Network. The partner companies and the participating artists will be supported by creative producers from MTG to develop their reflective insights into public facing art works and documentations. A learning disability led team will utilise these to construct a book and curate a two-day I'm Me Festival, each designed to communicate the insights and lived experiences from the project. It is anticipated that these will include art works, spoken word, personal narrative, documentary film and live performance. Crucial to this stage will be the involvement of learning disabled and autistic artists in editorial, authorial and curatorial processes and decision making.  The outcomes of the project will include: 1) A new model for peer research with learning disabled and autistic participants. 2) Greater understanding of how identity, representation and voice are understood by learning disabled and autistic adults. 3) Impactful, outward-facing materials that shift public perceptions, provide resources for support agencies in training and education, and evidence the value of engaging learning disabled and autistic voices in research, public discourse and policy.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX003760%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project follows on from my AHRC Fellowship which focussed on how Latin(o) American online cultural producers represent key locations in Latin America in their works. In the course of researching my Fellowship, which fell under the AHRC's Digital Transformations highlight, I identified 3 particular trends: firstly, the practices of tactical media, whereby Latin(o) American new media artists employ digital technologies against the grain; secondly, the fact that online technologies are often employed to represent offline place; and thirdly, that new media art combines digital participation with offline intervention. These 3 findings now inform the current proposal, which will enable me to communicate these findings to a wide range of stakeholders and to put into practice these concepts in a series of workshops, collaborative events and exhibitions. This new proposed project builds upon my previous research, but moves beyond the realm of academic research. Over the course of the year, a series of forms of collaboration, engagement and impact will be held involving 4 principal groups: third sector community media organizations; art galleries and museums; artists and cultural producers; and spectators and audiences.  The project aims, firstly, to draw out interconnections between the digital art examined in the previous Fellowship and other regional and national contexts, enabling the sharing of ideas between Latin(o) American new media artists and third sector collaborative media projects in Liverpool. Secondly, the project aims to foster and exhibit art works that reach out beyond the usual contours of cultural-artistic practice, encouraging participatory digital art works with spectators enabled as active co-creators. Thirdly, the project aims to bridge the gap between social media and cultural-artistic practice to encourage reflective use of social media as potential feedback loops for artistic and curatorial practice.Fourthly, the project aims to address the existing gap in curatorial practice in new media festivals in the UK, in which Latin(o) Americans are currently under-represented, and so raise the profile of these artists, bring their work to a UK audience, and provide for innovative forms of engagement with their practice. In order to achieve these aims, the project plans a series of activities structured over the course of an 11-month period. These include a 2-month Artist in Residence Scheme, held jointly at the University of Liverpool and FACT art gallery; an original artwork developed by the artist; a visit of 3 further Invited Artists for a shorter, 10-day period; an exhibition, entitled Cities in Dialogue, at the Independents Liverpool Biennial, 2014; and a series of shared themed workshops with the Liverpool-based community media projects, Veterans in Practice, Tenantspin and Freehand. The project will also trial throughout the year open-ended participatory audience platforms making use of social media, which will be integrated into the workshops, exhibition and Residency mentioned above, but also continuing beyond these.  The project also includes 3 written outputs, comprising firstly the Programme Notes to accompany the Cities in Dialogue exhibition for the Independents Liverpool Biennial 2014, which will include interviews with the artists, contextual information about their practice, and an introduction to the works in the exhibition. The second written output is a Retrospective volume on the exhibition targeted at a general audience, and including introductory pieces explaining the context, interviews with the artists, conversations with the third sector organizations, observations of the works in progress and colour photographs of the works. The third written output will be a short Policy Document for FACT, the Independents Liverpool Biennial and other new media and contemporary art venues, summing up the main findings during the course of the project.","The impact strategies for this project provide for collaboration, engagement and impact involving 4 principal groups of beneficiaries: third sector community media organizations; art galleries and museums; spectators and audiences; and artists and cultural producers.  The third sector community media organizations comprise principally, although are not limited to, VIP, a digital arts project working with military veterans; Freehand, a programme for young people; and Tenantspin, a community media group for social housing tenants. Anticipated benefits for this group are: opportunities to feed into the collaborative art work developed by the AiR; learning about and sharing best practice in new media; an increased awareness of the uses of social media for cultural expression; and taking ownership of social media platforms beyond the lifetime of the grant. Wider benefits for these groups also include contributions to health and wellbeing; for instance, the VIP project functions as part of the Liverpool Veterans wellbeing programme which aims for a holistic approach to wellbeing through cultural participation, and so leads to improvement in quality of life for its participants. The beneficiary art galleries and art institutions involve particularly, although not exclusively, FACT, the UK's leading media arts centre, and the Independents Liverpool Biennial, the UK's largest contemporary art festival. Anticipated benefits for this group include: a broader geographical spread of artists within their exhibitions and spaces; the opportunity to showcase innovative participatory works; opportunities for longer term collaboration with the artists beyond the lifetime of the grant; increased publicity for both institutions through the events and Retrospective volume; and insights from the policy document which will help with forward planning of future digital media interventions. Again, there are also wider benefits arising; for instance, FACT is a member of LARC (Liverpool Arts Regeneration Consortium), and the proposed collaborations, in particular the dialogues with and uses of city spaces by the artists, will feed into LARC's aim of the cultural sector playing a significant role in the regeneration of the Liverpool city region and quality of life. Moreover, the sharing of the policy document with a range of other new media and contemporary art institutions nationally and internationally will ensure benefits are not limited to the two named institutions, and will have a reach well beyond Liverpool. The beneficiary audiences and festival-goers comprise those attending the Liverpool Biennial 2014 and those visiting FACT's galleries. Benefits for this particular group include: a greater knowledge of Latin(o) American new media art; an increased participatory role with works of art; the opportunity to engage in real-time comment and feedback on the works; the opportunity to observe the work in progress of the AiR; an enhanced understanding of new media arts; the opportunity to hear about the works and their context from the PI, AiR and Invited Artists' talks and the programme notes. The beneficiary artists comprise principally the AiR and the Invited Artists, although broader benefits for the wider Latin(o) American digital art community are envisaged. Benefits for the artists include: the opportunity to gain greater exposure; the ability to construct a higher profile within UK new media circuits; the chance to share best practice; and the opportunity for sustained engagement with each other's work around a clear shared theme.  In addition to these named beneficiaries, due to the multiple forms of dissemination and engagement, members of the general public, even those not attending the events in person, will benefit from the opportunity to view the works online, engage in debates and contribute to the social media feedback platforms, access the Exhibition programme notes online and read the retrospective volume.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL012545%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The quality of Roman silver coinage is often taken an an index of the economic health of the empire, with a fall in silver content being taken as an indication of fiscal inadequacy. During the third century AD debased silver coinage came to dominate the currency system of the Roman world, coinciding with a period that historians have dubbed the 'third century crisis'. Between AD 194 and 260 the silver content of the coinage declined from just under 50% to less than 10%, and previous studies have proposed that this decline in quality was almost continuous. By about AD 260 new technologies had to be employed to make the coins look silvery and to disguise the fact that they were made mainly of copper. The continuous decline is thought to signify perpetual fiscal crisis, where revenues and resources could not match Rome's expenditure on its armies. It is generally thought that public confidence in the coinage waned, leading to inflation and the collapse of the monetary system. However, the evidence on which this account of monetary crisis is based is seriously flawed. Until AD 260 Roman mints were able to disguise the extent of debasement by deliberately enhancing the silvery surfaces of the coins using a technique known as depletion silvering, and previous analyses did not take this fact into account. Consequently we do not know anything for certain about the full extent of debasement between AD 194 and 260, or about the frequency of debasement. We do not know whether there were long periods of stability or even improvements during this period. While there can be no doubt that the silver content in AD 260 was much lower than in AD 194, the way in which the decline occurred - and thus the reasons for the decline - remain obscure. Previous work by the applicants on earlier periods have overturned the picture of continuous decline and perpetual fiscal crisis for those periods. It remains to be seen whether one of the cornerstones of the 'third century crisis', the collapse of the coinage, is a sustainable narrative. The aim of the project is to analyse 2,250 Roman silver coins for the period AD 194 to 260, to determine not only the fineness of the coins but also to use minor and trace elements, and lead isotope analyses, to inform us about sources of raw materials and production technology. One explanation for the dramatic fall in the silver content of the coinage is that the Roman empire ran out of stocks of fresh silver. If this is so, evidence of recycling should be readily apparent. In addition, weight standards will also be scrutinised. These are important for drawing comparisons between different denominations of silver coinage, but they are also an important component of the concept of monetary standards. Finally, a study of hoards will look for evidence that the public was aware of changes made to the coinage. The PI and Co-I form a strong interdisciplinary team of archaeometallurgist and ancient historian/archaeologist working closely together and with a successful track-record of synergistic collaboration on this topic going back over two decades. To summarise: currently we know almost nothing about the condition of Roman silver coinage between AD 194 and 260, the period leading to the presumed collapse of the currency. Through interdisciplinary study, this project will bring together metrology, fineness standards, hoard evidence, metal supply and production technology to provide a comprehensive picture of Roman silver coinage at a crucial point in the monetary history of the Roman empire.","Beneficiaries:  1) The Curators in the institutions from which the coins to be sampled are drawn, including those of project partners. The analytical information will also assist other Museum Curators in assessing new acquisitions and detecting forgeries. 2) Conservation staff in all Museums possessing Roman silver-alloy coins will have access to accurate compositional and microstructural information that will be invaluable in condition reporting and assessment of remedial conservation and storage.  3) Coin collectors in general will have information about their coins that enables a more detailed understanding of their hobby and tools with which they will be better equipped to identify imitations and forgeries. There is already considerable interest in our research from the collector community, frequently informing debate on collectors' blogs and wikis (for example the Classical numismatics discussion board).  4) The general public have a great fascination with many aspects of the past and coinage is one of these; people relate to the concept of debasement and the methods for disguising it through modern coins and the changes being wrought on these (the recent change to copper-plated steel for example), and to inflation and how changes to the currency can affect it. Such readily accessible links with past are important ways to bring the public greater awareness of the value of scholarship and our Universities.  Potential impacts:  1) The work will affect the way in which the relevant archaeological materials will be handled by the UK government's Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) and how they are interpreted for the public. Coin hoards of the period AD 193-260 are common in the UK and form a significant proportion of finds registered by the Scheme.  2) The results of the project will be used to inform museum displays of coin hoards, e.g. explaining why certain sorts of coins were hoarded together, and to what monetary changes and/or crises they were responding. Specific examples of museum displays informed by the project are Taunton Museum (the Shapwick and Yeovil hoards) and Bath Roman Baths Museum (the Beau Street hoard) (see Project Partners). 3) Fostering better understanding and an appreciation of knowledge of the historical value of archaeological objects over their commercial value are important impacts.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013037%2F1

How can scholarship be advanced by their use? How can Humanities scholars be encouraged to use them and contribute to their creation? How can museum/library documentation and conservation be shared for mutual benefit? How can management of sites and monuments (also objects in museums) benefit from 'citizen science'?  The Network will have a strong university/Humanities base and sharply focused technical goals - promoting and developing collaboratively international standards for linked open data and encouraging open access to knowledge. Digital technologies underpin Oxford's Cultural Heritage Programme established by the PI. The CoI is Vice Dean of the College of Arts in Peking University. Coincidentally they both are experts on ancient Greek art with lengthy experience of the international art/heritage community. Both universities have world-class libraries/museums, ITC expertise and extensive international collaborations. Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi has been selected for academic excellence and historical associations: founded by Indira Gandhi, it can partner with the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), also in New Delhi, and Oxford's Indira Gandhi Centre (IGC) for Sustainable Development. CH can become a major research theme there and in its China Centre. Advisory Committees can act as national hubs and foundations for future collaborations. The British Museum, British Library and Victoria and Albert Museum will be among the UK members, INTRACH and IGNCA among the Indian, CADAL and CALIS among the Chinese. The Steering Group of CHP will act as an over-arching expert group.  The research emphasis reflects each country's political structure. Since conservation and management are controlled by the State in China these themes will be highlighted in India. Since CH datasets are less well developed in India digital technologies will be highlighted in China. The Network will 'cross fertilize' through workshops; in Delhi and Beijing they will promote Digital Cultural Heritage nationally. In Oxford Indian, Chinese and UK experts will meet for three days of presentations in venues of special relevance - Said Business School (Management), Ashmolean Museum and School of the Environment (Conservation), e-Research Centre (Digital Technologies) and The Future of the Past in the PI's Wolfson College - graduate and international with Research Clusters (Digital and Asian). The Network's principal means of dissemination will be web sites where all outputs will be available to researchers and the public. The Oxford workshop will be streamed live to Delhi and Beijing and its presentations uploaded as podcasts and e-papers. The themes of Sustainable Cultural Heritage: Management and Conservation and Digital Cultural Heritage: Museums and Libraries will be of interest in developing and developed countries. The commitment to a dialogue with the east about international standards developed in the west will be of interest to national policy makers as well as computer scientists, museum curators and librarians, conservators and management specialists. The potential of data created in the east being accessible to the west and interoperable with the western can change the way scholars and the public study the past. We expect guidelines to emerge for management, conservation and technology that will have considerable impact for two reasons: the participants will be senior experts, highly regarded nationally and internationally, and they will represent key sectors of the cultural heritage and digital technology sectors.","Museums and libraries. Globally the latter have embraced digital technologies more swiftly than the former. Since Oxford and Peking universities have both they are excellent test beds for transferring benefits. The Ashmolean, British Museum and Victoria and Albert will participate. By sharing technologies with its partner museum in Mumbai the last could achieve particular impact, as could the Ashmolean with the Sackler Museum in PKU. In the library sector The Chinese Section of the Bodleian and the British Library (Dunhuang Project) will participate. Conservation and Cultural Heritage Management: Government and Public Sector Sites and monuments are often linked to national conservation and urban development programmes. Conservation labs in Oxford, London and elsewhere will participate and the potential that new digital initiatives offer for shared data will be highlighted. ConservationSpace (http://conservationspace.org/Home.html) offers open-source software applications to share documentation management globally. Since the State controls Conservation and Management the Network will focus on India, with partners such as the Indian National Trust for Cultural Heritage, the Archaeological Society of India and the Aga Khan Development Network's (AKDN) Historic Cities that can have tangible impact and attract media coverage locally, nationally and internationally. Local Communities, the Wider Public and the Media The Network proposes to explore 'citizen science' for local communities by building on the PI's pilot project with AKDN that empowers people on the ground to record their own CH with mobile devices, capture images and upload them to Oxford's e-Research Centre where they will be analysed with image recognition technologies.  To encourage wider public participation all outputs will be on web sites. Workshop events can also be streamed to universities, CH organizations and the public. Traditional press coverage will be used as well as social media networks for maximum impact, particularly among the young, who use mobile devices extensively in India and China. International Organisations (including professional/practitioner groups for International Standards in digital technologies). Libraries The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) is harmonizing museum and library conceptual models CIDOC CRM and FRBRoo (http://www.ifla.org/node/928). The use of these standards can be spread across the museum and library. In China CALIS and CADAL, flagship digital library platforms, are expected to participate in the Network, thus strengthening the potential for impact on digital policy. Digital Technology Sector and Policy-making The UK is a world leader in digital semantic web technologies; JISC has recently highlighted Discoverability of museum and collection data as a priority for digital research (http://rdtf.jiscinvolve.org/wp/ ). Showing what these technologies can offer, while actively engaging with Indian and Chinese colleagues to assess how well 'international' standards suit their data, the Network can hasten the implementation and adoption of truly international standards within the scientific communities in both countries, where Information and Communication Technologies are flourishing. Policy-makers/Governments  Given the political structures of India and China policy-making is technology-focused and described above. Commercial/Private Sector CH and dynamic ITC industries in India and China have not yet been brought together for commercial gain, nor has the great personal wealth generated by this sector been used to stimulate personal philanthropy. If CH can be seen as an inalienable human right (as under discussion for the UN) its global profile will be huge. The Network wants to see the private sector, in addition to the state, directing significant funds into Digital Cultural Heritage , and welcomes the opportunity to do this under a UK banner of AHRC.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL009579%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The birth of the British Black Arts Movement (BAM) in the early 1980s was responsible for a paradigm shift in UK art history, bringing to the fore the issues, concerns, practices and aesthetics of marginalised artists. Despite racial bias being recognised and acted upon (e.g., Equality Act 2010), racism is still a reality in British society. The systemic inequality in the representation of Black art history in Britain has come to the fore in the recent months, especially within debates around the killing of George Lloyd in the US, the Black Lives Matter protests, and the fall of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston. However, the history of the BAM and the role of cultural organisations in its development remain understudied. In preparation for the 40th anniversary of The First Black Art Convention in Wolverhampton (1982), this project aims to revisit and promote the region's unique and exceptional legacy in the development of the Black art scene, with a special focus on the role of cultural organisations in supporting artists of colour in the Midlands since the 1980s. The network will disseminate the impact of the BAM in the region, and foster a change of attitudes in the cultural sector towards a more equitable scene by identifying the challenges faced by artists of colour today and proposing recommendations to cultural organisations, policy-makers and advocacy groups.  The network activities will benefit academics in the fields of visual arts, curating and Black studies; and non-academic audience working in the cultural sector and on non-for-profit organisations supporting artists of colour. The network activities include: two workshops 1) the first invites members of the BAM to explore the role of cultural organisations in the movement in the 1980s, providing new insights; 2) the second invites practitioners of colour to identify challenges and opportunities in the field for a more diverse and inclusive approach. The workshops will be followed by a public event to open the finds and recommendations to a wider public. Both workshops and event will be recorded and disseminated via the project blog that will outlive the funded period to continue benefitting scholars and practitioners working in the fields of art history, curating, institutional practices, visual cultures, museum studies, visual arts, and Black studies. Following up on these debates, the network will produce an advocacy document with recommendations for a more equitable art programming, workforce and audience development in the cultural sector, which will be effectively disseminated to funding bodies and policy-makers (Arts Council England; Contemporary Visual Arts Network; Midlands Higher Education Culture Forum). In addition, two papers will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals to benefit other scholars in the field, disseminate new knowledge, and influence related debates. The project will be led by PI Professor Carolina Rito and Co-I Professor Paul Goodwin. The network also counts upon the participation of academics and art practitioners of colour whose work has strongly contributed to a more equitable and diverse scene and has focused on the BAM (i.e., Agency for Agency, Dr Keith Piper, Dr David Dibosa, Marlene Smith); with Midlands groups promoting inclusion led by people of colour (Maokwo, Nottingham Black Archive); and four contemporary art galleries in the Midlands with relevant experience with the BAM (the Herbert Gallery and Museum, Wolverhampton Gallery, Nottingham Contemporary and New Art Exchange.)",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV009850%2F1

The researcher support broadly falls into three categories: (1) academic mentoring (through attendance at project meetings/events and providing ongoing advice by phone and email), (2) delivering formal workshops on specific skills or resources (e.g. collecting oral histories, archaeological field survey), and (3) student volunteers working with projects as part of organised placements. A Researching Community Heritage project officer will coordinate researchers' contribution to events, training workshops, open days, student placements etc. that will taking place as part of the All Our Stories projects.

"Funding details                                                                                                              The LILA network brings together a variety of academic and non-academic participants to consider the relationship between language and the creative arts - visual arts, drama and performance, dance, music, poetry, film, and more - for learning. In formal educational contexts, and often in informal settings too, language is the chief medium for expressing, recognising and evaluating learning. Yet the arts are being increasingly employed in public support services such as health and wellbeing and migrant support, and in engagement contexts as researchers and cultural organisations seek to communicate with wider publics. The network therefore responds to a need to more fully understand the relationship between language and the arts for learning in these informal contexts.  LILA builds upon an emerging body of research into language use and language learning in which multiple creative arts practices have been part of the context, methodology, or outputs. Although some of this research has been analysed in terms of participants' learning, this has focused on how arts practice supports language/intercultural learning, and the ways in which learning takes place through the co-production of language- and arts-based practice remains under-explored. The network therefore aims to address this gap by bringing together researchers across disciplines, artists, and community and cultural organisations in order to share projects and insights. Through four one-day events in the UK (Leeds, Pudsey, London) and Catalonia, Spain (Lleida), the network will consider what different actors - research participants, audiences, organisations, researchers - learn at the intersection of language and the arts, how they learn it, and how this learning can benefit individuals, communities, and organisations.  The network is highly interdisciplinary, with invited academic contributors from education, performance practice, the humanities and clinical psychology. Our four project partners - The Art Library at Leeds Library; Love Pudsey Charity (West Yorkshire); Museu de Lleida (Catalonia); and the British Museum - will each host an event, with two final policy and practice workshops being held at University of Leeds and in central Barcelona. Each event will host an invited speaker from a community or cultural organisation, and at each event an artist collaborator - a sculptor, two musicians, and a theatre company - will lead a short creative making session. In this way the network aims to cross boundaries between countries, disciplines, sectors and practices, and to invite active participant engagement with different ways of working.  The LILA network aims to generate insights into the communication of what is otherwise unsayable: for example, the narration of unconscious knowledge, things people do not know how to talk about, do not have language for, or are prevented from speaking about. This may relate, for example, to people learning to address histories of illness or trauma, or to organisations working across sectors who are learning to communicate and enhance aspects of their practice. It is anticipated that two key benefits will arise from these insights. Firstly, they will enable different understandings of how learning might be recognised and evaluated in ways which both acknowledge the role of both the linguistic and the non-linguistic in people's engagement with and responses to the arts. This will benefit participants in community arts, and artists, art educators, and community and cultural organisations who are under pressure to demonstrate the value of working with the arts. Secondly, they will enable new understandings for the professionals and organisations working together on community arts projects of how other sectors work and how they might improve communication and collaboration. It is therefore anticipated that these insights will contribute to enhanced relationships within and between organisations.","The key anticipated benefit of the LILA network is that it will generate insights into the communication of what is otherwise unsayable: how this can take place, how it might be understood, and how it can be enhanced. These insights will be of benefit in a context where public arts programmes are increasingly being employed for public engagement purposes, particularly in relation to health, wellbeing, and social support (Reason and Rowe 2017). Users of these programmes may be limited in the extent to which they can speak and be heard, perhaps owing to mental health problems, social exclusion, trauma, or lack of access to dominant languages; and engagement with arts practice can enable the narration of things people do not know how to talk about, do not have language for, or are prevented from speaking about (Sagan 2017). Given this, the learning and change which takes place through their engagement with the arts, although often profound, may be difficult to articulate and cannot be adequately evidenced through traditional evaluation tools such as surveys and questionnaires. However, the dominant discourse of social, economic and health outcomes in public arts programmes (Johanson and Glow 2017: 98) means that such programmes are dependent on ongoing evaluation and evidence of positive impact for continued funding. This creates a problem for arts practitioners and for the community organisations who run public arts programmes, making it difficult to demonstrate evidence of the learning, growth and change artistic and aesthetic engagement can effect in ways that speak to funders' evidentiary requirements. The network will therefore benefit:  Arts practitioners and educators by informing evaluation practice through the sharing and exploration of ways to express, enhance and evidence learning through artistic and aesthetic engagement. Language educators by enhancing understanding of how engagement with arts can support language and intercultural learning, including for new arrivals and learners suffering social exclusion and trauma. Community organisations working with artists to provide services such as community healthcare providers and migrant support organisations. The network will inform understanding of the learning and change arising from arts-based public engagement programmes, how this learning might be evaluated, and how it contributes to enhanced wellbeing, community cohesion, and belonging. Museums and cultural organisations by informing engagement practice through the sharing and exploration of ways to enhance and evaluate learning for different publics. Insights into the communication of the otherwise unsayable will also benefit the different organisations involved in the provision of public arts and informal learning programmes. These organisations often come from disparate professional domains, and can face communicative challenges when collaborating across sectors (see e.g. McKay and Bradley 2016; Harvey 2018). The network will therefore benefit all of the above groups by informing intra- and inter-organisational learning, communication, relationships and wellbeing. It will do so by a) exploring the communication of different aspects of practice, including the articulation of unconscious knowledge, and b) generating insights into different sectors' ways of working.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS010963%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Cinema-goers know that the magic of the silver screen is projected from the small dark room, the projection booth, at the back of the auditorium, and 'the projectionist' is a significant figure in a range of films throughout cinema's history. Using interviews, photographs, feature films and archive research, this project investigates and documents the role of the cinema projectionist as this role passes into history and also considers some of the new potential of digital projection in public spaces. Most cinemas in Britain switched to digital projection between 2010 and 2012. Most of the multiplexes are now all digital while some repertory and art-houses maintain the capacity to project 35mm celluloid film, although fewer films are being made available in celluloid prints. This transition means that the job of projecting films has changed, with many film projectionists losing their jobs. Films are now delivered as digital files and performances are programmed by computer. The combination of mechanical and aesthetic skills that characterised the traditional cinema projectionist has become redundant. The most evident sign of these changes for the cinema-goer is the way in which the house-lights now often come on brightly immediately the film images cease. This is because the programming of the lighting into the digital performance is often done without regard for the long tradition of fading the lights up slowly to allow the audience to adjust more gently to the return to everyday reality. Projectionists used to be the most highly paid members of the cinema staff, and many have mechanical and electrical skills, as well as extensive knowledge of cinema history. The contemporary transitions in projection are the latest in a series of transformations through which the history of cinema itself can be traced. We will combine archive research and interviews with (former) projectionists to learn about what the job entails, the history of trade union involvement, significant alterations in exhibition practice and the projectionists' views of cinema and the aesthetics of the 'good performance'. This combination of methods will allow us to contribute to the understanding and history of cinema as both industry and artform. The interviews, which will be mainly organised on a regional basis, will allow us both to document a passing analogue/ mechanical trade and also contribute to the debates about the future of cinema as it becomes digital. Our pilot study has taught us that although projectionists work anti-social hours, they often know each other within a locality and between them can provide a history of cinema exhibition in the area. This oral history of the more recent period will be put in historical perspective through research in trade union archives and trade papers to narrate a history of the figure of the projectionist. For example, after WWI this was seen as a job particularly suitable for facially disfigured veterans, while during both World Wars, the job was performed by women ('projectionettes').  The research into the contemporary and historical figure of the projectionist within a British context will be complemented by two minor, more international themes, the representation of the projectionist in the movies - which is how most people know about projection - which will be researched as a Phd, and the investigation of 'The New Projection', the emergent uses of digital projection as an artistic practice, conducted by the scholar and artist, Dr Michael Pigott. Here, our interest lies as much in the new material practices of digital curation as in the selected case studies of projected image-work. Through these different aspects of the project, we hope to demonstrate the way in which the attention to projection and the figure of the projectionist can illuminate both histories and theories of the digital future of cinema and projection-based work.","This project seeks to intervene in public discourses about the 'digital revolution' through a specific historical enquiry which examines the effect of the transition to digital in one industry/ artform that is dependent on the projection of light. As its material is the mass popular art form of the C20th, and its topic the transformation of both the medium and everyday working lives, it has rich potential for several types of impact and wider public engagement. WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH? We will focus on four categories of potential beneficiaries:  1.The national public, conceptualised as both 'digital natives' - those to whom non-digital media delivery is almost inconceivable - and the digitally dispossessed - those, like projectionists and many other, often older workers, who have lost employment through digital transformations. In this sense the project will address a prevalent source of inter-generational anxiety and dissatisfaction, and will foster public sphere engagement with notions of technology and change that impact on everyday lives. 2. The local communities where the interviews will be conducted, and particularly those in Birmingham who will benefit directly from the project's collaboration with the Flatpack Festival. 3.The theatrical cinema industry, including those currently and previously employed as projectionists. Our advisory board will represent two important cinema heritage organisations - the Cinema Theatre Association and the Projected Picture Trust - which have substantial numbers of current and retired projectionists among their membership. As well as involving both societies by enlisting their help to solicit interview participants, we will report in their quarterly newsletters.  4. Curators and contemporary arts policy-makers, particularly those involved in commissioning and curating moving image and projection based work. This will be effected through direct collaboration with the curators of the Flatpack Festival, more widely through Pigott's engagement with galleries while conducting research, and finally through a workshop held at the University of Warwick. HOW MIGHT THEY BENEFIT? We will develop a number of outputs, events and on-going projects including:  -exhibition events in collaboration with project partner, Birmingham based Flatpack Festival, a pioneering organisation that runs an internationally recognized annual festival of film and audiovisual installations. The events will draw upon our primary research to produce interactive experiences and commissioned artworks engaging with the materials, technologies, histories, and meanings of 'projection'.  -Exhibition with project partner Richard Nicholson which will document and celebrate 35 mm projection. (See partner letter) This exhibition will include (with permission), selections from the projectionist interviews.  -Online Virtual Projection Booth which would be freely accessible via a web-browser. The user will be able to discover the functionalities of various bits of equipment, as well as other details about the workspace of the projectionist, and to contribute to a dialogue about the processes of projection, and the transition from an analogue to digital mode, through a comments section. -Curating the Projected Image workshop held at the University of Warwick. This will bring together curators and academics to reflect upon the outcomes of the project. IMPACT MEASUREMENT The impact of these engagement initiatives will be measured using a variety of methods, such as: exit polls, questionnaires and blog-scraping of comments about the Flatpack events; an interactive comments system for the Virtual Projection Booth allowing the public to record their own views and to demonstrate what they have learned and how their understanding has changed. In some cases (Flatpack and the Virtual Projection Booth) the engagement generated will have the potential to feed back into the project, and to contribute to reports/outputs.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL008033%2F1

Through education enriched by research, innovation, and engagement with business and the professions, we aim to transform lives and economies. As an anchor institution, the university plays an important role in the development of the Tees Valley. Aligned to regional and national needs, we have invested (and are continuing to invest) in a suite of industry and community engaged facilities. As a University Alliance member, we work collaboratively at an institutional level across the UK. Over the next five years, engagement will be placed at the heart of our research strategy as part of our overarching corporate social responsibility framework, the Teesside University Charter for Social Impact, which is embedded as part of the corporate strategy. The Charter framework is based on the University being socially responsible and acting as a good citizen; leading by example as an ethical business; ensuring that activities are relevant, informed, accessible and inclusive; and acting where the University's expertise, facilities, people, and position can deliver positive social and/or economic impact.  Arts and Humanities research at Teesside University is located primarily within the Centre for Culture and Creativity (CCC). Research includes art, animation and games design, archaeology, business studies, creative writing, cultural geography, curation, dance, design, literature, history, media studies and performing arts. Working in partnership with regional, national, and international organisations and charities (Tate Plus, National Gallery Research Network, Creative Fuse North East), CCC seeks to enrich cultural understanding, increase cultural engagement, stimulate public debate, advance creative and applied practice, and drive positive social change.  This IAA will be used to develop and expand our areas of impact excellence, focusing on three themes: Reimagining the Creative Industries; Raising the Profile of Hidden Histories and Voices; and Reconnecting with the Built and Natural Environments. IAA funding will be used to support sustained and immersive partnership working with a diverse range of sectors and geographies through innovative and imaginative forms of engagement. Building on partnerships demonstrated in the Creative Fuse NE project and through our doctoral training and University Alliance membership, funds will support cross-sector engagement to ensure sustainable and substantial impact work. We will extend the reach of our work in terms of both geography and audience, building on the strong connections within our region. We will engage more deeply with hard-to-reach and marginalised communities, ensuring sustainable legacies and building trust by demonstrating the significant value of arts and humanities research to a range of different sectors, stakeholders, and community groups.

"Funding details                                                                                                              This project seeks to understand the value located in a range of arts/cultural activities to refugees, a group new to British cultural life who are often marginalised from 'mainstream' cultural activities, but who are simultaneously expected to adopt a hegemonic national identity of Britishness and henceforward espouse British cultural values. Refugees are a group who typically have experienced forced migration, oftentimes related specifically to their own - often fiercely defended - cultural activities and values in their country of origin. This migratory biography makes for a complex, rich contribution to how we think about the value of arts and culture, and cultural expression, in the UK today. We will investigate the standpoint of refugees on British cultural values, benefitting from their 'outsider within' perspective. British cultural values are not unitary, nor are they precisely definable, they are shaped and refined by participation and engagement. We will seek to identify the components of cultural value embedded in a set of typically British arts and cultural pursuits, based in and around the city of Brighton. We will break down the components to be identified using a range of methods that focus on the discrete senses, and on the particular forms of embodiment that such activities claim. We want to examine carefully what constitutes the experience of involvement in the arts and cultural sphere, so we will also be collecting information on the cognitions and emotions that are attached to such experiences.  Refugees constitute a unique case: migrants pay acute attention to the acculturation of British values. This attention can be a protective mechanism, a philosophical choice, an attempt to move away from a traumatized past or culture of origin, an imposed set of norms, or a way of making their enforced dislocation intelligible. Refugees are legally required to learn British cultural values in order to be 'awarded' citizenship, via the Home Office instrument, the 'Life in the UK' Test (which will be interrogated in group discussion). Whatever the reason, refugees have an acute sensitivity and prescient awareness of 'what makes us British'. Yet, often their access to the cultural industries can be severely restricted, due to explicit factors such as economic barriers, and due to implicit factors such as the perceived 'Whiteness' of some art/cultural pursuits (eg. premier league football, and the opera - two performances that will form part of our programme). This project will take the form of a 16 week course, called 'What is British Culture', offered to 12 women refugees. Through a range of arts and cultural activities, we will assess refugee's embodied experience of participation and reflection, gathering sensory information through creative expression. In order to gather robust data, the course is quite long and demanding; however we have found in previous projects that refugee participants appreciate such commitments as they enable a strong group identity to form, which can continue informally after the planned meetings finish, providing a sustainable resource. As researchers we have our own cultural values: our model is taken from feminist praxis. Feminist epistemologies focus on the way ""in which gender does and ought to influence our conceptions of knowledge, the knowing subject, and practices of inquiry and justification"" (Anderson 2004). At the core of feminist epistemology is the concept of the situated knower, who produces situated knowledge. Donna Haraway (1998) famously argued that most knowledge, in particular academic knowledge is always ""produced by positioned actors working in/between all kinds of locations"". Collaborative learning, respect for social difference, creating an environment of mutual support, listening and consideration for others, these characteristics are all markers of the feminist classroom, cultural values which we hope to emulate in the process of the research.","The concepts of Britishness and British values are repeatedly invoked by UK politicians across the political spectrum, particularly in relation to rapid socio-cultural change connected to immigration. Community cohesion, national identity, citizenship education and the perceived need to promote belonging and shared values are high on the political agenda. The potential importance of this research to these debates, to policy makers, government agencies and politicians is therefore very great. This is indicated by our partnerships with Demos, the Refugee Council and Refugee Action. They will support the widest possible dissemination of the research at national level to enhance its impact on public policy. The Advisory Board (AB) will provide an overview and context for the project, from planning to completion.Members of the AB constitute existing members of SCCS, drawn from Health, Social Science, Arts and Humanities disciplines at the Universities of Sussex and Brighton, as well as representatives from partner organisations who will take back to their organisations our iterative findings, and a 'student rep' - one of the women. A key role of the AB will be sharing knowledge and best practice, and disseminating aspects of the project to their own communities of interest and networks. All partners are invited to the closing SCCS/Demos conference.  Our local partners, both public sector and private (Museum, Libraries, Albion Football Club, Glyndebourne etc) see this project as an important means of increasing the effectiveness of their service and making it more accessible and appropriate to a broader community. This impact will be generated through their learning from participants during the project and from the findings of the research. The project will therefore be shaping professional practice in a wide range of cultural and organisational settings. The resulting enhancement to services will benefit the wider public, including marginalised groups.  Perhaps our most immediate impact will be the personal impact on the participants themselves. We hope to enhance quality of life and improve mental health among a group who statistically manage very high levels of stress, depression and anxiety (Refugee Council 2007). Using arts and culture to widen experience we hope to improve both their, and our, understanding of difference and place in the world. Despite refugees in some ways constituting a unique case, the empirical material gathered has transferable viability. Does the way a migrant might acculturate values through participation in the arts have implication for how 'native' audiences also accumulate values? We hypothesize that it does, but that the outsider/stranger perspective of the migrant may make such processes more visible or conscious. The research will throw up a number of questions that we would like to push forward for future investigation. Other opportunities for impact will be provided by a guide for those working with refugees on how to design effective and meaningful arts-based projects; a project website hosted by SCCS; a touring exhibition installed in the foyers of Brighton Library, the Brighton Unitarian Church (Munt is a member), the Friends Adult Education Centre (Morrice is a Trustee) and Sussex University Meeting House. The exhibitions will increase public awareness of difference and diversity, impacting on tolerance and social cohesion.  Finally, we intend to address impact in terms of capacity building: career development for Co-I 1 will be integrated into the bid in the form of an application for promotion to Reader if we are successful. Bennett and Aristopoulou will apply for Postdoctoral Fellowships in the subsequent bid. Bennett will be trained in administering cognitive measures and assessment. We anticipate that a range of interested partners will have augmented their skills and expertise by the close of the project, which will in itself contribute to developing impact and engagement.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL005409%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              We will build an international partnership of experts in natural resource management, fauna, flora, anthropology, sociology, language documentation & community archiving to examine the relationship between Language & Nature in Southern & Eastern Arabia, an area with significant, rapidly depleting biocultural diversity, but one for which biocultural diversity is little recognised (cf. http://www.unep.org/pdf/Cultural_Spiritual_thebible.pdf). We will focus initially on areas for which most language data is available to the team: Yemen, Dhofar, Jiddat al-Harasis & Musandam (Oman), and exploit the case study to create an interdisciplinary methodology applicable in other areas where both local languages and the environment are threatened. The work is timely because both local languages and ecosystems of the region are at imminent risk, and because of the increasingly fragile political situation in the Middle East. We will assess quantity & quality of our available language & ecosystem data and identify data gaps for future work, to be conducted as far as possible by local community members & academics, & begin comparative investigations further within SE Arabia.    Documentation of the Modern South Arabian languages (MSAL) & Kumzari shows that local language and nature enjoy a tight symbiotic relationship. Our earlier work suggests the domains of use in these languages which are disappearing the fastest are those closely bound to the environment and related facets of the economy. Conversely, linguistic knowledge has successfully been used to revive endangered aspects of the ecosystem: the Harasis' indigenous knowledge of the oryx was used to revive the endangered population in Oman. In our area, orientation & direction terms are geocentric, based on topographic terms differing according to both language variety & region. Quantification terms are frequently nature-based: time is described by sun position, verbs of movement differ by time of day, & expressions of animal herd sizes depend on object of description. Figurative language is closely related to nature: in Mehri (MSAL), a tall man with a shock of hair may be described as xaheh simar 'he looks like a simar [tree]'. A brave man may have the epithet KayZar 'leopard'. Kumzari personal name derivations reflect the natural environment, as in: Has Qabobo 'Hassan tuna.fish.species'. Poetry is especially rich in nature-figurative language: the Shahri (MSAL) line hEz min garb / Sarif d-irHasEn 'wind from west, stones he licks' refers to a man from the west, so poor he has to lick stones, who takes another man's wife; Mehri hZawr 'grue [colour]' has the poetic sense 'sea'. Terms are often introduced by semantic extension: Kalifot 'bark [tree]' in Mehri & Bathari (MSAL) has the secondary sense 'spoon'. Its original sense & knowledge that bark was once used as an eating tool is lost on many younger speakers, who are increasingly sedentary and no longer enjoy the close human-nature relationship of their forebears.    Scholars will meet through annual workshops, video conferences, Skype & email. Training in research methods & analysis will be shared through academic visits between Leeds & Qatar participants. Collaboration has already been established with several team members: MOOC on Language & Nature at Leeds (2015, Lovett PI), Documentation & Ethnolinguistic Analysis of Modern South Arabian (2013-2016, Watson PI), Endangered Languages workshops Leeds & SOAS (2014, 2015, Seyfeddinipur, Watson), Seasonal navigation & time telling in the Arab Gulf (Varisco PI), interdisciplinary workshops at QU (2015, 2016, Al-Ghanim PI). Representatives of local mobile social groups provide insider perspectives on local languages & ecosystems in their regions. This is the first time all members come together to investigate the complex relationship of Language & Nature in SE Arabia, and the first time such an interdisciplinary team collaborate to address the complex relationship of Language & Nature.","The project has significant potential cultural & societal impact, and directly involves language community members. It will have the following impacts on language communities of Southern & Eastern Arabia.    Language & ecosystem revitalisation  The project aims to promote language & ecosystem revitalisation by encouraging speakers to speak about their natural environment in their local languages. The project hopes to encourage speakers to carry out their own research within their communities and beyond, make presentations, produce YouTube documentaries, and publish their results. The aim is to raise the profile and status of MSAL, Kumzari and Southern & Eastern Arabic dialects and the local environments amongst speakers themselves and also in the wider Arab community.   Documentation of threatened & historical culture & environment  Spotlighting the significance of traditional knowledge & stewardship of the environment will have an impact on formal & non-formal education opportunities to pass down to future generations. The related Documentation of Modern South Arabian project (Watson PI) through recording of culture- & environment-specific texts has provided a large bank of audio, audio-visual & photographic data relating to threatened & extinct ecosystem elements & practices involving nature: http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/homepage/462/modern_south_arabian_languages. This project has revived interest in the languages & cultures of the region among the wider community, particularly among younger speakers. Younger community members are recording their elderly relatives and are gaining insights into the human-nature relationship in the pre-motorised past. This initiative, which translated into a growing pride in the skills & resilience of earlier generations, and an increasing interest in learning about the past, will be extended to our wider region in the project Language & Nature. Language revitalisation through script  Once lost, a purely oral language can never be replaced. The Documentation of Modern South Arabian developed a script for MSAL based on Arabic, encouraging community members to communicate digitally in the languages using Arabic characters, and to transcribe collected sound files. Language & Nature will extend use of this script, encouraging transcription of texts on nature, to provide written versions of audio & audio-visual texts for community members & the research community.  Dissemination with community members  Language & Nature will produce joint presentations & written & digital outputs with community members. This will raise the value of the project for audiences & local participants. Members of Documentation of Modern South Arabian delivered over 20 presentations to institutions, local schools in Oman & the UK, & various public groups, most of which were co-presented with community members, including lectures & workshops in Europe, UK & the Gulf.    Community training Community archive training through Yarn (Popple, Leeds) will be available to local community members. An Arabic version of the instruction films will be reversioned at Leeds: https://vimeo.com/15631312. This will provide tools to record aspects of language & nature & develop shared ownership of the project. Local participants in Documentation of MSAL became increasingly involved in recording & archiving audio, audio-visual & photographic material, becoming advocates of preserving the languages. We hope that Language & Nature will also increase the communities' advocacy of the environment. Training in community archiving within the Language & Nature project will heighten local sensitivity about the link between endangered languages & endangered ecosystems. Capacity building workshops will provide local communities with the tools and confidence to advocate access to their own language instruction in formal schooling, to elaborate initiatives to preserve their languages, & to promote conservation in the wider society.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP009050%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              As the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has made increasingly clear, outbreaks of infectious diseases represent a veritable 'stress test' for a country's underlying socio-economic and political structures. This includes its ability to harness technologies and infrastructures of communication to overcome such public health crises, for example by implementing population surveillance measures, communicating with broader publics, coordinating epidemic responses or devising strategies of preparedness against future outbreaks (Budd et al. 2020). As medical and social phenomena, epidemics tend to be highly mediatized events, although the limits and local inflections of that mediatization are yet to be subjected to sustained critical attention in both historical and contemporary settings. Furthermore, they provide significant opportunities to reflect on the ways in which technology and society co-constitute each other. By becoming testing grounds for various technologies of epidemic management, epidemics accelerate innovation, adaptation and change, but also bring to the fore inequalities of access, legal, ethical and privacy dilemmas, questions of public trust, effective communication of science and (mis)information overload. The recent resurgence of the term 'infodemic' is a stark reminder that epidemics are not only corporeal experiences, but also events of intense meaning making (Bashford and Hooker 2001), in the course of which social actors scramble to cope with myriad anxieties and uncertainties. Our concern in this project is to historicize contemporary digital transformations in the field of public health, but also to advance academic and public conversations about the actual meaning of the 'Digital Age,' both as a heuristic device and lived reality. By probing the interconnected development of medicine, media and technology, we hope to draw attention to a neglected field of historical and cultural inquiry and answer a question of significant contemporary relevance: How digital is the Digital Age? A long-term, trans-regional and trans-disciplinary perspective on the technological aspects of epidemic management can help us to understand how media and technology shape the making and communication of knowledge about public health, but also to probe the extent to which electronic dematerialization has been relevant to managing such outbreaks in the first place. Bridging the past and present of digital technologies, the project's thematic scope overlaps with both strands of the CHANSE call, 'Cultural transformations in the digital age?' and 'Digitalisation and social transformation'. In particular, we aim to understand contemporary digital transformations in the field of public health by locating them within a longer, culturally specific history of innovation and social change. We pay attention to the social inequalities, exclusions and ethical dilemmas that have framed technology use in public health since the mid-20th century as well as the intersections between political power, the mediatization of epidemics and the public communication of science. The project aims to intervene in current debates about the Digital Age by conceptualizing media and technologies of communication both as objects of historical and cultural inquiry and instruments of learning about past epidemics. Drawing on the repertoire of the humanities and the performing arts, it makes use of neglected historical archives and technologies old and new to develop educational tools that bring historical awareness to contemporary challenges around technology, media and public health, and promote media literacy more generally.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX005593%2F1

It will open up, generate and re-present the archive of South Asian Britain for public audiences, community groups and academics. By exposing the little-known impact and legacies of South Asians in Britain, the project will make key interventions into historical, cultural and literary inquiry, revealing the complex, textured production of Britain's cultural-political identities. Centrally, the project will explore how South Asian networks and connections across the UK have been and can be documented, remembered and narrated, and will link archival resources, oral histories and research findings in a publicly accessible database. In partnership with the British Library, it will create a free interactive research resource with interconnected entries on people, organisations, events and locations to visualise the embedded presence of South Asians in the UK. Among others, a key focus will be on underrepresented communities such as workers (e.g. seamen, pedlars, domestic workers, textile workers & today's 'key workers') and the literary and more broadly creative arts (e.g. writers, editors & theatre practitioners) to trace networks and their societal and cultural impact.  The project extends the work of previous AHRC funded projects 'Making Britain: Visions of Home and Abroad (1870-1950)' and 'Beyond the Frame: Indian-British Connections', led by Susheila Nasta (OU/QMUL), which laid important foundations to ongoing research in this field. Central to the original projects was a database launched in 2010. Given technological innovations, and increased archival digitisation efforts, this project will significantly expand the research to create a newly conceived digital resource that will bring this multi-faceted history to life. Absorbing the old database, it will substantially rework and expand its content, extending it back to 1830 and up to the present, incorporating new archival findings as well as new oral history interviews with the generation who lived through decolonisation and partition. New digital humanities tools and techniques will be used to draw out previously unrecorded networks among South Asians in Britain, connecting them to other racialised minorities and the white majority. The c.750 planned entries will be complemented by sound files, images and digitised archival materials, as well as learning resources for schoolchildren, educators and adult learners. The design and functionality of this database will be generated in collaboration with the public through user experience workshops. The project is positioned at the intersection of the digital humanities, history and literary studies. By focusing on networks (among individuals, across groups and geographical space) and by taking a long historical perspective, it will intervene in and extend current debates about migration, diaspora and belonging. By highlighting the complexities of Britain's lesser-known long intersecting migration histories, it will complicate knowledge of South Asian settlement in Britain. In its excavation and analysis of archival material and oral histories, the project will extend scholarship that seeks to develop a decolonial archival praxis and contribute to conversations about decolonising the arts, heritage and culture sectors. In collaboration with the British Library, it will provide key tools for teachers and schoolchildren, as well as members of the public, to understand and explore British history and contemporary culture as inclusive of and shaped by its South Asian inhabitants, citizens and communities. Crucially, the project will deepen and complicate contemporary public debates on belonging and home, and help to remake ideas of Britain and Britishness.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX001520%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Being able to link - to go from one document to another - is one of the great facilitating features of the World Wide Web. It is how you are able to find out more about or get a different perspective on something that interests you at the click of a mouse. But how are these linkages enabled? Since 2011 Pelagios (http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/) has been developing the means of linking independently created and hosted online resources together via their common references to place. This Linked Open Data approach essentially means: (i) having your document (whether that is a text, image, map or database, etc.) openly online; (ii) annotating ('tagging') all place references in the metadata that underlies your online document; and (iii) aligning those references to a Web-based gazetteer service that provides a unique global identifier (i.e. a unique code number) for individual places in the world. These annotations collectively form a Web-based network connecting documents to places and thus to one another. By these means, Pelagios has been playing a crucial role in creating a World Wide Web of antiquity, whereby scholars, students, cultural heritage providers or general enthusiasts can not only make their resources more discoverable and usable, but also enable others to find out about the cities of antiquity and explore the rich interconnections between them.  Pelagios 4 builds on this essential infrastructural work to reflect on 5 key moments in the story of the history of geographic representation. In the pre-modern European and Mediterranean world (i.e. before the discovery of the Americas), geographic space was represented in a variety of ways - computational measurements of early Greek and Latin literature; accounts of sea voyages in the Mediterranean and Black Sea; itineraries of land routes in the Late Roman Empire; seafaring maps of coastlines from mediaeval Europe; and mediaeval pilgrimage literature. This project focuses on these sources and their contexts in order to identify and explore the many different ways in which the world was viewed and understood, before the development of standardizing global cartographic conventions (such as the Mercator projection) that followed the European discovery of the Americas in 1492. Taken together, these sources provide invaluable testimony to lost ways of thinking about the world that may serve to challenge our standardized image, which, if anything, has become even more dominant in the age of Google Maps and Google Earth. Yet, previously the study of Early Geospatial Documents has suffered from the difficulty of accessing the sources (particularly old maps) and finding information about places buried deep in lengthy texts. Due to digitization efforts, it is now possible to access these different kinds of information; and, thanks to Pelagios, these materials can now be easily linked together and aggregated, enabling texts to be read against other types of source (maps, archaeological data, etc.) and vice versa. Using the enriched context that Pelagios's Linked Open Data provides to these Early Geospatial Documents, Pelagios 4 will work with expert scholars to bring out the distinctive contribution of each type of document to the development of geospatial knowledge production from antiquity through to the mediaeval period. In particular we will be keen to address the continuities and discontinuities in conceptions of geographic space, the comparison of these ancient witnesses to the archaeological record, and the difference between textual and pictorial representation of space.","To date, Pelagios has shown itself to be interesting to a variety of parties beyond academia: - Content sharers: Pelagios partners a number of institutions beyond Higher Education, including the British Museum, the British Library, The International Association for Classical Archaeology (AIAC) and the American Numismatic Society. - News organizations: Pelagios has been featured in a variety of online news outlets including The Guardian, Russia Today and El Pais (Uruguay). - Online portals: The online Spanish language classics portal Portal Clásico described the Pelagios interface as ""the closest thing we've ever experienced to going back in time and knowing the landscape as it was in Antiquity"" (http://portalclasico.com/proyectos-pelagios-el-mapa-virtual-del-imperio-romano). - The Pelagios Team has provided consultation on Linked Open Data approaches to cultural heritage for a variety of organizations including the German Archaeological Institute, the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, the Getty Conservation Institute, the World Monuments Fund, the Linked Ancient World Data Institute, English Heritage, the British Library, the British Museum, Ordnance Survey, and Wikidata. - Private individuals: There have been multiple expressions of interest from the general public worldwide, either to join our network (http://vici.org/) or to volunteer to help build our annotations. The reasons for this interest are varied: - Value Addition: Resource Providers are able to enrich and contextualise their content more easily. - Discovery: Resource providers are more likely to be found due to increased number of incoming links. - Serendipity: users are more likely to encounter related content by chance, without having originally sought it. - The Pleasure principle: many users (and the Pelagios team) enjoy playing with Pelagios data and finding new and unexpected patterns within it. - Cultural connections: The wide geographic breadth, visual appeal, and emphasis on the historic transience of borders, along with a limited emphasis English text, make Pelagios relevant to people from a very wide (and increasing) range of countries, and encourage them to reconsider the world without contemporary borders. Pelagios 4 will continue to work with these partners in enabling teachers, students, policy makers, memory institutions and general enthusiasts to benefit more directly from our digital data and tools and to explore the ancient and pre-modern worlds in new and exciting ways. These benefits operate on multiple levels. The ability to spatially locate people, places and events is extremely important for the comprehension of almost any ideas about historical development: Pelagios 4 will facilitate this process by allowing non-specialist or technical users (other researchers, teachers, students or the general enthusiast) to see how individual accounts refer to specific places, in contrast to the high level synthetic overviews typically found in secondary literature, whether written or drawn for a scholarly or lay audience. At a deeper level the graph of connections between such sources will allow users to discover contextualizing related material. Because Linked Open Data is Web based, such resources are instantly accessible, reducing the barriers to entry which currently impede public engagement. This will be of significant benefit to Content Providers hosting EGDs who should not only see a rise in traffic but, by tracing its source, will be able to show directly its value within academic research. Content providers hosting data related to the places referred to in EGDs should also see increased use as users 'explore' the data. Policy makers, such as JISC, will benefit from several concrete examples of how Linked Open Data can be used to support the Arts and Humanities. Public agencies like Ordnance Survey will benefit from real use cases of spatial indexing and querying.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM002225%2F1

Organized in collaboration with the Pan-Afrikan Reparations Coalition in Europe (UK) and the Association Panafricaine pour une réparation globale de l'esclavage (Benin), these meetings led to the creation of the International Network of Scholars and Activists for Afrikan Reparations (INOSAAR). We concentrated on creating a more holistic understanding of the meaning of reparation and reparative justice from African community perspectives. This included finding creative ways of healing the longstanding legacies of African enslavement, including cultural loss and environmental degradation, and highlighting the lack of research into models of reparation that engage with cultural, spiritual and environmental forms of repair. Existing models tend to favour top-down, state-led approaches that rely on international law courts and monetary repayment; whereas we identified the equal importance of grassroots, community-led initiatives that are focused on repairing the loss of African culture and spirituality, and the links between cultural repair and the environment. These two interconnected areas form the basis for this project. The first relates to the processes by which the descendants of those who were forcibly displaced from Africa are able to re-establish their cultural and spiritual links to the African continent; a process known as 'rematriation'. The second relates the ways in which struggles for reparative justice are underpinned by the need for 'planet repairs' and the role that African culture and knowledge can play in contributing to ecological and reparative social movements more broadly.  In response, we identified a three-phase (P) project with specific aims and objectives: P1. To create a high-quality video-documentary in Benin on cultural loss and the reconnection of African descendants to the continent with unprecedented access to Beninese cultural and spiritual sites; P2. To expand African youth participation in reparations activism through a training workshop in Ghana focused on planet and cultural repair, including professional training in communications and video-making;  P3. To develop links to traditional African leaders in Ghana (building from our existing connections in Benin) through a workshop looking at rematriation and planet repair, and the importance of policymaking that facilitates these processes. Each phase aims to raise awareness and deepen our understanding of reparation as linked to cultural, spiritual and planet repair, while contributing to the International Social Movement for Afrikan Reparations (ISMAR). Working closely with African community and activist groups in Ghana, Benin and the UK, while using the experience of our existing network, this funding will enable us and our partners to expand the benefits of our network to larger numbers of interested communities. The video-documentary will promote the importance of cultural and spiritual rematriation, showing this to be an integral part of achieving reparation for African and African descended communities. The youth workshop will provide training in video-making and communication skills to build links and solidarity with the ISMAR and global climate change movements, such as Extinction Rebellion. The workshop with the Ghanaian paramount chiefs will act as a pilot to feed into public policy on African rematriation and planet repair through traditional leadership structures. Together, these activities will make a positive contribution to the UNIDPAD by promoting the importance of African heritage and culture to global movements for reparative and environmental justice.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV006681%2F1

The enduring idea that this invention was a sole point of revolution, in which the technology of printing with movable type was brought into the world fully-fledged by Johannes Gutenberg in 1452, is no longer accepted. Instead, the generation between c. 1440 and c. 1470 must be conceived as a period of ongoing technological experimentation across and between reprographic media. A whole range of such media flourished in that generation: books printed from carved wooden blocks (blockbooks); texts and images printed on single leaves from wooden blocks (woodcuts) or engraved plates (metalcuts), books and documents printed with movable type (incunabula), and hybrids of all of these. Furthermore, there was almost certainly more than one different method of printing with movable type in existence. These individual printing crafts have been treated hitherto as discrete entities. Hence it has been supposed that the relationship between them, and thus between their creators, was competitive. Yet how these technologies intersected in this seminal period is currently a matter of conjecture, not knowledge.  This innovative project will draw together expertise from across what are currently considered to be separate disciplines - the study of leaves printed from woodblocks and metal-cuts, the study of blockbooks, and the study of printing with moveable type - to produce an holistic analysis of reprographic technology. Creating a synergy of both collections and expertise in Manchester, Mainz and Erlangen, it will develop and deploy cutting-edge digital analysis techniques for the first time to interrogate the entirety of the material output from this period. The objectives of the project will be twofold. First, to analyse digitally every printed edition produced with moveable type between 1440 and 1470, using pattern recognition approaches to be developed at Erlangen. In combination with experiments in historical printing, this will allow us to identify and define how many different technologies were actually at play, and by whom, when and where they were invented and developed. Second, to survey systematically the paper stocks used by the producers of single-leaf woodcuts and metalcuts, blockbooks and incunabula in the same period. This material investigation will allow us to determine whether these different technologies were being employed by separate workshops competitively, or, as we hypothesize, in the same workshops, to achieve different medial ends: a radically different picture of the economic history of early print culture.  Using an innovative combination of digital, photographic, and bibliographical methods, this project will transform our understanding of the genesis of the most important technological innovation of its age.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW010615%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The atmosphere of fear and suspicion that pervaded the Cold War period is emerging again today. The combination of uncertain planetary survival and existential threat (nuclear war then, climate catastrophe now), ideological enmity (communism then, 'radical' Islam now), Great Power rivalry (the US and USSR then, the US and China and Russia now), the perceived need to defend the capitalist economy (then and now), and the suppression of plural forms of cultural and economic life by polarities of various kinds, have become features of our present circumstances.  Almost everything in the history of contemporary international law is explained with reference to the Cold War. The commencement of the Cold War, its duration and its end are all regularly invoked as constitutive moments in the development of international law. Contemporary accounts almost invariably assert that the Cold War was an interruption of some kind to the 'normal' liberal-capitalist order of the world, and its corollary regulative frame. Key normative and institutional projects of the post-war era are described as being 'casualties' of 'the political struggle between the two blocs'. In essence, this consensus presents the Cold War as a period of suspension or aberration in the progress toward the establishment of a liberal international order after the end of Empire.  The motivating concern of this project is that treating the Cold War as a forty-year aberration in the establishment of the liberal international legal order reinforces a disciplinary blindness toward the constitutive role the Cold War played in the very formation of international law and institutions, and toward the role international law played in making the Cold War real. This blindness exemplifies and manifests the disciplinary bias toward understanding international law as 'innocent', never implicated in violence, ideological conflict and suffering, but only in their resolution. Such restricted accounts impede the kinds of understandings of those relations which are necessary help to illuminate the causes of conflict, suffering and state 'failure' in the present day. If we are re-living, or are about to re-live, the Cold War in different terms, and if we wish to reinvigorate international law as a way of engaging normatively with global circumstances, then developing multi-perspectival and rigorous understandings of international law's relation to the Cold War is essential.  This project aims to generate and give voice to diverse perspectives on histories of the relationship between the Cold War and international law, and their legacies for law and policy. It aims both to address a significant gap in current understandings, and to strengthen modes of scholarly engagement that actively counteract the polarisation of political perspectives in the present moment. The network will join scholars from international law, history, film, Cold War studies, international relations and other disciplines in the humanities, from research institutions in the UK, Europe, North America, Australia, India, South Africa, Indonesia and several former Eastern Bloc countries, and develop diverse and rigorous perspectives on international law and the Cold War. These accounts will push against standard periodisations, question common assumptions about the progress and completion of the War, and put forward innovative accounts of its relationship to international legal development. Bridging the fields of scholarship and policy, the network will be uniquely placed to develop a shared understanding of how the proliferating regulatory domains of international law and institutions may meet the challenges of the future. The project will impact on future research agendas in many substantive areas of international law, from armed conflict to development, from trade to migration, and from human rights to international environmental law.","The proposed research network aims to provide useful insights for legal advisors and practictioners, policy makers, non-governmental organisations, civil society movements and individuals in a wide variety of settings, both national and international. An improved understanding of the historic role played by international law and legal institutions through the period of the cold war, and of the way in which the cold war shaped contemporary international law is important for all of these actors. The re-emergence in recent years of an atmosphere of fear and suspicion around questions of planetary survival (nuclear holocaust then and climate change now), ideological enmity (communism then, 'fundamentalism' now), and Great Power rivalry (formerly the US and USSR, now the US, Russia and China) makes all the more urgent a clear understanding of how international legal structures and initiatives may, from experience, either dampen or exacerbate those threats. The proposed research has clear policy implications. By examining the mutual constitution of the cold war and international law, the network will contribute to the revision of a reified account of power politics that underpins much international legal activity to this day. In developing an understanding of the way in which international legal interventions (relating for example to the regulation of the use of force, the control of weaponry, the promotion of human rights or humanitarian law) may operate recursively - to frame as well as be framed by - the social, political and economic order in which they are located, will invigorate a much more profound reflection upon the utility and effectiveness of various contemporary initiatives. The network, in that sense, will provide policy makers with evidence of the complex interplay between international law and the social, economic, political relations that underpin ideological competition, providing examples of the way in which legal initiatives may offer alternative means by which tensions and conflict may be addressed. The published research will provide policy makers, legal advisors and activists with a series of detailed case studies of particular fields of international law and legal initiatives and institutions, providing a much more complex account of their emergence and more nuanced account of their social, economic or cultural 'effects'. Potential beneficiaries include, in the UK, the Foreign Office, the Department of International Development as well as a range of NGOs such as Amnesty International and Chatham House. Beyond the UK, it includes the foreign ministries of other States, and UN and regional agencies dealing with questions of trade, human rights. Network investigators have a wide range of contacts with governmental and non-governmental agencies with whom they intend to communicate research network results for further discussion. For purposes of this project network investigators have already established contacts with the Georgian Ministry of Defence which has agreed to convene a workshop in Tbilisi, bringing together scholars, policy makers and legal advisors from across the former Soviet Union and parallel initiatives within Australia, the UK and elsewhere are envisaged.  Further, the network will be reaching out to a public audience through the hosting of a seminar/film series in London hosted at the LSE and SOAS which will provide an opportunity not merely to broaden access to the academic discussion, but deepen public understanding of international law and its role in shaping international order.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP002684%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Science and technology are increasingly important to society. At the same time, controversial research (such as around stem cells and climate change science) feature in fierce public and policy debates. Many people have strong feelings over what kinds of research should be undertaken, and what its acceptable limits are. Often, the law is looked to as a way to control or shape science. However, others see regulation as a means of stimulating innovation. Regardless, advances in science and technology are closely related to the law and legal processes, and the role of these in society is changing as a result. This proposal is to create a new network of 'law and science scholars'. It builds on an earlier event that we held in Kent Law School in 2011, which was funded by the journal Social and Legal Studies. The workshop explored the feasibility of bringing together researchers from different traditions who all share an interest in law and science, and was extremely successful. Subsequently, many of our participants urged us to look for ways of sustaining and further developing the dialogue and debates that we fostered. Thus, our proposed network will bring together people from different traditions in the arts and humanities (especially distinct areas of law) who are already working on particular aspects of law and science, in order to stimulate new ways of thinking about these issues and to push forward novel kinds research. The central aim of the network is to create a unique platform from which to explore the relationships between science, technologies, and legal processes. Whilst there are already some people working in this broad area, interaction between them has long been too limited. The primary problem is that opportunities for all these different people to interact with - and learn from - one another are rare. Most events cater for particular traditions (e.g. critical legal studies), or are focussed on a particular legal or regulatory problem in science and technology (such as genetic modification). This means that questions that cut across research areas and disciplines are relatively under-explored - and these may be some of the key matters that need to be addressed. What makes our proposal different and valuable is that we deliberately seek to bring together a whole range of different kinds of scholars with interests in diverse issues around law and science, in order to forge new forms of research in this important area. Our network will therefore focus on how science and technology have affected law and legal processes, and what the broader implications of this are for society. To this end, we will address a range of cross-cutting questions, including how ideas about law influence scientific innovation, and how this in turn creates new possibilities for developments in regulation. Furthermore, we will examine how governance and regulation is related to wider public concerns - both how law reacts to and manages these. Finally, we will explore what new methods and concepts law and science scholars need to develop in order to make sense of the nexus (or meeting points) between technoscience, law and society. The network will proceed over five events, beginning with an innovative arts event and culminating with a major international conference. The work of our group will not just be of interest to researchers in the arts and humanities; rather, it will also afford considerable benefit to scientists, as well as scientific institutions and policymakers. The activities and outcomes of the network will also be of interest to a range of wider publics - and we will actively seek to foster this through a deliberative public engagement event that will explore the insights and attitudes of interested non-academics in relation to the regulation of controversial areas of science. In sum, this network will break new ground, and be of wide academic and social relevance long after the funding for it has come to an end.","As we outline in the Pathway to Impact attachment, we expect our project to be of interest to a range of academic and non-academic actors beyond the humanities disciplines described in the Academic Beneficiaries section. More specifically, we will seek create impact within communities of (1) policy actors (broadly defined), (2) scientific professionals, and (3) wider publics. In addition to the academic outputs outlined in the Case for Support and in the Outputs section, we will produce a range of materials that aim to generate impact in diverse communities and ensure a legacy for the network. We will: maintain a project website; produce briefing papers; author a final network report; submit at least one commentary to an e-bulletin list; write a short article for a magazine such as the New Scientist or for Guardian Comment is Free; and, upload YouTube clips of talks and/or interviews with network participants (and link to these from the website). Our public engagement event (and associated media coverage) will also be an important means of generating impact within civil society.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK001728%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              'From Invention to Consumption: electronic textiles' is a joint project between Nottingham Trent University, Goldsmiths, University of London and University College London to support a series of workshops and a scoping study that will clarify the role of Design in the process of innovation - what BIS refers to as the 'innovation ecosystem'. It focuses on inventions in textiles, particularly where computing power is built into the textile, so-called 'e-textiles'. It brings together different types of people who are relevant to innovations that can take this relatively un-developed technology from the lab to the shop, transforming interesting materials into useful things. The project starts from the assumption that design is useful to this process because one of its roles is to help inventors and consumers communicate, by transforming the possibilities that can be built into materials from potentials that may not look engaging, to things that can become part of, and perhaps change, our lives. The three workshops in 2014 will bring together people from universities, large corporates and SMEs with freelance designers to focus discussion on e-textiles and to work together to feed their collective understanding and experience into the scoping study. The scoping study will review research and examples of recent innovation in textiles, as well as theories of innovation and research on 'design thinking'. It will look at the social/ cultural aspects of developments in textiles as well as likely lines of future development indicated by specific features of contemporary culture. Together, by bringing key individuals and organisations together, the workshops and the scoping study will clarify directions for future research and practical collaborations.","Bridging the divide between academic researchers, practitioners, SMEs and large corporates, the work will have direct impacts on participants from these organisations as well as on public discourse. The subject matter of the research - innovation in e-textiles - has strong potential to engage audiences outside academia, given its connection to health, sport, to 'wired' culture and to cutting edge design. The two parts of the project - a scoping report on the innovation trajectory of e-textiles and a series of workshops - will impact in different ways on these groups. The commercial participants in the project - both large and small - stand to gain directly insights into the future trajectory of innovation in e-textiles. The scoping work and the workshops are likely to identify opportunities that companies can take up in the process of market development for the technology, facilitated through further focused research. The work will directly impact on the project research fellow, broadening their experience and adding to their personal network of contacts and consequently their future employability. Participating PhD students will also benefit directly from their engagement with the workshops.  The project team has extensive experience of delivering impactful research, each engaging with the subject matter from a distinct perspective. Jefferies' extensive work at the interface between art and computing, Drazin's profile in design-ethnography and Fisher's previous work to understand the material basis of consumption in clothing and packaging give the team appropriate expertise and capacity to deliver impact through this work. This is dependent on strong cross-disciplinary participation externally, and internally through dissemination among the project participants. Both aspects will be catered for by employing a full time project research fellow for five months. This individual will work with the PI to actively maintain a project blog, Facebook group and web-page as well as preparing press-releases as appropriate, working with the NTU press office. These on-line and press routes will be used to log progress with the workshops and to connect with the creative art and design constituency that needs to be aware of the project, if not involved, in order to maintain its profile. The blog, web-page and Facebook group will be mirrored by the NTU Advanced Textiles blog. This online dissemination will be complemented by conventional means to alert people to the work by including printed matter, flyers etc. in the participant packs for the three workshops. This strategy (of online dissemination supplemented by real-world information) should mean that the online manifestation of the project is effective in disseminating the work well beyond the workshop participants.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013843%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Recent estimates suggest that over 3% of the population of England and Wales died as a direct result of the Civil Wars of 1642-51: a greater proportional loss of population than Britain suffered during World War One. This project will illustrate the social, economic and cultural consequences of England's mid seventeenth-century catastrophe in greater depth than ever before by publishing the original petitions which thousands of wounded ex-soldiers and war widows submitted in order to gain financial aid - on a free-access, fully searchable website. These petitions, drawn-up between 1642 and 1700, provide graphic testimonies of what it felt like for ordinary people to live with horrific wounds, trauma, suffering and loss. By making them freely available, this project brings to life the appalling personal consequences of these wars. It will expose a wide public audience to the significant advances in surgery, hospitals and pensions made during this conflict, while at the same time underscoring how the war's consequences persisted for generations after armed hostilities had come to an end. The project is particularly timely with the opening of the National Civil War Centre at Newark Museum in May 2015, an organisation with which the PI has collaborated since 2011. It builds upon the award of four AHRC PhD studentships on this topic since 2013, and a successful application to the Wolfson Foundation to fund a research centre at Newark. It is also the first time that a team of experts on civil war petitions has been assembled, drawn from every level of the academic ladder. The PI and Co-Is will each be responsible for co-ordinating agreed regions (Hopper - north, Stoyle - south, Appleby - east, and Bowen - Wales and the Marches). This will involve identifying the archival documents, limited transcription work, metadata capture, inputting data from the quarter sessions' order books, arranging photos and feeding content through to the IT team to assemble onto the website. The project will analyse the strategies which were used by and on behalf of maimed soldiers and war widows to obtain charitable relief. It will examine the language used in the petitions to appeal for aid and the different ways in which widows pleaded with local justices and central government to secure their deceased husbands' arrears of pay. It will also examine how petitioners represented military service, how they fashioned themselves as 'deserving cases', how they played upon magisterial expectations, and in what ways petitions reflected feelings of entitlement. The information in the petitions will develop our understanding of how the early modern poor endeavoured to sustain themselves through what has been well-termed the 'economy of makeshifts'. The geographical spread of the petitions will also be considered, as will the aims of the various regimes in granting relief.  County archivists will provide digital images of the petitions and supporting medical certificates which survive in collections scattered across the country. Our Postdoctoral Researcher will then transcribe those documents, which will be made available for searching on a website, together with contextual commentaries to guide users. Archival repositories will retain copies of both the digital images and transcriptions to enrich and enhance access to their own holdings. The website will be searchable across fields such as name, gender, parish, county, details of service, military unit, nature of wounds sustained, occupation of petitioner, outcome of petition, and size of gratuity or pension awarded. This will allow data to be mapped and compared. A faceted search will also be available. This website will provide a national resource for Civil War history in England and Wales on a scale to parallel that of the flagship European digitisation project, the 1641 Depositions in Ireland: http://www.1641.tcd.ie/","The National Civil War Centre (NCWC) at Newark Museum will provide an access point for impact for this project. Made possible by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £3.5 million in 2012, it opened on 3 May 2015. It will enable this project's research to reach an international public and schools audience through an onsite Wolfson Research Centre, a temporary exhibition leading to a permanent gallery, student internships, educational website and teachers' workshops programme. The NCWC has developed a Learning and Participation programme that is projected to reach 17,000 people per year. The Centre is keen to emphasise its national status and to cover themes that transcend Newark's civil war experience. Its management have recognised that a focus on care, welfare and medicine provides the ideal means to achieve these aims. As a result, the project's research will form an integral part of this exciting new Centre's academic resources, enriching its galleries, interpretation, digital resources and schools' programme. http://www.nationalcivilwarcentre.com  The project website aims to be highly accessible and user friendly. Its intended audience embraces groups beyond academia, such as history enthusiasts, family historians, professional genealogists, local history societies, heritage professionals and re-enactors. These groups will benefit because the free-access website will be rich in details of personal names and place names as well as a wealth of biographical detail. The project website will contain perhaps the largest single corpus contribution to plebeian surname and place name data since the collective amalgamation of parish register materials on websites like Ancestry.com. The website will be widely advertised through county record offices, local history societies, social media and family history networks.  County record offices nationwide will benefit by having the relevant material in their quarter sessions collections better catalogued and more accessible than ever before. Each entry in the website will feature hyperlinks to the relevant county archive's online catalogue, in order to encourage increased public use of their facilities. The project will also benefit the National Archives, who have identified early modern women as one of their research priorities. The project's focus on war widows neatly fits with their wider aims of improving access and developing new ways of interpreting early modern material. Their Engagement Officer has stated that this project would be an excellent vehicle to encourage county archive services to work more closely together, and thus to foster a more cohesive national archive service. A comparative dimension might also benefit the US National Archives in Washington DC, who have their own project researching widows' pensions from the American Civil War. This includes four million digital images from approximately 125,000 American Civil War widows' pension files, see: http://www.fold3.com/title_24/civil_war_widows_pensions/. Military welfare is of special, and current, interest in countries such as the UK and USA, not least because issues such as the Military Covenant and the care of service personnel injured in Iraq and Afghanistan are highly topical questions for political debate.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN010140%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The UK is the birthplace of some of the world's most creative and innovative designer fashion companies, of which many are small and micro enterprises. These companies, supply chains and intermediaries constitute the UK designer fashion industry and consist of a poorly understood complex web of interactions. The British Fashion Council has identified a number of issues that is preventing the industry from reaching its full growth potential. These challenges include lack of a formal R&D culture across the industry, lack of knowledge and contacts within the designer fashion industry and weak knowledge exchange and open innovation practices.  The FIREup project will address these issues. Specifically, FIREup will focus on the creation of a prototype digital platform that will research new models of knowledge exchange (KE) for the industry and foster open innovation. The platform will create: an accessible knowledge base for academic/B-2-B interactions, integrate research methodologies into the industry creating new collaborations between science and design disciplines, and support the industry to reduce its carbon footprint by sharing best practice.  The platform will be a research tool that delivers quantitative data identifying knowledge and asset flows. It will also be used to catalyse research collaborations linked to funding calls. New participants will register information about themselves that will provide valuable insight into research needs, cluster formations, existing networks & collaborations and KE models. Sandpits will shape open research calls to test & validate the platform. Project partners & SMEs will deliver research supported by a voucher (funded from FIREup). Outcomes of research projects will be presented as case studies, showcasing the platform and also used for dissemination activities. The platform will be online, making the data readily accessible to registered participants. It will be easily updateable to take account of rapid changes within the industry. FIREup will draw upon established networks and existing alumni from fashion focused UK HEIs to ensure initial rapid project development. The University of the Arts London (UAL) will lead the FIREup Project leveraging the social capital vested within alumni networks to engage with small businesses within this sector, particularly those that do not access or take advantage of new research developments. Research will be practice-led and respond to the need for KE between industry and the academia, including: - Relationship-building opportunities at different levels within the industry, helping SMEs to access the wider designer fashion ecosystem in order to promote their products, access new contacts and tap into academic/entrepreneurial expertise. - Exploring research and design processes in academia and industry and how new collaborations between science & textile disciplines can be developed. - Building communication & collaboration platforms, to enhance KE opportunities, develop R&D consortia and provide new research insight. A multi-disciplinary research team from across UAL and project partners will leverage their significant expertise and social capital to ensure FIREup is a success. The Centre for Fashion Enterprise (CFE) and Designer-Manufacturer Innovation Support Centre (DISC) will contribute insights into the UK designer fashion economy. Design Against Crime Research Centre (DACRC) will contribute knowledge/experience of award winning practice-led open innovation approaches to design research. The Centre for Sustainable Fashion (CSF) and Textile Futures Research Centre (TFRC) will contribute knowledge focused on innovation and sustainability. Fashion Design Studio (FDS) will support designer fashion enterprises to adopt new digital technologies. It is anticipated that the open KE platform has potential for significant beneficial legacy to the designer fashion industry beyond the project duration.","Data from the digital platform will provide detailed insight into how the designer fashion industry currently operates. This knowledge will help to develop new thinking that will lead to more efficient models of KE that can be implemented, in order to deliver increased collaborative outcomes between academia and industry. Findings from the platform will be shared by online communications within the platform and also by the use of case studies at FIREup workshops and networking events. Capacity will be developed and built by creating new, and sharing existing knowledge, expertise, methods and tools.  Public Sector - Academia gains valuable insight into how the designer fashion industry functions, obtaining new research insights into industry needs to inform further targeted research bids. - FIREup results will shape future educational fashion course content. The platform will identify emerging trends and changing needs of the industry and these can be reflected in degree courses,   as they are refreshed.  - Policy makers recognise the importance economically & culturally of a strong UK Fashion Sector. Results from the FIREup project will help shape & influence policy development that supports the  growth and competitiveness of the overall sector.  Private Sector - Designer fashion enterprises become more knowledgeable of the design fashion ecosystem and are better able to make more informed decisions. The creation of the KE map of the designer fashion  ecosystem helps to reduce market failures due to lack of information that designer fashion enterprises encounter that currently prevents them from making informed decisions. - CMT units are able to build their networks and use the FIRE platform to identify and engage in new collaborations that lead to new innovations. This will enable a culture of R&D in CMT manufacturing  units and other designer fashion enterprises. - The FIREup project will implement open research innovations and KE practices within the UK designer fashion industry leading to a cultural change that delivers a 'new breed' of designer fashion SMEs  focused on industrial and cultural innovation. Wider Public - The FIREup project has environmental and sustainability goals at the heart of the project. The platform will bring together the designer fashion industry (industry & academia) to share best practice   on tackling environmental and sustainability challenges. - Reducing the UK designer fashion carbon footprint is a priority. Tackling challenges of offshore garment manufacturing vs. local production, mass customisation, and adopting new materials, will  reduce energy consumption and waste materials, making the industry play its role in reducing carbon footprint and adopting more environmentally sustainable practices.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK002724%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Baroque (c. 1580-c. 1720) is important as the earliest aesthetic - and cultural - movement to have global impact, spread as it was through dynastic ambition, mercantilism, and missionary fervour. Latin, as a supranational language, played a major role in propagating this style. In literature, Baroque was characterized by rhetorical devices, especially through exaggerated forms such as paradoxes, anachronisms, antitheses, and oxymora that roused the emotions and engaged the senses. Interfacing with vernacular literature, the Neo-Latin literature of the 17th century contributed not only to the development of drama, but to the rise of the novel, as well as to the evolution of more traditional forms such as the epic and the epigram. Beyond belles lettres, Latin supplied lyrics to musical compositions of the time and was employed in the visual arts. In politics, Latin served as the language of treatises and contracts; in religion, it furthered the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation. It became the language of international scientific communication, used to announce and explain new discoveries. The ability to write in the common European language of scholarship was an indicator of educational achievement in an age when rhetorical and grammatical competence was demanded. Because 'Baroque' post-dates the art to which it was applied, coming into familiar use only since the nineteenth century, and because 17th-century culture was seen traditionally as a decline after the flourishing of Renaissance Humanism, this term fell out of fashion in the 1960s and 1970s. However, there has been a renewal of interest in Baroque during the past decade, due to scholarly initiatives that challenge traditional - especially European-centred - historical narratives. The term has become a focus of discussion among art historians, but literary scholars are only beginning to enter the debate. It is urgent now to move the research agenda forward - to expand on the collection of articles edited by Jan Bloemendal and Nigel Smith, Politics and Aesthetics in European Baroque and Classicist Tragedy (2016) - and to uncover aspects of a period in literature that have been forgotten, but also while looking beyond periodization in an attempt to comprehend how literary practice traverses geographic and linguistic borders. A re-examination is required from a broad range of international experts to reinvigorate and challenge past thoughts around the Baroque in literature. Our network will bring together a group of UK and Continental scholars, as well as librarians, to uncover aspects of Baroque that have been lost and to offer new understandings of literary practice and intellectual movements, rather than simply to provide further information for period-based cultural history. Our project will generate fruitful and novel interaction not only by amalgamating ongoing research, but by searching out forgotten texts in order to arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of Baroque writing. Our first objective, through this timely re-examination, is to spin off major, long-term projects, to be determined through confronting major questions relating to Latin writing and the artistic concept of the Baroque, and the use of Latin in the expression of the new ideas of the Baroque era - in politics, commerce, science, and art. By amalgamating the individual research of network participants in our workshops, we will be able to draw up a perceptive and inclusive outline of the issues underlying Baroque Latinity, and thus be able to identify the most promising pathways for long-term projects. Our second objective, through our public engagement activities, is to raise the profile of 17th-century Latin and to signal its importance in the formation of modern society. Latin is often thought of as an antiquated ('dead') language, while its use and influence lasted well into the modern era - indeed, the majority of all surviving Latin texts come from the 17th century.","Baroque Latinity will engage three major categories of beneficiaries: 1) general public, both people who already have an interest in Latin and/or the seventeenth century (such as members of Latin groups/evening classes, members of book clubs focusing on history, book collectors) and those who are first discovering these areas of the humanities; 2) professional and cultural sector (e.g. schoolteachers, librarians, library and museum curators).  In order to reach these sectors, the Baroque Latinity network will employ digital media, especially a publicly accessible website hosted by UCL that will be set up by the PI and Co-I. This will contain blogs from network members, links to library collections and digitized objects from project partners, as well as announcements of events sponsored by our network and other organizations. Moreover, the website will provide notes from the network's workshops as well as bibliographies of relevant books and articles. To reach as wide an audience as possible, news from our project will be sent out via social media. 3) academia - our project covers and is of interest to a broad range of academic subjects, within the Arts and Humanities (see 'Academic Beneficaries'). Activities: 1) book exhibitions - open to the public, in conjunction with the workshops at Merton College Oxford and Trinity College Cambridge; both of these will be accompanied by a blog or booklet. The Wellcome Collection in London will host a public event that will feature Baroque Latin materials from their collections. We will work together with the project partners to reach our beneficiaries. Also, the University of London Society of Bibliophiles and the Bibliographical Society have agreed to assist in promoting our events. Network participants and project partners will spread the news of our events through their own blogs and social media, as well as through posters and word of mouth. 2) public talks and seminar presentations (at lunchtime and in the evening) - at both the University of London (e.g., the UCL Festival of Culture and the School of Advanced Study's Being Human Festival) and at a London public library.  3) workshops - at regional schools and colleges.  Network members based outside London will organize similar events in their cities. The network's activities will introduce those who belong to hobbyist Latin groups or who attend Latin classes to post-classical Latin authors and so expand their repertoire. Book clubs will benefit from the network's activity because a by-product of our research will be bibliographies of books on seventeenth-century history posted on our website. Book collectors, too, will be introduced to new authors and texts,and thus to new possibilities for beginning or developing a collection. Within the professional and cultural sector, school teachers who offer Classical Studies will be able to enrich their classes with post-Classical Latin. Librarians will be assisted in the cataloguing of rare books by the notes and bibliographies on the network's website as well as by the description of items displayed in the planned exhibitions. Museum curators will benefit from the connections between Baroque objects and texts that the project will demonstrate: our research on the contexts of Baroque writing and the importance of Latin in the seventeenth century will suggest ways to broaden the public appeal of their collections, and our outreach events and the materials accompanying them will generate ideas for planning exhibitions and other public events.   Overall, Baroque Latinity will introduce to the general public an era when Latin served as the dominant language of international communication. Our aim is to make Baroque Latinity more visible and more accessible. Our presentations to the public will be based directly on material from our research as a network.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS006214%2F1

And yet appreciation and presentation of these all-too-often hidden treasures remains at the local level, and is often bypassed by international visitors who may go to Stonehenge, Roman Bath or Viking York, but will mostly miss out on what the rest of the country has to offer in terms of heritage. This project will help establish a sustainable framework for presentation and research of East Anglia's heritage within a bigger international picture, including engaging communities in international cultural exchange through archaeology. It is envisaged this international positioning of East Anglian heritage can stand as a model for wider strategic thinking on presentation and management of British heritage. This project grows out of two successful exhibitions on the theme of Japanese prehistoric figurines at the British Museum, and a comparative exhibition of Japanese and European figurines at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, University of East Anglia (2009-2010). These exhibitions attracted great public interest both in the UK and Japan. During the 2010 exhibition, an artefact from Grimes Graves was exhibited for the first time in the county where it was discovered in 1939. The extraordinary story of this Grimes Graves 'chalk goddess' inspired a series of further academic, youth and civic exchanges between Japan and the UK, demonstrating how powerful archaeology can be in revitalising local communities and for knowledge transfer and public engagement with new audiences internationally. This series of exchanges provides the inspiration and foundation for the current project. At a time of increasing challenges to local and national heritage authorities (including council heritage services and bodies such as English Heritage), this project will help develop capacity within communities to realise further potentials of heritage resources within their locality by clearly demonstrating the 'international significance' of these resources, and the potential benefits in developing international interest. This requires a reassessment of the linkages between archaeology amenity groups (including local societies and Heritage Lottery Fund community projects) with those charged with protecting the archaeological resource, academics, other heritage stakeholders (e.g. tourist boards), and development organisations (Local Enterprise Partnerships). Central elements of the project's work providing exposure to the potentials of international approaches to heritage will be exhibitions and public workshops, and digital media. The east of England has an exemplary record in researching, managing, conserving and developing the historic environment, including pioneering regional archaeological assessments, which informed future strategies for researching and managing what is recognised as a vulnerable and finite resource. In bringing a new 'international' dimension to approaches to heritage in the east of England this project aims to contribute to this exemplary evolving record. Using existing infrastructure (e.g. Festival of British Archaeology, Heritage Open Days), the project will foster new knowledge exchange between stakeholders, develop new means of interactive public engagement with archaeology, engaging new communities and audiences. It will provide access to examples of best practice in this area, hitherto limited to the anecdotal. The long-term aim of the project is to demonstrate how such an 'international' approach to East Anglia's heritage can inform policy and practice into the future, both in the UK and abroad.","The 'Global Perspectives on British Archaeology' project will benefit the following groups in the following ways: ~ local communities: the project will provide great potential for a wide range of enhanced interaction with heritage for a range of local communities. This will include free access to exhibitions and public workshops providing new international perspectives on our past and societies, and it is envisaged that the associated regional and international exchanges will provide great potential for opening new horizons for a wide variety of age groups. The recent example of the Thetford Teenage History Club's visit to Japan on the back of archaeological exchange is the most striking example of the potential impacts involved. ~ Public and third sector heritage organisations: The 'Guidance Notes on Internationalising East Anglian Heritage' will be of benefit to museum and other heritage professionals looking to realise the international potential of future projects, including those involving volunteers (e.g. HLF). Benefits will take the form of examples of best practice in engaging new audiences through added value brought to such projects by an international perspective. The example of the 'Dogu: Spirits of Clay' project demonstrated how an economic multiplier can come into play (turning a £375,000 investment by AHRC into an estimated economic impact of £5 million). Such impact is of increasing importance given the challenging environment for public funding of the sector. Such organisations include: county archaeology groups; museums and galleries funded by local government and universities. ~ Education sector: appreciation of the international significance of local archaeology and heritage contributes to motivating home students to engage with and understand their heritage in new ways, thus contributing not only to enhanced quality of life and creative output (as already demonstrated through the Thetford-Nagawa initiative), but also to the Widening Participation agenda encouraging more students to apply to study at university. ~ International, national and local authorities: responsibility for archaeology usually lies within government agencies, and being able to draw on arguments for international significance would undoubtedly help justify public expenditure in this sector (and would be of interest to organisations such as English Heritage, Historic England, Association of Local Government Archaeology Officers, Museums Association etc). The research will also be of interest to international bodies (UNESCO, World Archaeological Congress, European Association of Archaeologists), and to heritage organisations in other countries, including of course Japan, to which presentations would be made (separately funded) and copies of publications provided. ~ Commercial private sector: most archaeological work in the UK is undertaken by private contractors, often tasked with explaining the significance of their discoveries to the public and the research conducted in this project would aid such explanations. Recently successful organisations in this sector include the Norwich Heritage and Regeneration Trust (HEART), developed with the aim of realising the economic potential of heritage within a framework of sustainable development. The project would benefit from the expertise and experience accrued by HEART, and provide benefit to successor organisations. ~ These benefits will begin to be realised immediately, and indeed the Sainsbury Institute's existing relationships have already informing the development of for example future HLF bids. It is anticipated longer-term benefits will accrue as the research results feed into broader strategy development across the sector. ~ Research and professional skills: Staff on the project will develop enhanced public-interface skills; volunteers will receive instruction in database development and report writing; all involved will develop new international interaction skills.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FP00556X%2F1

How could a world-leading system for accessing knowledge developed using practice research transform ideas, engagement and innovation across sectors, academic disciplines and industry?  Why are such voices missing an efficient platform that could transform academic, economic and cultural impacts? This project will develop ways to let the people that perform practice research capture details of their work and share it with others. It will be informed by a report that was published in the last few months based on discussions with a large number of the people working in the field of practice research. The report established that; 1) in all fields of research, by doing something, you are engaging in practice. Therefore, the field of research into practice covers almost every area of scientific endeavour, and 2) current software for distributing research was failing the practice research community. The report contained recommendations that we aim to implement as a piece of software called a repository. This online library will allow the people who engage in practice research to make their work available to all. The project provides value for money by using existing repositories and working with established practitioners to figure out how to make these more efficient for researchers, institutions and funders.  We will be working with three repositories - one that is quite advanced in addressing the needs of practice researchers (University of Westminster/ Haplo), one that is currently working with museum and gallery content (British Library and V&A) and another that is currently good at working with ""typical"" written article content (Jisc). By testing across a range of repositories we will produce a report at the end of the project that contains recommendations to improve all of them. Key to the overall proposal is an equitable landscape for all research, in which non-STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Maths) research is understood more clearly and talked about as of equal value to papers, publications and monographs. Moving beyond the reference to non-text outputs as ""Other"", such as Film, Databases, Archives and curated exhibitions, we highlight the technical issues and lack of parity for researchers working across Arts and Humanities. The project will build upon an existing community of practice researchers who are essential to the function, role and future of the University sector, contributing nationally and internationally to the broader discussion of practice research. This community, along with the research team, becomes a kernel from which to develop a rigorous academic and technical software solution that addresses how practice research is described, stored, discovered and further elaborated.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FW007622%2F1

It will provide new pathways to innovative cultural and creative research and will provide rich data to better inform the management of material change of heritage assets now and in the future. The development of a mutual learning environment among universities, cultural institutions, and creative enterprises, will encourage a future generation of heritage scientists and practice-led specialists to address the contemporary challenges of managing material change of moveable and immoveable heritage.    The NT is home to a remarkable portfolio of heritage assets across the UK from historic buildings, monuments, landscapes, gardens, archaeological sites, as well as over a million objects in our care. The proposed upgrades and enhancements of scientific facilities, and historic digital data capture will significantly increase existing creative research capability and extend the breadth and geographic reach of our current provision to other organisations and networks. It will build on our reputation for conservation excellence and innovative cross-disciplinary partnerships, significantly increasing our support for others by providing a national-scale resource for collaboration, education, and shared training.  By exploiting the potential of portable tools of analysis we will undertake research to deepen understanding of how objects in our collections were made and used, and the cultural contexts in which they are situated. Crucially, scientific analysis will also help us to document change over time to inform choices of how change is managed now and in the future. Building on the exceptional public engagement programme established at Knole Conservation Studio, we will use augmented reality tools (AR) to enable novel approaches to develop and trial immersive content. This presents a unique opportunity to connect with the public and to share with other heritage organisations the challenges and choices of collection conservation presentation and management.   Enhanced heritage digital data capture tools, for example, geophysical survey equipment, photographometry, and handheld laser scanners will provide digital twin outputs to monitor change and enable research to make better informed choices of how we manage heritage now and in the future. These digital tools will provide new quality, multi-purpose datasets, which will support us and other historic asset managers to devise more effective interventions to maintain and adapt the historic environment to maximise benefits whilst retaining cultural value. This is particularly timely, as climate change is resulting in unprecedented impacts on historic sites.    We will develop relationships with new heritage research partners and stakeholders, especially those in under-served regions of the UK. Given the Trust's geographical reach, uniquely we will provide 'in the wild' state of the art evaluation of heritage assets by taking the tools to the assets, along with management and conservation protocols. This will enable a diverse range of researchers (including Early Career Researchers (ECRs), secondees, interns) to develop interdisciplinary capability, practice-led skills, and carry out knowledge exchange, to catalyse new creative research opportunities.  As an incremental step towards our ambitions to grow our research capacity and capability across the Trust, this project will provide the platform for creating a culture for mutual sharing of equipment and knowledge. This will be achieved through training, workshops, placements, and hosting through existing and new networks. The project will provide new economic opportunities, inform regulatory frameworks, and develop skills to meet heritage challenges now and in the future.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX009289%2F1

We will engage with those responsible for delivering a new key government policy - that of the economic valuation of nature - with a view to informing and potentially critiquing/modifying that policy. The project follows up our Research Network on the same topic by bringing the ideas that were crystallized in that Network directly to the attention of Parliamentarians and other policy-makers, via dialogue with the accountants who will be key in the implementation of that policy. The project will build on the discussion papers, book and academic papers, which explored the discourse of 'natural capital' as a mode of valuing and evaluating nature that emerged from the Research Network. (These comprise the findings of our Network, partly crystallised in the 'Glossary of terms' we produced (https://www.anglia.ac.uk/global-sustainability-institute-gsi/research/global-risk-and-resilience/debating-natures-value/glossary-of-terms ).) These already-existing outputs/ resources will stimulate the beginning of a series of new discussions that we will host in London and that will cascade further around the UK's accountants who will be responsible for computing the value of ""natural capital"". The key deliverable will be a report based on these dialogues that will be presented to Parliamentarians and to our top-level contacts at DEFRA, including Michael Gove. The timetable we envisage is realistic:  [Dec 2018 Initial discussions and planning amongst network members and with ICAEW, prior to the grant's official start.] Jan to Aug 2019 Papers, seminars, briefing document; interim documents shared where appropriate with civil servants, Parliamentarians, Ministers. Sept to Nov 2019 Production of final report Dec 2019 Presentation of final report to Parliamentarians at a special 'Chatham House rule' meeting of the 'Limits to Growth' and 'Agroecology' APPGs.  The project will be led by: Dr Rupert Read (PI (of the DNV network)), Prof Aled Jones (Co-I (of the DNV network)), and Richard Spencer (Head of Sustainability at the ICAEW, and a key player in the Natural Capital Coalition). The project details have been developed in close collaboration with ICAEW, which will provide rooms for the seminars, access to its membership, and relevant contacts, including with the Natural Capital Coalition (currently based, helpfully for our purposes, at ICAEW HQ). The AHRC Research Network on Debating Nature's Value to which this is a Follow-on-Funding bid brought a number of academic disciplines - the creative arts, philosophy, theology, literary studies and environmental humanities - into a debate traditionally dominated by economics and biophysical sciences. This bid reveals the way in which the Arts & Humanities have something unique to contribute to this issue (and, by analogy, to various similar further issues). We seek to bring about a thoughtful change in policy-makers' understanding and conduct with regard to 'natural capital'; and we seek thereby to illustrate that and how the kind of >questioning< that our disciplines bring concretely to bear is otherwise missing. This kind of fundamental questioning - e.g., of the metaphorical and potential political consequences of conceptualising nature as a kind of capital, or of ecosystems as essentially providing human beings with 'services' - is of a kind that only Arts and Humanities accomplish. Our project shows the relevance and influence of Arts and Humanities in the corridors of power; it shows how subjects that are sometimes seen as 'lightweight' or other-worldly can be seen and felt to be influential, and uniquely so.  ...And all this, at what is (because of Brexit) a crucial moment in the history of this (crucial) issue.","Here is a key example of our Network in action, with a view to Impact: http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/environmental-audit-committee/25-year-environment-plan/written/79050.html . This was evidence we submitted to the Environmental Audit Committee.  >It encapsulates the kind of perspective we will bring to the dialogues we are now aiming for in this Follow-on bid.

The study will draw upon the learning of the partners who collectively have over 55 years' experience of delivery in this field and the research findings produced by Lancaster University in September 2020 https://greenclose.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Phoenix_Project_Evaluation.pdf and also due in March 2022. PTF will draw upon a growing network of community partners delivering social prescribing in the area and explore the benefits and challenges of delivering community-based health support for a wide range of participants, examining how it can be embedded into integrated care systems, and how it can grow and flourish to enable access for those populations most in need of healthcare support. The study will use the existing network which the Phoenix and Phoenix Rising projects have grown to ensure a robust cross-section of health care providers, GP's, Social Prescribing link workers, patients and third sector organisations are involved from the study's inception through to its completion. PTF will bring these groups together to discuss the challenges and benefits of this work, to reflectively plan the development of the work and ultimately co-produce ideas and solutions that will enable the existing programme to become more scalable in terms of service offers and more likely to be sustainable to those in need of accessing such services - thereby ultimately to 'taking flight'.  Co-production, patient voice and an open and inclusive approach to our research - informed by the knowledge of our partners - will ensure that we build an inclusive, solution-focussed outcome that will enable a collective approach to expanding social prescribing offers embedded within integrated care systems.

"Funding details                                                                                                              Digital images of scores are now available in very large numbers from services such as IMSLP (International Music Scores Library Project), which has images of about a quarter of a million scores of over 70,000 pieces of music. Most of this information is opaque to computers, because a score image is a picture rather than a source of musical information. To get at the musical information, the score needs to be 'read'. While software to read digital images of words, turning them into encoded text (Optical Character Recognition, OCR), is now common and underlies such services as Google Books, the equivalent task for music (Optical Music Recognition, OMR) has proven to be a very difficult. The accuracy of the results is often low, and some researchers have reported that the time taken to find and correct errors is so great as to make it just as quick to enter the data by hand. In other cases, considerable time is required in training OMR software to get good results from a particular source. This project aims to turn the problem of large quantities of inaccessible data into an advantage, and make use of the quantity of information available to improve the accuracy of OMR. Multiple images of the score of a piece of music are often available, and to use more than one image increases the information available for the OMR task. This project will take two approaches to improving OMR through the use of multiple sources. The first, post-processing, approach will result in software to take the outputs of multiple runs of OMR software on different sources for the same piece of music, and combine these outputs into a single, more accurate, representation of the piece. The second approach will use multiple information within the OMR software (adapting existing open-source software) to improve the accuracy of recognition. A part of one score which is difficult to read will become easier if information can be used from part of another score which represents the same part of the piece. The outcome will be new techniques and software modules for OMR (both post-processing of results and new multi-input OMR software), protocols for the use of OMR with multiple sources, and information about the levels of accuracy which can be expected from OMR software.","There is enormous public interest in music, and while much of this is directed at music which, like much popular music, does not rely heavily on scores, there remains substantial interest in music for which the score is central. Making Music, an umbrella group for voluntary music in the UK, has over 3,000 member organisations. A survey in 2008 in the USA found that 3.1% of the adult population was involved in performing or creating classical music and 5.2% in choirs or choruses (2008 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, National Endowment for the Arts, Washington DC, 2009, p.44). Access to scores and the information in scores is vital for these activities. Reliable and widespread OMR has the potential to transform access to and use of scores in the same way that OCR has transformed access to books. Peachnote.com already gives some flavour of what can be achieved by allowing scores on IMSLP to be searched (to some degree) by a melodic sequence of pitches. Better OMR would both allow this to be more accurate and allow other kinds of searching. A choir director who knows that the sopranos can barely sing above a G but who has some basses capable of singing very low notes could search for music by the ranges of the voices, for example. There are similar potential benefits for music education. At the moment a teacher who wants to give an example of a particular contrapuntal pattern or procedure needs to know of examples in advance. OMR on a large dataset such as IMSLP would allow examples to be found by search. Students will also benefit from being able to search for music by content. New ways of work will be facilitated in the music industry. It is common practice now for music for video and film to be selected from existing sources, either 'production music' (pre-recorded short sequences intended to suit particular circumstances, such as 'Scottish open road') or existing compositions. (Newly composed music is typically only used for the biggest productions, for reasons of cost.) This has led to the repeated use of a small number of pieces of music, and the prevalence of low-quality low-impact 'canned' music. The ability to search scores by content will give easier access to a wider range of music, and hopefully lead to better film and video music. In the creative field, access to scores by content could lead to new ways of putting together pieces, perhaps in a kind of 'score mashup' by analogy with audio and video mashups made from selecting sounds and images by content. (See for example the research on 'audio mosaicing', special issue of Journal of New Music Research, 2006.) We make a case above that the access to large datasets, which accurate OMR would facilitate, will lead to better musicology. The consequences of this will feed through to impact for the wider community also. We can expect an indirect impact of this research to be better music education and better wider understanding of music.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL009870%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This ambitious collaborative research project uses the British West India Regiment (WIR) as a case study to explore the evolving nature of racial thought in the Atlantic world from late 18th to early 20th centuries. The WIR was formed in 1795 from remnants of the Carolina Corps of black soldiers recruited by the British during the southern campaign (1778-82). Defeat in the Revolutionary War led the evacuation of c.5000 enslaved and formerly enslaved people, including black troops. The WIR became vital for the defence of the British Caribbean colonies and also served in West Africa. The military history of the regiment has been studied and we do not propose to re-examine this.  The soldiers of the WIR were objects of scrutiny by doctors, slaveholders, travellers, photographers and others, who depicted and interpreted their bodies in complex, often contradictory ways. The project's components will utilize these viewpoints while not forgetting the agency of the soldiers themselves who were able to shape racialised ideas through their behaviour, dress, abilities and actions (in battle, on parade and while playing sport). These interactions took place against a backdrop of debates about racial capacity and the civilising mission, and the end of slavery in the British Caribbean.  The militarisation of the black subject is comparatively under-studied, yet is crucial to our perception of the plastic nature of race as a concept. Whites who feared armed black men were willing, when circumstances dictated, to place them under arms. This project aims to explore such ambivalence, explain how whites 'rediscovered' the black body in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and how evolving white understanding of the black body from passive slave to armed combatant was crucial to changing ideas about race in the Victorian period.  The overall scope of the project is ambitious but manageable. The time-frame of 1795-1914 encompasses the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and War of 1812; the abolition of the British slave trade and slavery; British involvement in West Africa; the Crimean and US Civil Wars; and the later 'Scramble for Africa'. This period saw the WIR involved in intra-imperial conflicts in the Caribbean, suppressing slave revolts (Barbados, 1816) and post-slavery rebellions (Jamaica, 1865), as well as fighting colonial wars in Africa. The project's broader historical context is provided by the Haitian Revolution; public debates about slavery and race in Britain and the USA; the growing importance of science to the medical profession; and emerging ideals of Victorian heroic masculinity. Deliberately, the project does not encompass the First World War. Instead, at a time when the 'Commonwealth' (sic) contribution to that War is being assessed, it is timely to consider the extensive and more varied history of black soldiers in the British Army. The geographical scope of the project is focused on the Atlantic world, including the Caribbean, West Africa and Britain, but also the USA and French Empire.  Under the umbrella of a long and wide history of the WIR, this project comprises three distinct but interconnected components. Two major components examine 1) the production of medical discourse about the WIR soldiers by army surgeons and physicians, and its influence on proslavery writers in the US South (Lockley) and 2) the changing image of the WIR soldier in Britain as a barometer of popular ideas and anxieties about race, masculinity, warfare and empire (Lambert). Associated with each is a PhD project: one considers white responses to the arming of men of African-descent, while the other focuses on photographic imagery of the WIR and its relation to the contemporary discourses, including tourism. A third, more focused component considers the place of the WIR within the life of Caribbean societies, particularly focusing on soldiers' participation in popular sport and the garrison as a public space (Hatfield).","By creating and disseminating knowledge about a little-known but important aspect of British imperial, Caribbean and military history, ASUA will be of great public interest. The project is timely, coinciding with the centenary of the Great War and anniversaries in the Commonwealth, notably the 150th anniversary of the 1865 Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica and the bicentenary of Barbados' 1816 slave revolt, two occasions that will facilitate opportunities for impact activities. The centenary will bring greater attention to the 'Commonwealth' (or imperial) contribution to the war and broader role of warfare in British history, while the latter anniversaries highlight the longer role of the WIR. Impact will be directed at 2 main audiences: 1) school children (Key Stage 3+), where the history curriculum includes material on the slave trade, abolition of slavery, Britain's 19th-century global impact and empire. We will work with the community-led organisation, The National Black Boys Can Association, as well as Warwick's African & Caribbean Student Society to ensure that the topic will be appealing to male and Black British students, who relatively under-perform at school. Schools engagement with the project and its findings will be promoted by Warwick's Outreach Team and the BL's Learning Team. 2) The wider public, especially Black and Minority Ethnic communities in the Midlands and London. We intend to deliver public talks to coincide with 2014-18 and promoted through online news services such as 'Minority Perspective' and organisations such as the Windrush Trust. Warwick's Centre for Caribbean Studies (CCS), which has extensive links to non-academic publics and individuals, will also play a key role. During years 1-3, initial engagement will take place via a Warwick-hosted web-site featuring images, a blog and podcasts, and a dedicated Twitter account. In addition, we will liaise with the Arts Communications Officer to secure publications in BBC History and The Historian, as well as Hodder's history review for schools. Discussions have also begun with Colin Grant, a producer at the BBC, who has written on race, slavery and freedom, and a radio programme is one possibility. Much of the impact activity will begin in the final 3 months through two interrelated media: 1) Physical exhibition: An exhibition entitled 'Africa's Sons Under Arms: Black Soldiers in the British Army Before the First World War' will launch in October 2017 to coincide with Black History Month and the CCS-hosted Walter Rodney Lecture. It will be hosted by Warwick's Modern Record Centre. A series of accompanying events for the public will be organised, such as talks by the project researchers and workshops for schools as part of broader widening participation activities at the university. 2) Online Learning Resource: An OLR will be created with the BL's Learning Team, led by Hatfield. It will consist of a fully-searchable and annotated repository of texts and images which can be used in the classroom and for student research projects, as well as sample lesson plans. Digital storytelling techniques will also be employed to create engaging, interactive paths to guide users through these materials and link to other sources. These will be organised around themes such as 'Would you join the West Indian Regiment?' and 'Where did the idea of ""race"" come from?' The investigators will run 4 late-afternoon workshops aimed at teachers from the Midlands and London in autumn 2017. These will demonstrate the OLR and its use in the classroom, as well as showcasing the wider physical and electronic resources available at each site. 4 follow-up visits to will be offered to specific schools. Data on impact will be collected throughout the project via questionnaires at the teacher and student events, Google Analytics and online feedback for web materials, social media counts, and a visitors' book for the exhibition.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013452%2F1

By using British South Asians as a case study rather than trying to examine cultural and creative engagement across all BME communities, this research will present a focused analysis of the development of and contemporary place of South Asian Arts in Britain. Given that British South Asians are a well established community in Britain this review will aim to present a chronological investigation of the emergence and development of South Asian arts in Britain. The key research question being examined is 'Why and in what ways do members of the British South Asian community engage with the arts and what value do they attach to this engagement?' Within this main research question a number of further questions are addressed: How has the South Asian arts scene developed in Britain? Which factors influence British South Asian engagement with particular types of art (e.g. age, gender, religiosity, language, socioeconomic background etc)? What role is played by South Asian arts organisations and which sorts of arts do these organisations offer? How does engagement with minority ethnic art impact on religious identity and conversely how does the strength of religious identity influence engagement with the arts? What cultural value do South Asians themselves place on the arts and how is this manifested in career choices among young South Asians? Who beyond members of minority ethnic communities engages with minority ethnic arts? Why are many of these organisations defined as 'South Asian' as opposed to Indian / Pakistani / Hindu / Sikh / Muslim? Are South Asians aware of any inherent value in engaging with arts relating to their own ethnic and/or religious backgrounds as opposed to engaging with 'mainstream' arts? This research project will also look to uncover examples of 'hidden' minority arts events which are often only advertised within particular networks and which usually take place in venues owned or run for members of minority ethnic communities including religious institutions and cultural centres. As well as undertaking a review of research and reports into South Asian Arts, an online survey will be used to investigate these hidden events through the networks created with South Asian Arts organisations. The survey will be hosted on the project website and advertised through South Asian networks and social media. The expected outputs from this project will be: 1. A report consisting of a critical review of the literature on minority ethnic arts; 2. Findings from the quantitative and qualitative online survey made available on the project website; 3. A journal article targeted at the journal ""South Asian Popular Culture"", authored by the PI; 4. Conference presentations including the BASAS (British Association of South Asian Studies) 2014 conference; 5. Community presentations to take place at venues arranged by the South Asian Arts organisations participating in the research; 6. Policy briefings for South Asian Arts professionals and relevant policy makers containing a digest of the critical review and recommendations for future practices available on the project website; 7. Possibility of dissemination via the BBC Asian Network and/or BBC Radio 4's 'The Culture Show' The audience of these outputs will be academics working on cultural value and on minority ethnic arts, South Asian Arts professionals, policy makers who need a nuanced understanding of how different parts of British society engage with the arts, and ordinary people with an interest in understanding the history and place of South Asian arts in Britain.",This section not required under the terms and conditions of the call.

It focuses especially on the topic of intergenerational justice. The project group brings together literary studies, linguistics, science and technology studies and literature pedagogy to investigate how different text types - cultural forms such as literature, social media, and literature reception in educational contexts - move between seemingly neutral climate facts (""models of"") and normative social values (""models for""). The project is framed by interdisciplinary model theory, which understands models as representations of reality that reduce complexity and serve specific purposes. The project's approach to climate models (1) understands qualitative cultural modelling of climate change as a necessary complement to the dominant quantitative scientific climate models, and (2) takes an analytical look at the intertwining of descriptive and normative components that constitutes climate debates. Three closely related sub-projects examine debates of climate change and intergenerational justice in Anglophone dramas and essays (WP 1), in social media (WP 2) and in the reception and communication of literature in criticism and education (WP 3). The project has two key objectives: 1. to investigate how different kinds of texts engage in the cultural modelling of (un)just futures; 2. to develop an interdisciplinary approach to cultural climate models that will be of wide benefit to researchers. In addition to the open access publication of project results in the form of a special issue and articles in various journals central to the disciplines involved, the dynamic project website (artistic director: Jasmijn Visser) will document the research process and disseminate the results as a virtual exhibition to a wider audience. The applicants each have a track record in internationally-leading publications on central and complementary thematic and methodological aspects of the project: Higgins (PI UK) primarily in literary studies research on climate change and in the Environmental Humanities generally; Hoydis (PI Germany) in literature and risk theory and climate change narratives; Pearce especially in digital methods of image analysis in social media representations of climate change; Schwegler in the field of multi-modal sustainability communication; Bartosch in educational research on the modelling of environmental literacy and in the Environmental Humanities generally; and Gurr in the field of model theory in literary and cultural studies and in literary studies in interdisciplinary research contexts.  The project brings together the complementary research environments of the Universities of Cologne (Multidisciplinary Environmental Studies in the Humanities [MESH]), Leeds (Priestley International Centre for Climate), Sheffield (Digital Society Network, digital methods) and Duisburg-Essen (future and transition narratives, futures research in the humanities). The applicants are all centrally involved in these and related initiatives, and are therefore well placed to build a lasting and influential collaboration in environmental humanities research between the UK and Germany.",,https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX00189X%2F1

MicroPasts initially received funding under the AHRC call for Digital Transformations in Community Research Co-Production in the Arts and Humanities and, over its 18 month duration (1 October 2013-31 March 2015), the team have developed, implemented and started to evaluate a novel model to support collaborative research in archaeology, history and heritage that draws on a combination of crowd-sourcing, co-design and crowd-funding.  We now propose to undertake knowledge exchanges and further evaluation with two aims: (1) to study and enable a community-led model of platform and project management that is sustainable in the longer-term, and (2) to inform heritage policy and practice in the UK, and guide investments in participatory projects that use crowd-sourcing and/or crowd-funding. With those aims in mind, we plan to engage interested MicroPasts contributors in discussions about how they might take responsibility for the day-to-day running of the MicroPasts websites, and then develop the technical resources, guidelines and skills that are necessary for a community-led model of platform and project management to become fully operational. With policy-makers, analysts and practitioners in the heritage sector, we wish to review the methods and results of the evaluation conducted over the lifetime of MicroPasts so far, to steer further reflection and develop knowledge about the benefits generated by the use of crowd-sourcing and crowd-funding, for individuals, communities and heritage, and about how best to capture these benefits.  We will respond to MicroPasts contributors' stated desire to take forward the work conducted until now and help maintain the digital resources created in the lifetime of MicroPasts, so that they can continue using and benefiting from them. In addition, the knowledge exchange programme with volunteers will offer both contributors and current core staff meaningful learning opportunities, which can also be important for employment and career development purposes. Beyond significantly strengthening the co-creative nature of MicroPasts, we expect that this model of community-led management could potentially provide an exemplar for the longer-term sustainability of other web-based participatory projects that use crowd-sourcing or crowd-funding. This knowledge exchange programme will produce tutorials and guidelines that will be made available open access for anyone to download and re-use. Furthermore, knowledge exchange among heritage policy-makers and practitioners will bridge a substantial knowledge gap about the ways in which more participatory and digitally interactive cooperation with the public can support heritage organisations in re-designing and improving their services in the context of economic downturn. In addition, the project will help heritage institutions and funding bodies to face the numerous technical, ethical and methodological challenges of evaluating community- and crowd-fuelled projects. This strand of the knowledge exchange programme will be conducted via workshop discussions, followed by the write up of a summary paper and evaluation guidelines, together with a full report on the MicroPasts evaluation. These resources will be made available online, but also circulated directly amongst the extensive network of heritage professionals with whom the project staff and their proposed collaborators are in contact.","The Follow-on project will have compelling outcomes and considerable impact at several different levels, on two main groups. The first point to stress is that MicroPasts volunteers will be participating in a knowledge exchange programme aimed at developing and implementing a community-led kind of platform and project management. The idea behind this programme emerged from discussions with regular volunteers and from their desire to take forward the work conducted until now and help maintain the digital resources created in the lifetime of MicroPasts, so that they can continue using and benefiting from them. In addition, the programme will facilitate the sharing of different skills and knowledge and, thus, offer to volunteers and other core staff meaningful learning opportunities, which will also be important for employment and career development purposes.  The second point to emphasise is the transformative impact of this initiative on heritage policy and practice. By the end of the Follow-on, key representatives from these two groups participating in the workshops will have co-produced new knowledge on the value of crowd-sourcing and crowd-funding in the heritage sector, to the benefit of heritage and heritage institutions, individuals and communities, online or offline. While there has been initial thinking on these topics, there hasn't yet been a moment of focussed and collaborative discussion resulting in operational recommendations for the heritage sector. Workshop delegates will also reach conclusions on best practice for evaluating web-based heritage projects that leverage crowd-sourcing and crowd-funding methods. The outcomes of the workshops will be key to understanding whether new policy and new guidance should be developed to address the specific needs of crowd-fuelled projects, and also to inform future grant-making decisions in these areas. In addition, our evaluation guidelines will be useful for grantees, since, for example, only very general suggestions are currently offered by HLF on the best ways to measure the results of their projects. For heritage practitioners, we expect the core value of the Follow-on to be that of obtaining clear advice on the most cost-effective solutions for including crowd-sourcing projects in their educational and curatorial programmes, and crowd-funding as part of their development strategies.  To communicate the project outcomes to national and international audiences of researchers, policy-makers and practitioners in the cultural sector, we will write a paper summarising and commenting on the workshop discussions and publish it in a relevant journal such as Cultural Trends. In addition, the report on the evaluation of the MicroPasts project and the evaluation guidelines that will be produced will be made available for download from the MicroPasts main website and archived open access with UCL Discovery. We also, importantly, rely on the input of workshop participants and particularly of those mentioned in the Collaboration section, to disseminate the outcomes of this Follow-on widely, amongst their professional networks.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM00953X%2F1

This will be achieved through critical reflection on the outcomes from a range of relevant projects across the Connected Communities portfolio such as community gardening, filmmaking, built environment, product design, digital media theatre, music, cultural learning and visual arts interventions for those with early stage dementia. Juxtaposing the results from different projects will result in innovative ways of thinking about resilience and propose solutions to issues raised by community partners.  Four seminars will be undertaken consisting of presentations, workshops, and breakout sessions. Synthesising learning points from across the Connected Communities portfolio will help draw together the diverse, yet shared issues. Equal Arts, the C.I. and main community partner will recruit a group of older people who will play a full part in the workshops and explore what resilience and connectivity means to them. Researcher participants will also be invited to bring along community partners to ensure discussion is grounded in their lived experience. Policy makers such as Arts Council England will also be involved and part of the management group to ensure that they are part of the process.","The following will benefit from the research, directly or indirectly:   Older people who currently engage with the arts and those who do not; Policy makers such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; Arts Council England and their equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; Arts practitioners; Gallery and museum practitioners, for example BALTIC and Beamish Museum; Third sector organisations, Age UK Newcastle and North Tyneside, Equal Arts, the Quality of Life Partnership; Medical profession (including academics, GPs, medical students and care staff); Arts and health practitioner community;  Workforce development professionals and employers in the care sector working together to raise the quality of care  Carers working with older people. They will benefit from the project in the following ways: Increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy - this will be achieved through arts policy makers and practitioners having a greater understanding of the role of creative interventions in developing connectivity and resilience in older people informing practice and policy formulation. It is anticipated that the research will make an important contribution to spending decisions within cultural organisations. It will also better evidence the impact cultural practice and research can have on communities, using the language and methods most closely associated with central government and Treasury's Green Book (HMT 2003, O'Brien 2010). Gallery/museum partners will benefit in terms of greater knowledge of how to develop their programmes to foster resilience in older people. It envisaged that networking opportunities will lead to the development of future projects.  The involvement of researchers, community and voluntary organisations and policy makers all working together will contribute towards developing thinking between health and arts sectors on how engagement with the arts can be seen as a valid part health care. Charities and community groups will be able to use research findings for advocacy purposes. Providing the opportunity for community groups, charities, policy makers and academics to work together over four workshops will help the different sectors understand the requirements of the other(s) - for example, community groups will develop greater understanding of how to frame bids to fulfil policy requirements. Also of significance is the contribution to the evidence base that is required by government to demonstrate the value for money of investments in the arts. Enhancing quality of life, health and creative output - older people will benefit through the development of creative interventions targeted towards developing connectivity and resilience. This work will contribute to the nation's cultural provision and the wellbeing of older people in the UK. It will facilitate the development of more cost-effective public policy and services. Wider participation amongst older people will reduce social isolation, enabling the development of social networks.  Research and professional skills - staff working on the project will develop which they could apply in all employment sectors. All participants will develop research and professional skills which they will be able to apply in all employment sectors. The mixture of presentations, break-out sessions and workshops will develop a range of skills and maximise the potential for all to contribute. It is hoped the four workshops will provide a safe atmosphere in which participants can untangle misconceptions, express a lack of understanding, or highlight problems. It is envisaged that for the practitioners the impact will feed directly into their practice, for the wider arts community the impact will take a little longer, 12-18 months.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL013274%2F1

This project, in contrast will develop knowledge and understanding of how press councils in comparable jurisdictions from around Europe approach the difficult questions in media ethics of balancing freedom and responsibility. Significantly, it will also examine news work itself and explore the extent to which ethical codes impact on the daily working practices of journalists, news workers and those directly affected by the activities of the press. The isolationism that has characterised the debates about press ethics has hitherto hindered the possibility of benchmarking and learning from other societies in which problems of ethics and regulation have been addressed by legislators, journalists and the general public. By examining the top European nations in the World Press Freedom rankings, this project will develop a set of evidence based recommendations to the UK regulator (IMPRESS) that can be used to provide a benchmark for the UK press code of ethics. This project will directly help IMPRESS and other organisations review and update future iterations of their codes and related guidance. It will help establish norms of journalism ethics in these areas. Moreover, by examining how the press councils in these countries intersect with the law (e.g., do they have statutory status or recognition; are their judgments recognised by the courts; how do their codes overlap with the law?), we will gain a much richer understanding of how press regulation operates in practice, rather than in theory. This would then offer the possibility of learning from best practice as to what can work and what can be viable in addressing issues around press self-regulation. By holding them accountable to more comprehensive standards, this research will allow regulators to support publishers in achieving a new status and profile, which will allow them to both pursue the classical liberal rationale for journalism as 'watchdog' or 'fourth estate' - and challenge the hegemony of the corporate press. This could have far-reaching social impact given the technological and societal changes that that the news landscape faces not only in producing viable and sustainable codes of conduct but also helping to strengthen this new sector of the news media and protect groups that have hitherto been subject to press abuses.","There are a number of beneficiaries of the research and impact will be generated at various levels: Individual journalists (citizen and traditional), regulators and the UK journalism industry: the key findings of the research will be disseminated amongst industry players including the Press Association and the Guardian newspaper. How might they benefit? Journalists will have cause to reflect on the broader scope of press ethics and regulation given the international environment and range of new challenges and opportunities within the new media ecology. Activities aiding change: Stakeholder workshops; capacity building workshops; project website; final written report. Regulatory bodies and organisations who have developed their own ethical codes of practice, including IMPRESS, IPSO and the National Union of Journalists How might they benefit? Regulators and organisations with their own set of ethical guidelines will be able to adapt and refine their ethical codes of practice which will be underpinned by substantive research. Activities aiding change: Stakeholder workshops; capacity building workshops; project website; written report, end of project conference.  Organisations (participants and stakeholders) such as the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom; Index on Censorship; Article19; the Ethical Journalism Network; Association of Journalism Education; Society of Editors. Outside the UK the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom and individual press regulators across Europe. How might they benefit? A wider appreciation and understanding of the principle and practice of freedom of the press will be garnered from interviews and stakeholder workshops. This will then be incorporated into their own specific programmes and press ethics principles. Activities aiding change: Stakeholder workshops; capacity building workshops; project website; MOOC, written report, end of project conference and published research.  Minority groups and organisations who have regularly been subject to significant discrimination and abuse by sections of the press.

"Funding details                                                                                                              The rapidly unfolding revolution in digital technologies continues to have profound effects on the major institutions of the creative economy, especially the library, the publishing house, the museum and the institutions and businesses involved in the development of digital technologies. One of the major aims of this project is to link these institutions and utilize the untapped potential in knowledge exchange by creating an active interface for users and producers within the creative economy. Perhaps the most striking of contemporary developments in this new technology is the still growing potential of the mobile phone or tablet application. We think that this innovative technology brings wonderful opportunities and specific problems for the creative economy. We propose to undertake three strands of research. First we want to explore the potential in the technology of the mobile phone and tablet application. There are already some apps in use in the museum sector - which do little more than offer a catalogue with some added sound; similarly, publishing houses can advertise their books or even circulate them in this medium, and libraries can provide access to catalogues. We think there is a huge creative opportunity here to create apps which give much deeper object histories, which link producers of knowledge with archives, which offer multi-medium experiences to enrich the experience within the museum or library. It should be possible to create an app which would link objects in different museums and countries; which link objects with published research or unpublished archives; which offer the experience of researchers or artists in producing material with audiences who have participated in events - and so forth. The creative possibilities are huge, and, with the practical help of those working in the development of apps along with those working with digital humanities in the other areas of the CE, our first aim is to develop work which will stimulate, educate and direct future development in this area. Second we want to investigate the ""best practice"" for such technology. There is a strident tension in contemporary cultural life between proponents of the ""creative commons"", and proponents of regulation. On the one side, the difference between developed and undeveloped countries in access to knowledge is seen to contradict the liberal democratic ideals of exchange and freedom. On the other, the demands of copyright together with the concern for the circulation of illegal or damaging materials requires regulation. How can the political and social aims of the creative commons find any form of accommodation with the wishes of regulators (or the profit motives of business). We wish to produce a document in this area which will be of help for all members of the creative economy including regulators, which lays out the issues and solution in a systematic way. Third - following from the second - we intend to research the complex legal issues of copyright in the sophisticated and rapidly changing world of digital humanities. What are the barriers to the attribution of rights to a multi-media app with material from different countries, institutions and forms of ownership? We will explore this both in a theoretical way, with regard for European law and the potential of regulation, and in a practical way by attempting to secure the permissions for a test-case app. Second, we will explore the issues of practical regulation. Recently a mother in a museum was asked to leave the museum when she wished to take a picture of her child in the ""dressing up"" section (part of the museum's outreach and engagement programme), because the attendant was instructed that if such a picture included an artwork in the background, it would infringe copyright. Can sensible regulations be established which take account of the demands of copyright and the power of the phone for visual reproduction?","Close collaboration with the conceptual and practical challenges regarding the development of ""apps"" will be demand-led by the partners of this knowledge exchange project. Regular workshops between the Research Associates and project partners will allow continuous feedback and adaptation of content and theoretical discussion to stakeholders' needs. Academic involvement will ensure broader guidance and expertise into all of the relevant different areas for the seminars and, in collaboration with CE stakeholders, will culminate in the production of a guide of ""best practice"" and broader exchanges at a final conference. The project therefore responds to the flux in knowledge exchange and creation originating from digital transformation in the arts and humanities and in society more broadly, as well as to the opportunities and challenges posed to museums, publishers and libraries in this regard. Hence the project has immediate impact for the project partners in the following manner: The project links with the digital ambitions of the University of Cambridge Museums. The project will facilitate, develop and extend the Museums' plans to develop digital resources for public engagement and access to its archives that are partially supported by funding from the Arts Council England (ACE). In line with its objectives and vision, the project will be drawing from content and concepts from the museums, library and publishers for the discussion of the potential of apps as an output of this project. It will also be in direct collaboration with the development units in digital humanities at both the Cambridge University Library and other local libraries, and at Cambridge University Press, and offers the first space for the collaborative discussion of this innovative technology. The impact of the project for the wider CE sector will be threefold, and come through the published exploration of the creative potential of the ""app"", the published investigation of best practice, and the published discussion of the legal implication for intellectual property raised by use of such technology. Along with these publications, each designed to be of maximum use for the stakeholders in the creative economy, there will be the direct impact on the development units in digital humanities of these major institutions from the process of the workshops, colloquia and final conferences, all of which will be promoted through the University of Cambridge Communication Office and appropriate channels of the project partners. The three final publications will be of great help for all those working not just in the tourist, museum and publishing businesses, but also in the important potential interaction between them. This work could change the experience of museum going as an event within the creative economy.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK002686%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              The aim of this project is to provide a critical review of the role of digital engagement and access in shaping cultural experiences in the context of museums, galleries and heritage. Since the late 1990s the potential of the digital world for generating new ways of engaging with the heritage sector, widely defined, has been a key focus of both academic work and cultural practice. Academics and practitioners alike have explored the potential of digital technology for offering new insights into our understanding of the past for an ever wider section of society. This has taken a number of forms, from 3D modelling of archaeological sites to large-scale digitisation projects for the long-term preservation and curation of material heritage. At the same time, colleagues have explored the ways in which the digital world can be used as a tool for increasing and broadening public participation in heritage culture. On the one hand, this has focussed on how the internet can help provide a 'shop window' for museums, galleries and heritage, and translate this into physical visits to sites. On the other, the sector increasingly seeks to use the digital sphere to provide a space for more dynamic, two-way engagement with heritage culture, aimed at providing a complementary experience to the physical visit that can, in turn, enhance the cultural value of heritage through a range of phenomena (e.g. user-generated content, online communities, crowdsourcing projects). The last decade has seen a huge number of digital projects take place on a variety of scales operating in a whole host of heritage cultures around the world. These provide a plethora of case studies for the potential of the digital both to widen access to the world's heritage and provide new ways for individuals and communities to experience and consume heritage, from the Europeana Foundation - an interactive forum which provides access to millions of artefacts from across Europe - to small scale projects such as the 'Ostalgie Kabinett' which helps support community engagement with the historical memory of the former East German State. At the same time, there has been a growing emphasis, both amongst scholarly and grey literature, on how we measure the value of this activity and what we mean by value in this context. As Parry (2010) highlights, this is an area of activity which can easily 'fetishise the future, and neglect the past'. Or it has potential, somewhat counter intuitively perhaps, to help limit access to material culture, locking it away behind a 'protective' digital wall (Cameron and Kenderdine 2010). Our review will examine this tension through the critical lens of 'cultural value', placing discussion of digital engagement within the broader literature on interactivity and participation with heritage per se, the potential for co-production in research and the ramifications this can have on the question of the 'ownership' of heritage, all issues that shape current conceptualisations of the relationship between the physical and the digital sphere. The aim of this CR is threefold. 1) It will give an overview of the ways in which the heritage sector currently engages with the digital world, providing a range of international case studies in order to highlight leading-edge practice globally. 2) These case studies will be embedded within a critical analysis of the scholarly and grey literature, and in particular an investigation of how the literature has sought to understand the issue of 'value' in this context. 3) The findings of the critical review will be evaluated, via a workshop to be held at Leeds, by an international group of heritage professionals in order to explore what they perceive to be the continuing gaps in the literature and potential new directions for museological and heritage practice. This will, in turn, also lead to the production of briefing document for heritage professionals looking to enhance their digital engagement with audiences.",This section not required under the terms and conditions of the call.

"Funding details                                                                                                              Until the late twentieth century, the print medium was the most important vehicle through which political imagery was translated from one culture into another. Reproducible, portable, and affordable prints crossed international boundaries with far more facility than formal portraits and monumental sculptures and reached a significantly broader audience as a result. Political iconography was appropriated, hybridised and naturalised throughout Europe in the early modern period but no example of this cross-cultural borrowing is as dramatic or compelling as that of Peter the Great's creation of political propaganda for his Westernisation of Russia. It is both essential to examine the early history of printed propaganda at a time when the demise of the print media at the hands of the internet has been heralded and timely to consider its role in Russia as we approach the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution in 2017.  'The Power of Print: Dutch propaganda for a new Russia', explores the single most important moment in the history of the political print in Russia: Peter I's 1698 commission of Dutch printmaker Adriaen Schoonebeek to establish a new school of printmaking. Dutch technology, expertise, and iconography were applied to the project of propagandising the Westernization of Russia, with models borrowed from Romeyn de Hooghe's prints celebrating Stadholder and King of England William III's 'Glorious Revolution'. The printed image and its control by the state rapidly became central to the Russian government's discourse of power and identity - a practice that continued through the Great Reforms of the 1860s, the Revolution of 1917, and the construction of the Soviet state. The examination of the construction and use of political imagery in Russia provides insight into the complex issue of how different cultures borrow and assimilate political iconography to support, nuance or change their own notions of leadership and national identity. The project's international and multi-lingual research network comprises experts in various aspects of Dutch and Russian print culture from iconography and print publishing to collecting and reception. Scholars from a range of disciplines and institutions in the UK, The Netherlands, and Russia will come together to engage in collective, collaborative research addressing the significance and impact of the appropriation of Dutch imagery, iconography, and ideology and its translation for use in some of the most important images produced in the Petrine era. The proposed workshops, training sessions, and events will forge collaborations that establish access to previously unstudied research material and archival resources and connect specialist knowledge from different fields and scholarly traditions. This constellation of varied specialists will engage with novel ideas about the development of political iconography and the relationship between the printed medium and cultural self-definition.","This topic has the potential to engage many different constituencies as the importation of a visual iconography of power from the Netherlands into Russia, with the attendant machinery for mass production and wide dissemination thorough the medium of print, offers a remarkable example of the larger issue of cross-cultural translation and assimilation. The significance of Peter the Great's establishment of a printmaking school is obvious in the Russian context, but its potential ramifications extend well beyond Russia's borders and the Petrine era and this can be appreciated by some consideration of the subject's potential to interest and instruct non-academic beneficiaries.  Non-academic beneficiaries of our research include diplomats and members of government who seek to understand the early history of Russia's relationship with Europe; members of the press interested in the origins of the modern media and the much heralded demise of the print medium; UK museums interested in collaborating with great, if lesser-known, Russian institutions such as The Russian Museum and the National Library in St. Petersburg; and secondary school students of history, cultural studies, media studies and Russian. With the territorial boundaries of the European Union, the definition of its mission, and the future of its economic might in flux, issues related to the complexities of national versus collective trans-national identity are more pressing than ever. The history of Russia's sophisticated hybrid culture, which has long been in dialogue with Europe, is crucial to understanding its current position on issues related to everything from foreign policy to cultural exchange. Our research will contribute to this political discussion by illuminating the origins of Russia's relationship with Western visual culture as well as its relationship to both its past and present cultural identity. Though Peter I's propaganda prints, replete with allegorical figures and classicising motifs, may now seem old fashioned, his use of the print medium as a political tool was the cutting edge technology of his day. Just as Twitter and Facebook have been credited with bringing about the 'Arab Spring' through cross-cultural communication and information sharing, Peter I's use of the print medium revolutionised the conveyance of political ideology and dissemination of propaganda and our examination of the birth and development of the political print in Russia will be of interest to those engaged in and studying the modern media. Our research also has the potential to contribute to school curricula not only with subjects relating to Russia, such as AS Level Russian History 1881-1914, but also as a case study in 'critical viewing'. The goal of our workshop in the Cambridge Festival of Ideas is to encourage critical viewing not only of political images but also of the more seemingly casual imagery that we encounter on a daily basis. The cognitive and visual tools required to 'unpack' the political prints of the past are equally applicable to contemporary political imagery and our discussions will be designed to teach students how such messages are conveyed, thereby revealing their goals and biases. In an age in which images are ubiquitous, critical viewing is a crucial component of critical thinking.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FJ00569X%2F1

The discussions will pay particular attention to how the senses and emotional perceptions are evoked in urban environments and to how they can be understood and researched from different disciplinary perspectives such as history, sociology, geography, or museum studies as well as from different professional perspectives such as urban planning, urban marketing or museum curation. By doing so we hope to show how research on the senses helps to understand the relationship between history, personal experiences and feelings of attachments in a multicultural European context.  We will organise four meetings (three workshops and one international conference) in three European cities: London, Cologne and Barcelona to compare urban experience and connect European scholars and urban professionals from diverse fields such as city museum curators, urban planners and urban marketing specialists. There will be a core steering group of academics and urban professionals which will help to identify key areas to discuss and we will invite a range of local and European participants to each of these workshops. The aim of the workshops is to bring together a diversity of experts working on the city and to explore together, existing and new methods to research and represent the sensory emotional realm in cities. To do so the workshops will have an 'active research day' component during which participants will have to trial different methods to research the sensory realm in a particular street in each city. From the discussions in the workshops an online 'toolkit' will be created on a website that both professionals and the general public will be able to access on their mobile phones as they walk around the city. This toolkit will provide resources and pilot case studies for each city that illustrate some of the sensory methods discussed and developed throughout the workshops.","The aim of the network is to bring together for the first time academics, urban professionals and city museum curators across Europe to discuss how to research, represent and curate the sensory-emotional experience of daily urban life. Policy-makers, local government:  The interactive website built during the project will make available a toolkit of sensory research methods to research citizens' attachments to urban environments. We expect that this toolkit will help urban policy makers and local governments across Europe to gather qualitative data about what environmental features are important markers of place attachment and emotional well-being for a diverse citizenry. To put it simple, sensory research methods are a unique tool to gather how to turn a space into a meaningful place. The research network findings will offer particular insights into how contemporary European multicultural cities demand particular frameworks of interaction. Commercial/private sector (urban branding/marketing/architecture): The urban marketing and branding sector plays now a crucial role in shaping the urban economy and in attracting visitors and investment into the city. The lived urban experience provides the 'raw material' on which to base their campaigns. At the same time these urban professionals research and display what they view as the marketable sensescapes of the city. This network presents an opportunity for  a) closer discussion of these processes from a variety of views b) a comparative evaluation of such methods across distinct cities in Europe in order to share existing approaches and generate new ways of researching the sensory-emotional landscapes of cities.  Third sector/charities/museums: Museums are constantly looking for new ways of making exhibitions more interactive and experientially relevant to the general public. The resources and information gathered from the research network on the interactive mobile website and edited book collection will offer a valuable resource for museums to experiment with new curational formats. We also envisage that charities involved with a spectrum of disabled groups will find the findings useful to galvanise policy support for more accessible cities or as a repository to conduct their own research on experiencing the urban realm.  Local communities/wider public: The interactive webpage will be available to the general public to download on their phone or tablet and will allow the public to access in new ways the urban realm.  Additionally, any peer-reviewed publications arising from this grant will be registered on Brunel University's open access institutional repository: BURA which is ranked 7th in the UK by the Ranking Web of Repositories. In 2014 there have been 14,034,444 downloads performed to date.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FM006379%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              Participation is a common feature of research and social design projects, between academics and designers and communities. There are many reasons for participatory research and design in that it, for example, reduces power imbalances between academics and citizens and helps produce projects that are relevant to the real world. There are however concerns that participation in research, especially young people are involved, is not as real or as substantive as is claimed and instead there is a form of contrived participation or compliance. There are many reasons why this is the case but we focus on two:  1. Academics are under pressure to develop clear plans of what they intend to do to get funding and ethical clearance, and there is pressure that the research is successfully implemented creating high-impact and robust academic findings. Thus when the research begins and the participants participate what they are asked to do tends to be predefined and there is a hope that they will fulfil their roles to make sure things run to plan (Fox 2007, 2013; Dentith et al. 2009). 2. When young people participate in research, there is a tendency for researchers to perceive and engage with them in terms of their deficits rather than their abilities and assets. So a participatory project might work with a group of young people to teach them how to be an artist or a designer. Some argue that this is a form of control of young people, trying to make them fit into the project and by extension what they researcher wants the project to be (Foucault 1997, Vromen and Collin 2010).  The aim of the research project is to work with and treat young people in terms of the skills, knowledge and assets they already posses and seek to create ways of working that help them self-organise to do things they would like to do. We will work with two groups of young people with impressive skills and abilities in DIY digital making (Manchester Coder Dojo) and self-organisation (Woodcraft Folk). The research focuses on how we as adult researchers learn from cutting-edge design practice to create a space that supports the young people to self-organise. It is important to recognise that the intention of the research is not a 'let the pieces fall where they may' experiment of whether young people can self-organise - this question has been answered and young people can do this admirably. Instead, we will pose a 'challenge' involving a series of conditions (i.e., your parents must let you do the activity) and ask them to self-organise to do something they want to do and give them a budget of £3,000.  The research will have two components, from the adult researcher and young person perspective.  1. As researchers we will carry out participant observations of how the young people respond to the challenge of self-organising and whether this is an effective way of bringing young people together and avoiding contrived participation. Then, after the research, we will write autoethnographic accounts of how we as adult researchers engaged with the challenges of letting go of the power in research situations to young people.  2. As part of the challenge we will ask the young people to record and document what they did and how they did it. We do not want to impose any particular way of researching on them. We hope they will use a range of print and digital media to share what they did and why, which we will curate appropriately to celebrate their achievements.  From the research we will produce an academic paper and a two-page findings report to share with practitioners.","The main outcome of the project is to challenge the contrived participation of young people in research and design projects by developing a constructive and positive alternative around enabling young people to self-organise. To achieve this, from the researcher side, we will produce a series of 2 blogs per researcher on the project WordPress website and develop these into a two-page 'findings' report and an academic paper (target journal Co-Design). These outputs will be shared through our personal and academic networks (e.g., BERA Youth and Social Justice SIG), and the networks of our partners (e.g., Woodcraft Folk, the Coder Dojo network, the international Learning Hive network). Part of the Challenge will be for the young participants to document and communicate their participation in the project using whatever format and media they would like to use. We cannot state what form these outputs will use but we would aim to work with the participants to curate these young PressBooks, Storify or something similar. We will share these outputs, again, on the WordPress website and through the networks of the research team and our project partners.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003829%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              This project will bring Volume House Builders (represented) by Taylor Wimpey, built environment academia (represented by academics on a North-South axis from Edinburgh, Sheffield and Kingston Universities) and SME architecture practice together on a shared research project - a framework for developing a series of 2-3 other embedded projects - the primary aim of which is improving VHB provision and knowledge exchange across partners. In doing so we will share good practice and model novel forms of engagement across an industry in critical need of innovation. The built environment is perhaps the most ubiquitous example of the creative economy in modern Britain, yet is generally overlooked and undervalued in this context. The UK construction industry contributes around 10% of UK GDP. The work of the professions that drive it is therefore of vital importance to our society. Their expertise is reflected in a strong global reputation but the market is shrinking (RIBA Building Futures Report, p.39).  In 2007, the Labour government announced a target of building an extra three million homes in England by 2020 to help deal with the growing demand for houses. At the same time it set up the framework to be world class in the delivery of zero-carbon homes by 2016. According to the Calcutt Review of Housebuilding Delivery this would 'stretch' an industry (2007, p.7) not yet ready for these demands. The need for bulk delivery of sustainable housing remains the same, even after a change of government. Local authorities look to housing associations and private sector developers such as the VHBs to help them achieve these demands however the recent recession means that house builders are struggling more than ever to minimize their costs. This is likely to impact on design quality which, as CABE research has indicated was poor, even before the recession (CABE, Space in New Homes, What Residents Think, 2009 ). Our project focuses on improvements to the supply chain. The Calcutt Review has identified the need for VHBs to work with partners with the 'necessary expertise' to make this happen (2007, p.8). This is where architectural SME practice and academia come in. There is a great deal of, largely unacknowledged, research potential in SMEs in the architectural creative industries, yet these practices are under threat - their traditional market is being taken over by large interdisciplinary conglomerates (RIBA, Building Futures Report, 2010, p.32).The project will provide the necessary support to allow these firms to deploy their creative energy in a wider industry context, to build on their research base and to develop new business models.  Academia has an important role to play in giving SME practices access to cutting edge research. Through the embedded research projects our departments will become a shared resource of both equipment and knowledge where practitioners and academics can exchange knowledge, similar to the MIT's model of 'Fablabs', at the same time providing opportunities for academic researchers to test their ideas in a real world setting. There are three elements to the project: - Knowledge Exchange through the Ideas Lab and the 2-3 embedded research projects that emerge from them disseminated through partner networks. - Innovation resulting from the 2-3 embedded research projects developed by architectural SME practice and academia in partnership with Taylor Wimpey. - Development of practice based research through the above activities and through the Housing Practice Research Review to be undertaken, in partnership with the RIBA, through which we will be able to identify the current state of practice based housing research. The report from this review will act as a platform for research in this area and as a framework for a Research Practice Guide, the focus of a series of CPD events. These are the ingredients of a strategy to expand the reach of project and to change the face of VHB housing.","In the long term (ten years) this pilot project, if developed into a larger centre, has the potential to bring about: - Improvements to the quality of our built environment, bringing benefits to health, leisure and tourism and a reduction in crime. - Improvement to the image of the housing industry in Britain, a recognition of its world leading capability in this area and its economic competitiveness at a global scale. - Improvements to housing policy. - Improvements in the effectiveness of engagement between VHBs and local authorities. - New strategies to address education, skills shortages and employment within the housing industry. - Inform good practice in the provision of new homes. Much depends on the precise nature of the embedded projects, but our aim overall is to bring about the following benefits: [1]Volume House Builders (VHBs) - VHBs will be exposed to the low cost, low risk, potential of novel forms of engagement with architectural SMEs and academia - The introduction of incremental innovations in VHB activity to refine the shared space of their developments, increase consumer choice and hence competitiveness.  - The introduction of new business models, moving away from the house as consumer item and investment towards house as long term lifestyle choice within a resilient community. - The project is likely to provide VHBs with additional tools for community engagement. [2] Taylor Wimpey - Currently it is difficult to differentiate between the products of the VHBs. It is hoped that this project will enable Taylor Wimpey to develop the distinctiveness of its work based on the research excellence achieved through this project. - The project will help Taylor Wimpey to improve its current offer and competitiveness. [4] Architectural SMEs - Survey the extent and type of housing research currently taking place within architectural SMEs. - Provide support in developing new funding streams for research. - Provide sophisticated and specialized skills through CPD activity and academic Fablab facilities to allow SMEs to deliver to the global market place. - Ally SMEs with larger industry providers, exchanging design and research knowledge for business acumen and modeling novel forms of collaboration. [5] RIBA - The project will promote the value of architectural input in new settings. - It will endorse the RIBA as the leader in architectural research as well education. - The HRPR will provide a platform of evidence to the RIBA's claims to being a global leader in the field. - The project will give direction for future developments in architectural education. [6] Design for Homes - The project will promote the value of good home design. - The embedded projects will explore particular areas of concern voiced by Design for Homes during the Ideas Lab process. [7] Local Councils - The project will encourage VHBs to give greater consideration of the way that their developments can add to existing communities. - The embedded projects may address issues of procurement and shared ownership of benefit to local councils who are under pressure to create new homes. - The project will bring about improvements to design quality and the built environment. [8] Housing Associations and Charities  - The good practice developed in the course of the project will be transferable to other housing providers. [9] Home Owners and wider community - Greater consumer choice achieved through incremental changes to VHB production. - Improved use of community space within VHB developments is likely to be achieved through recommendations from embedded projects. - Improved design quality achieved through embedded projects. - More resilient VHB communities leading to stability in house prices. - The embedded projects are likely to result in opportunities for greater community engagement and customisation of homes - Greater cohesion between VHB developments and wider community.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK002651%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              'Records of Early English Drama North-East' (REED-NE) is part of a massive international project to assemble a complete record of surviving sources for medieval and early modern performance in Britain. REED volumes are to scholars in literature and theatre what Pevsner is to architects and art historians. REED's main office at the University of Toronto coordinates a team of researchers who trawl Britain's archives by region and edit their findings to an internationally recognized scholarly standard. The volumes which have already appeared have revolutionized our understanding of British performance history, replacing a view based largely on conjecture with one derived from detailed factual information about performers and the social and financial organisation of performance. REED volumes have redressed the London-centric imbalance of research obsessed by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and drawn attention to the many forms of anonymous performance in regions which have often been unjustly seen as 'marginal'. REED-NE, the latest stage in the series, will find and edit all records pertaining to drama, music and ceremonial in England's North-East, from the earliest sources (around 9th century) to 1642.  REED-NE will cover Yorkshire (excluding the city of York, whose records have already appeared), Durham and Northumberland, in a collection of five or more volumes published by Boydell. To date, discoveries include: 1. A medieval sequence of liturgy and drama about the Sacrament which linked the lay community with their ecclesiastical city governors (Durham).  2. Child drama and misrule ceremonies (Boy Bishops and Lords of Misrule from Durham and West Yorkshire). 3. The earliest known evidence for three types of folk drama: the Stag Ceremony (before 1280, abolished 1315); the Plough Ceremony (from 1378); and the Man/Woman performer (1433-4) (all Durham). 4. New evidence relating to mystery cycles in at least four cities (Beverley, Doncaster, Durham and Newcastle). This will reduce the reliance of scholars on the probably untypical cycles from York and Chester. 5. A major stand-alone biblical play (Hull's 'Noah'). 6. Rare evidence for a Paternoster play (Beverley).  7. Performance traditions in noble households, including the Percies (Northumberland), the Ingrams, Talbots and Wentworths (West Yorkshire), and in the houses of lesser gentry in all North-Eastern counties. 8. An important body of information concerning illegal recusant drama in North Yorkshire. This will transform the historical understanding of the polemic use of drama by Catholics in provincial England. 9. A wealth of evidence about town waits, travelling performers, and patrons; we hope to discover and map performance circuits and locations from at least the later Middle Ages onwards.    The REED-NE volumes will be accompanied by a Companion volume discussing the historical and cultural significance of our findings.  Our findings will also be linked to an interactive map of provincial England on the REED Patrons and Performances website at Toronto. Geo-coding is only now being adopted for literary projects. Visualising research data with GIS mapping will offer a new perspective on historical performance in England and contribute to the advancement of the Spatial Humanities. A summer festival in Durham in 2016 will showcase our research to academics and the wider public with a conference and an exhibition of objects and manuscripts pertaining to religious and secular drama at Durham's World Heritage Site. Based on our collected records, we will stage medieval and Renaissance repertoire at Durham Castle and the Cathedral. For the first time since the 9th century, the Lindisfarne 'Harrowing of Hell' - probably Britain's oldest surviving drama - will be performed. All events will be freely accessible. We expect our work to have a major impact, on our discipline worldwide, and also on regional communities and their awareness of their heritage.","We shall make the research results of REED-NE accessible to the general public through an exhibition, a performance festival and public talks. These will all be publicised through libraries, cultural centres, the Friends of Durham Cathedral, and the Little Theatres Guild of Great Britain. The University's PR Officer and the Director of the World Heritage Site will liaise with regional and national media. There will also be a designated, freely accessible project website, hosted by the Institute for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Durham University, to give observers an opportunity to follow the progress of our research, and to publicise associated local initiatives; a comments facility will encourage feedback. We expect specific opportunities to arise from REED-NE for a number of institutions and commercial interests in the North-East of England. For the third sector, a fuller picture of the history of performance in the region will be of benefit to museums and other institutions involved in cultural history (including those within Durham University, where our 2016 REED-NE exhibition will build on the successful 1992 University Library exhibition on Early Drama in Durham). The Durham World Heritage Site already enthusiastically supports the project (see their supporting letter). Our plans for an exhibition and a performance festival (see 'Objectives' and 'Summary' above) give an idea of possible third-sector activities elsewhere in the North-East. We expect this beneficial effect to extend beyond obviously historic towns like Durham and Beverley, to places whose importance to the history of performance is at present virtually unknown, such as Doncaster and Newcastle (which both had mystery cycles, including a surviving Newcastle play about the building of the Ark) and Hull (where an unusual Mariners' Play of Noah was once performed). Secondly, there will be an opportunity to increase commercial activity by developing new tourist and performer-based attractions in the North-East. Some historically-based events already exist in the region (e.g. early music festivals in York and Hexham; the Lumière Festival in Durham, which is inspired by Northumbria's Lindisfarne Gospels; and Durham's Mystery Plays of 2000 and 2010, which partly relied on work already done for the Durham REED volume). In Durham, the organisations which will benefit from an increase in visitor numbers during the festival include the Cathedral, the University (through lettings of college rooms), and hotels and other businesses in the city. There is undoubtedly scope for further comparable projects in other places throughout the North-East, but they are unlikely to spring up unless local communities can gain access to a better knowledge of their own cultural history. REED-NE will help to achieve this. The project's most important legacy will be to give the communities of the North-East a heightened awareness of their own cultural past. We have already established links with local parishes and major churches, especially Durham Cathedral, where the Dean and Chapter have given the project warm support (see the accompanying letter from the Dean of Durham); the Cathedral Friends have hosted open lectures on the ongoing research for REED-NE, and are keen to hear of more discoveries. There are obvious opportunities for similar links to be developed with other major churches, such as Beverley, Hexham, Selby and Wakefield, and with local dramatic societies and other groups of performers. We have already given a popular open lecture to the annual conference of the Little Theatres Guild of Great Britain (2010), and are eager to pursue further opportunities of this kind. In short, local response to REED-NE has been enthusiastic. Performance history is a crucial part of the heritage and collective memory of England's North-East, and the volumes published by REED-NE will provide ready access to that heritage for generations to come.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FK003054%2F1
"Funding details                                                                                                              When Darwin was developing his theories of evolution he read avidly in popular natural history magazines and sought out information from an army of almost 2000 correspondents. Such engagement with a wide public in the construction of science became increasingly difficult with the development of professional, and highly specialised science, but the emergence of 'citizen science' projects has suggested a new way forward. With the creation of vast data sets in contemporary science, there is a need for a new army of volunteers to help classify and analyse the information. The Zooniverse platform, started in 2007 with 'Galaxy Zoo', now has over 800,000 participants who contribute to projects from astrophysics to climate science. Significant discoveries have already been made by these volunteers in the field of astronomy. Yet, the structures by which these volunteers might engage with professional science, and through which scientists themselves might draw upon their findings, are not clear, and researchers on the project have been turning to nineteenth-century models of communication to find ways of harnessing this huge popular interest in order to increase the rate of scientific progress. The information revolution in our own age has parallels in the nineteenth century which saw an explosion of print, and journal publishing; in 1800 there were only around 100 science periodicals, but by 1900 this had jumped to 10,000 worldwide. The project brings together historical and literary research in the nineteenth century with contemporary scientific practice, looking at the ways in which patterns of popular communication and engagement in nineteenth-century science can offer models for current practice. The research is timely since the digital revolution, and open-access publishing, are about to change forever the processes and forms of scientific communication and exchange. The project will be based at the Universities of Oxford and Leicester, in partnership with three of our most significant institutions: the Natural History Museum; the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons, and the Royal Society. Researchers will draw on their historic collections, uncovering the extraordinary range of largely forgotten science journals of the nineteenth century, from the Magazine of Natural History (one of Darwin's favourites), to Recreative Science, or Hardwicke's Science Gossip: an Illustrated Medium of Interchange and Gossip for Students and Lovers of Nature. They will also work with these institutions' science communities, addressing questions about the creation and circulation of knowledge in the digital age, and looking at innovative ways of breaking through the public/professional divide. The Zooniverse will extend the range of its work, creating four new citizen science projects which will both accelerate the rate of scientific growth in these areas, and add an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 to the dedicated ranks of citizen scientists. Drawing on the historical research, it will also develop new tools to enable better systems of exchange between professional science, and this growing army of volunteers. As part of the project there will be public symposia in the Natural History Museum, the Royal Society and the Royal College of Surgeons, as well as an exhibition in the Hunterian Museum, and a performance lecture by Professor Marcus du Sautoy. Science has suffered in the public mind from its seeming aloofness and impenetrability. This partnership between humanities and science researchers aims to break down some of those barriers, and to create a truly productive public engagement with science which will enhance the ongoing development of scientific practice.","The research will have an exceptionally large range of beneficiaries. 1. It aims to raise to a million, or more, the numbers of non-scientists who participate in the development of scientific research on the Zooniverse platform. Early investigations have shown that many of these volunteers on the 'citizen science' platforms have no prior experience of science at all, but once their interest is developed they can go on to engage in quite sophisticated further research and calculations. The projects are pitched in such a way as to make them accessible for all ages, from teenagers through to those in their nineties, and for citizens across the world. 2. The website developed to accompany the research into nineteenth-century science publishing will appeal to an equally broad spectrum of beneficiaries, from amateur naturalists, or astronomers, to members of the public interested in the history of medicine. 3. The talk in the Natural History Museum's popular 'Nature Live' series will be targeted explicitly at school-age children and families, and together with the website could form the basis of school project work. 4. The digitisation of key titles by the Biodiversity Heritage Library will ensure a permanent legacy, which can be enjoyed by future generations who might be tempted by the intriguing Science Gossip, or the Magazine of Natural History. The attraction of these journals is that they are written for a broad audience and need no specialist knowledge; they are also often beautifully illustrated. 5. The exhibition at the Hunterian Museum will give the museum a chance to open up some of its rarely viewed collections, and will enhance public interest in, and understanding of, the development of medicine in the nineteenth century. 6. The public symposia at the Natural History Museum and at the Royal College of Surgeons will offer further opportunities for members of the public to engage with the research and to gain new insight into the 'hidden history' of science development. 7. The performance lecture by Marcus du Sautoy at the Royal Society, would bring new audiences into that institution, and raise the public profile of questions relating to science and the processes of scientific discovery. The benefits will be cultural and educational, as detailed above, but also economic. For citizen scientists, who were perhaps turned off from science at school, or had to drop science subjects too early in their education, the project will offer a way to stimulate enthusiasm, and develop new capacities, from detailed focus and application through to the development of complex mathematical skills. These skills will be highly transferable in the labour market; the added bonus of a sense of achievement, and personal potential, could also lead to a greater sense of ambition and empowerment in the job market. The economic benefits will also extend to science, which will be able to draw on an ever increasing pool of skilled labour to analyse the datasets that are being developed. Finally, as the name suggests, the practice of 'citizen science' will bring a new sense of citizenship and communal engagement. The findings with reference to publication patterns will also be of value in contributing to the current complex debates about online publishing, and the relative merits of commercial and non-commercial models of information exchange. They will have an impact both on commercial science publishing, and also that of scholarly societies, and other public organisations which publish science-related journals.",https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL007010%2F1
