        <p>The AHRC Grants Topic Browser is built upon the findings of topic analysis conducted on research grant applications that have been awarded funding by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) between 2013 and 2023. For a detailed description of the methodology, please refer to the project's <a href=https://github.com/kuslitsanna/AHRC_awards>GitHub repository</a>.</p>
        
        <h4>Topics</h4>
        <p>The 32 topics identified here have been generated using a combination of unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniques (LDA and seeded LDA) in a heuristic manner. The goal was to arrive at a classification of the documents in the corpus that is both statistically robust and intuitively meaningful to a human observer. I have labeled the emerging topics based on my interpretation of the documents identified by the model as most strongly associated with the given category (Most Relevant Projects), and the cluster of terms idenified as having the highest probability of appearing in the associated documents (Most Frequent Words). The topic labels are of necessity imperfect. When selecting them, my aim was to find broad concepts that best capture the semantic overlap within each category.</p>
        
        <h4>Data Source</h4>
        <p>The data analysed here is sourced from publicly available information provided by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) available at <a href=https://gtr.ukri.org/>Gateway to Research (GtR)</a>. The analysis focused on research grant applications, excluding studentships, fellowships, and training grants awarded by the AHRC.</p>
